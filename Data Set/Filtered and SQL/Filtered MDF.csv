(First paragraph is relevant to story later, as it explains how  we first met)
I am currently 23years old. My story begins from high school 10 years ago. A decade ago when I was in high school I was minding my own business when this transfer girl came into my class. Let’s nickname her Stella for privacy reasons. I met my bestfriend due to the fact that when she instantly saw me she had the urge to get close to me. As the distrustful and highly sceptical guy I was due to my upbringing coming from a dysfunctional family where I didn’t receive much love and care growing up. I was very confused and sceptical of one day a girl who I didn’t know or was attracted (not saying she was ugly ,she  was pretty but I just felt nothing for her) to in any way suddenly wanting to be my bestfriend and coming to talk to me. For weeks she kept trying to talk to me during lunch and recess. Eventually we got closer and we would hang out everyday. I was still sceptical about the bestfriend part but I eventually throughout the years I accepted it and she really became my bestfriend in my heart. She obviously didn’t like me in a romantic way I think. Or maybe I was just thicc in the head and didn’t realise it so I never made a move on her because at the time I had my own problems at home and it was constantly on my mind and al the stuff teenagers went through. But Stella lit a spark within my heart. Which I didn’t realise at the time. But one thing for sure was that she made me feel special. Wanted. Loved and someone who accepted me and wanted to be my friend. Which really made me happy. Of course even though we had the bestfriend stigma and talked about never things we never actually went too deeply into ur own personally lives. It was always about general topics about everything.  I never went into my family life details because that was something highly personal as Of course she dated guys in school and she dated this one guy who was popular and was my friend back when we were in primary but after always seeing me and Stella so close he got really jealous. As her bestfriend I would comfort her listen to her and be their for her whenever she needed. I stood up for her many times to the other guys because as her first ex Clinton was popular he loved telling all his friends about their relationship and they had many problems and struggles. I stood by her obviously as the bestfriend when people talked shit about her or asked me about her. Even though sometimes we had an off and off relationships because I didn’t want to go in between her relationship as she told me that Clinton was jealous that stella was close with me. I perfectly understood the reasoning as a guy. I didn’t want to make her life difficult. However a Few times stella was kinda cruel to me in a way. Where we made plans to see a movie but she would leave me hanging the last minute. One time we were suppose to see a movie that night together that I really wanted to see . But she suddenly changed. I didn’t know why at that time but accepted it. So I asked my family to go with me. And low and behold whilst going to buy the tickets I see her and clinton going to see the same movie . I walked straight in ignoring her knowing that she saw me with a stone face and she had the face of “oh shit I got caught face” (i was raging inside). Because I would have understood if she just told me the truth. I would be perfectly be fine with it, but she didn’t. The next couple weeks was spent me ignoring her at school. But eventually We started talking again because I missed her. Another time when she was dating another guy because clinton her first boyfriend and her were having a spat and they broke up and we’re seeing other people I think she dated this guy roger and she told me one time she wanted to try being with a more older and mature guy also Personally I saw it as her trying to get back at clinton for dating someone else whilst they were fighting previously even though she never admitted it. One day I was invited along one day because I thought she wanted to hang out with me at the beach with her friends. In the end I got turned into a third wheel and most of the time I was alone hanging by myself . I was basically a spectator playing with sand by myself. To see them all lovey dovey and she basically ignored me nearly the entire time until one of her friends mentioned to her. I feel sorry for your bestfriend why did you invite him if you are just going to leave him alone. Mind you This was the first time she introduced me to this new boyfriend and I wasn’t really close to her friends.


Okay let’s Let’s fast forward to me and Stella. High school ended. We didn’t have a proper goodbye to each other. One year later down the road of no contact and me and her not knowing what happened to each other. I finally realised in my heart that I missed her more than just a bestfriend and finally got the courage to confess to her. I didn’t know if she was still dating the roger . But I had to confess either way or I wouldn’t forgive myself and be at piece I had to let her know. Because I couldn’t contain that tiny spark which turned into a raging fireball. I chose her birthday which was  in a few days and I got her a gift and went to see her. We rekindled our friendship I confessed.she was shocked that I would like her she expected me to find someone better. I told her I loved her I enjoyed her company that you made me happy and feel special. That’s all that mattered. I courted her for three days and she rejected me 47 times before finally saying “yes” I was really determined. To be with her. 3 years passed by. I was so totally in love with her to the point it was blind faith and blind love. We had many disputes due to the fact that our hobbies where completely opposite . (Keep in mind this was my first relationship. Yes I was a virgin. I am inexperienced in love but I knew what real love was. As someone who craves for love who didn’t receive love growing up I knew what I wanted. Stella was obviously experienced hence the story arc on top paragraph, and she had two prior relationships before me,which later she told me was very abusive and the second guy roger beat her and forced her into having sex, this happened after we broke off after high school , and I was shocked and angry this happened when I found out). I knew she lost her virginity to Clinton since highschool already. Even so I loved her truly and I accepted everything. She was hurt to the point that when she was telling me about it she was literally shaking. But I didn’t care. I wanted to be with her. And told her I love you for who you are and accept you no matter what). Eventually after one month I loss my virginity to her and she was shaking before we did the deed. I did my best to be gentle and before we did it I looked into her eyes and asked her “do you trust me” and kissed her forehead . But she believed in me that time and trusted me. I’m only saying this because personally to me. Nowadays if  a guy sleeps with a girl he’s seen as a hero yet when girls sleep with guys they are seen as a h0es. Call me old fashioned but sex and kissing was really special to me and I wanted to give it to the person I loved which was stella.  I loved anime/games/drawing/ dancing. She liked keeping in touch with all the social media/ vintage and she was really insecure about anime due to the fact clinton her first ex also liked anime but he use to collect all the perverted merchandise for example mouse pads with a picture of a big Boob chick that supports your wrist. I told her I loved anime for the amazing way it always delivered different perspective in a Creative and imaginative way. But she never wanted to give it a try. We did have things in common like we were Buddhist and shared same values about life. And that we had the bestfriend relationship thing going and we’re comfortable sharing things with each other. We were comfortable . I called her lotus because she was into Buddhism so much she always projected herself as a pure white lotus and she called me light because I was that bright light in her life. Eventually our values and beliefs  clashed and it turned into fights. I made mistakes . But they were never severe . Example Playing video games with girls but never flirting or crossing the line ofc just she didn’t like the fact I played games with them. I promised I wouldn’t play anymore because I wanted I make her happy. I tried for a while but  I sometimes couldn’t keep it. As gaming was something I really enjoyed . She wasn’t a gamer herself she hated it. She held it against me all these years always reminded me how I was a liar, kept calling me a cheater. Mind you she also broke promises to me as well, but I always forgave her and they were actually more severe than mine but I always ended up forgiving her. I told her my family problems and she used that as an attack on my character. She tormented me with it all these years. Something I couldn’t change. It was really hurtful and harming to my self esteem.  Throughout the entire relationship she kept comparing me to her ex’s and saying they made her happier. She compared me to social media couples online or her family. Mind you I was never rich and I told her since the very beginning of our relationship. She told me she knows and didn’t mind she loved me either way. I couldn’t spoil you like the people you see on Instagram living the luxuary life . I did everything I could for her to make her comfortable as I could and feel loved and special just like any man would for the person they love. Since I couldn’t always afford fancy gifts and present I made most of the things I gave her by hand and spent nights and hours doing it.even skipping my gaming sessions and hobbies with my friends because she was more important to me. She tried to change me in a lot of things to fit her ideal version of the man she wanted But I realised after everything  if she really loved me and accepted me she wouldn’t change me but bring out the best in me. But as the love blind fool that I was. Even though she hurt me . I always tried to see the best in her no matter what. Of course I got hurt and yelled back when she hurt me with all those words and actions she did. But it was never as bad as the way she abused me. She made me feel low about myself I felt miserable . But I always cheered myself up because I was like “ as long as she’s happy”  then I was happy. She made me feel like I didn’t deserve her. Constantly reminded me how much better she was and how all these rich guys ask her but she declines them all. Because they don’t know Buddhism and understand about life that you shouldn’t be material.  I remmber once I told her I would get her a MacBook Pro, Cost  $3000 . I worked on my summer job for my uncle for 2 months straight . To save up for it. But I had school fees next year, which costed $500 . I told her  sorry I couldn’t get you MacBook like I said because I told her I had fees to pay  but I bought you the next best thing a $2500 zen book. She gave me an ugly frown and she wasn’t pleased. Then she acted like nothing was wrong.but that first reaction she showed for 5secs forever stuck inside my head.  And had always weighed on my mind . Another time I was thinking of getting her a GoPro as a gift so we could take pictures together . Instead I bought her a $1000 sony camera that was on sale, her first reaction and words to me where “is it more expensive than the GoPro” I told her yes it is, and her smile beamed up and she was happy. She liked to say I suit and look better with guys who are bigger. Your too skinny and not that tall. Eat up. Most important when we fought. She never thought she was wrong about the things she said. She “said to me I never wrong” one day she even said to me. “ money solves all my problems, I’ll be your slave for a few more years. But then I’ll leave” I thought those were just angry words that time because we talked about it later. And she didn’t apologise but she calmed down and I I let it go. Because I was a love blind fool. She didn’t make it into university after high school because of all the relationships troubles where was having ( refer back to paragraph one) but  I supported her believed in her and encouraged her the entire way. I even did her work / essays and assignments for her. Eventually she made it into her university  undertaking 5/12 primary school education so she could become a teacher. I ended up doing 90% of ever assignment for her for the entire 3 years of her bachelor degree . Till she graduated . She didn’t even let me attend and take photos with her on that day. The only things I couldn’t do was sit her final exam but I spent hours making notes from her lectures and helping her memorise and learn it before her exam. Time I willingly sacrificed and wasted , because I thought of her as my only one and wife.who I would marry , grow old and die with hand in hand. Keep in mind I also didn’t make it into university after high school , I went tafe, struggled and failed. Kept trying  and eventually got into my chosen field of medical science at a good university . I don’t come from a rich family , Stella came from a above average family , as her father who’s rally a good man owns a mechanic shop and since young , didn’t let his wife(stellas mum) work and made her stay at home. Whilst he worked 7 days for many over 30years. So she had a role model that she wanted someone like her father and expected me to treat her like a princess . Because my dumbass didn’t know better and I truly loved her and wanted to treat her like a princess I didn’t mind. I did my best to live up to her expectations and studied my ass off. So I could make the big bucks one day and show her family I deserved her and support her because she drilled into my head that I was lesser. That I was lucky to have her. . Even though I’m not one of this naturally gifted people . I was pretty average I just worked harder to get to where I was. But I always fell short from those students who had a better foundation than me. As I wasn’t wealthy to hire tutors since a young age or get the best teachers. Throughout the relationship she would never allow me into her family gatherings or join her family for dinner or any sort. When we went out together she wouldn’t show affection or allow me to hold her hand or touch her in public around the place we lived. We always had to travel atleast an hour away before we could display our relationship. She didn’t tell her friends. One time she said to people when they asked our relationship were , only just bestfriends. It hurt me really bad. But in the end she always had a way of her words. She was very sweet. Too sweet. She knew the right words to say. The right buttons to press and had me wrapped around her thumb. I loved her so much I fell into her net. I trusted her with my life. And never believed she would betray me or harm me. Eventually after all the argument and discontentment that had build up over the years. The red flags and signs finally built up and my brain finally overpowered my heart for once which was the one taking control of myself this entire time. I told her . The problems within my family got worse and worse and I told her about it but she didn’t seem to be paying attention or caring much. I said to her after a movie one day Look I want to focus on my life now I can’t help you do your work because I’m struggling with studies and my situation at home. I always shared everything with her the good and the bad I didn’t hide it. and I want to study properly and it’s getting harder, I love you and I need to focus so I can get a good job and support you in the future. You’ll have to complete your masters degree yourself. And then She flipped. She brought up all the past mistakes . Made it such a big deal as if I cheated on her and banged another girl. Eventually we ended up arguing out of anger we broke up. We have been doing this thing on and off for the last three years of the relationship only difference was that as each time we did it ignoring each other got longer and longer. And it was always me coming back to her because I missed her so much. I didn’t care even though I was right . I wanted to see her and be with her. My love for her was more important than my ego or pride or always wanting to be right like stella felt.  And we always got back together. Even though we ended up fighting again later. 

So one year later. I fix my problems at home. I fix my shit together  and I’m ready to begin again with her. I tried to contact her during the one year break we had between us in 2019 it’s nearing her birthday near Christmas I was going to finally restart anew with her and make her finally want to see my family. Afterall she kept giving excuses to meet my family and wouldn’t let me see her family all these years. I accepted it all. I texted her first. Butterflies was in my stomach I was happy I was excited it was the feeling as if I was falling in love with her all over again I could finally see her again. All the promises of never giving up on each other. The countless times and nights and hours we spent talking about our future life. Travelling marrying . Being there for one another. Never giving up. She told me that “I’ll be her last guy, if she doesn’t end up with me she’ll shave her head and be a monk” we promised countless times to never let go. You were the only one she said. 

Then .... She tells me “I’m with someone else,he found me, it wasn’t intentional”  then she starts saying he’s a better man than you. That she doesn’t trust me. That I’m a liar a cheater. I was shocked I was like what. This entire year I didn’t see anyone else. I never talked  for another girl. I didn’t even play any video games because I was getting my life back together. Everytime when I wanted to give up I remembered stella and our future together and it helped me power through the day. Countless times throughout that year apart when I was about to fall I woul stand right back up. I was shocked to read what she said . I thought she was joking just to get back at me because during our years she would go to some pretty petty and  extreme lengths to hurt me and make me  crazy or jealous . One time she made a fake Instagram account and googled a picture of a good looking dude and pretended to text herself and print screen the chat to me that she was seeing someone else. I thought this time was the same. So I was in denial. I was hurt again. But I didn’t believe it. I started messaging her. Asking her “stop it , I wanna see you , let’s start over I’ve handled all my problems I’m ready to create more memories with you and we can continue where we left off” eventually she told me to come to her house and talk after a few more days of me pestering her because I believed she was just throwing one of her tantrums again for me leaving her too long. She let me time into her house and her mum was nearby she had that kind of expression when she saw me like she was looking at her most hated enemy that I was worthless in her eyes. When I came in my mind was clouded as many thoughts were going through my head at once. But deep down I was going maybe it’s a prank or a joke. This can’t be real. We’ve been through so much. I’ve loved her for 10years we’ve been through so much. Our promises. Words and vows to each other. Countless nights and memories I showed her I was here for her and loved her.  She sat me down but left a space between me and her and clearly said to me “ it’s over”, I’m seeing someone else I don’t want to see you ever again. I don’t love you.  I’ve got a new bestfriend he’s so much better than you “She didn’t give me a chance to talk and only only said her part and called me “selfish”And when I tried to talk “why? And ask her what about all the promises. She wouldn’t even hear it. Her mum came and also attacked me and said “the past is the past “ she didn’t want to give me an explanation of her betraying and abandoning me. Why did she move on? . I was so overwhelmingly hurt and shocked no words were coming out of my mouth. My mind short circuited. My heart wanted to explode out of pain and grief and sadness. The memories of our 10years went flashing before my eyes. Her words of love. Loyalty and forever being faithful and real love were flashing across my mind. It was an overwhelming experience. I was so shocked even their was a delay in my tears as they didn’t  come out until I exited their house and went I shakily walked back into my car. Words of desperation came out of my mouth that time. “ can we still be friends, will I ever see you again” and she shut me down. She and her mum attacked me over my mistakes over the past. And how I got angry and said mean things those times and that didn’t you break up a year ago. But all along. Stellas mum knew I did her daughters assignments. She said she didn’t approve of me officially but she let her daughter see me all those years and we were more than bestfriends . As Stella tells her mum everything. I did get mad at times after being hurt by Stella’s words and I was immature about it . I confess throughout the relationship but I never attacked her first they were always words of anger because she hurt my feelings all along when I was just trying my best for her but she didn’t understand me . And she twisted it around as an attack on me . When she knew it was always her daughter stella instigating the attacks on me. Putting me down humiliating me and insulting me. I was speechless. I took it all. Because I was under so much shock. My first experience of mental shock in my life where nothing made sense to me anymore. The pain was OVERWHELMING. Once I went back to my car I broke like a dam. Tears came rushing down like a waterfall and I screamed and cried outside her house inside my car like I never cried before. Eventually I managed to get back home in one piece. And I my family noticed that something was wrong. Because I had the expression of a walking corpse. I told them leave me alone I needed time. They didn’t ask . And left me alone. Because they knew once I was ready I would come and talk to them. Despite my family problems my parents were atleast understanding in some way. Despite having their own issues which I do not wish to discuss.

I sat on my bed listless like a zombie . Couldn’t eat couldn’t sleep. I only had 1 hour sleep all day. In the morning I would walk up and down my room like a crazy person. Thinking and thinking. 10years of memories flashing in  my eyes. Every words. Every action. Every smile. Every laughter. Every tear. Every cry was slowly winding inside my mind. All the things we stayed up and talked about. The moments we made love. Her smell. Her face . Her laugh. Trying to process everything where did I go wrong. Is this my fault. Why did she do this. What is happening. It’s nearly a week and the pain only keeps growing. This continued on for about a week . I felt a tight pressure in my heart and it wouldn’t go away . It’s like someone was pushing Down on on my tiny heart and it was hard to Breathe. (I realised now later it was anxiety and if it continued my heart was about to burst from pressure as I close to having a heartattack and I could have died). For 7 days I only had 1-2 hours sleep as I was up all night drowning in sadness. Drowning in nightmares. Only fell asleep due to exhaustion. I drank water only to stay alive. I loss a lot of weight. I drank alcohol one night after abstaining from it for 3 years because stella didn’t like me drinking and i was only a casual drinker as I only drank in social events but she forbidded me from drinking it saying it was for my health and that her dad barely drinks. I thought it could numb the pain of t sorrow. That was totally wrong a bad move on my part. I took the strongest alcohol I had. It didn’t make me drunk just made me incredible emotionally more unstable and I couldn’t hold back my tears anymore. it just amplified the pain i was holding in and I burst out crying so loudly. My family couldn’t wait anymore and they rushed in and Made me spit it out. What was wrong. I told them everything about what happened with me and stella. I knew they were deeply hurt and angry. But they didn’t show it because they knew they had to calm me down first because I was at the point of collapsing. I swear in my entire life I have never felt so much suffering and pain . I never felt such overbearing overwhelming and desolate pain ever. And it still lingers within my memories and on my mind and heart today. It’s a like a shadow that follows me everywhere. I can’t shake it off. They comforted and explained me that I didn’t do anything wrong. It wasn’t my fault. They were upset at me I could see but held it in because all these years as I was dating stella I told my parents how good she was how she was Awsome. My parents from the very start didn’t like stella because my parents are the opposite of me. I’m quiet and an introvert my parents were always social and outgoing and have a lot of people experience. They know through life how to judge people. Throughout the years as my parents they noticed how me and stella fought through the phone and words we exchanged when we wee both angry. How she hurt me what she said. And my mum especially told me how she didn’t like her. She saw me always doing her assignments.  She knew I was head over heels for her and that this was my first love. She couldn’t stop me anymore because she said it was too late even. Your in too deep. Always stopping my hobbies and even studies to go to her and help her in whatever she needed, was like her personal butler and taxi. My mum told me before She isn’t the right one for you . But I didn’t listen. My rose tinted lenses were super freaking HUGE(loveblind) I didn’t listen to my parents warnings. They told me through the years a few times and we got into arguments over it. And it only hurt me worse. Because I realised how right they were all along after talking to me what real love was about and how if she really loved you she wouldn’t have shouldn’t have done this. That I shouldn’t have let her get away with it. I should have walked away. But they said to me at the end they were so glad. So glad things ended. You gained experience. You know know what a real woman should be like. The right woman. That it’s okay your a man . You have nothing to lose. Your still young and only 23. Their are so many other fishes in the sea. How can you say she is the one when there are 7 billion people on this earth. What’s the chance of that one being right next to you on the first go. None of my family liked stella even my sister said so but they stopped saying much after how much I defended her over the years and always bit back  at them if they said anything bad about her.  I was really an idiot.It only made the pain worse in my heart because I realised I was an idiot. I was a dumbass. There’s no greater fool than me on this planet. I wanted to ram my head against the concrete and end my life. I felt so ashamed so stupid. So low. I eventually ended telling some close friends I made online through the gaming world since as an introvert I didn’t really have many friends in real life. Because they didn’t really treat me as a good friend from high school  so I didn’t mind losing them.  Back then all I thought I needed was stella as she was my bestfriend and also my girlfriend who I treated like my real wife. I didn’t think I needed anyone else. I eventually called her one night because I was still in denial , just so happened she was with her new bestfriend/boyfriend. She said basically humiliated me and said “he’s a better man than you” and passed the phone to him. I realise later I was so stupid. And desperate but that’s all I was feeling at the time because I found it so hard to digest the reality of my situation. My world was crumbling. The funny thing was . The guy kept saying and flexing his business and acting cocky like a prick. Saying “I’m stable and got a business” I’m a better man than you ever were. The dumbass I was I was hurt . When I think back I’m so angry at myself for not saying anything and taking all this bullshit. I cant believe stella who always said to me that she was never into materialistic things and Buddhism. That’s who she projects herself to be. Because she liked to played  the victim. Would say this guy is better than me. Yet the words he’s spewing at me remind me of some conceited cockhead. Instead of flexing his broad mindness and big heart all he did was flex his financial wealth. When I think back I feel even more stupid for being so blind. What did I see in stella. Was my eyes this rotten. I’m more angry because I just took all this in and acted so pathetic . But the pain of betrayal and hurt and accepting that she moved on was really happening. Yes I know I was basically asking for a beating. But I was so shocked and hurt she could do this to me and humiliate me.

Eventually later All my close online friends which I made through the years I  contacted them who are also older than me by a couple of years and some are couples listened to my story and heard me out as I went to seek for advice. They were not too surprised because they could see signs early on when I first told them about stella and how she hated games and tried to make me change. They teased me about it how I was “whipped” but I took it as a joke and always ignored it. But I realise now after my mind slowly cleared if you love someone you don’t change them. Since gaming was a big part of my life and my hobby. Unless for health reasons than okay I would understand why you should change but this wasn’t the reason. They shared their stories and life experiences with me about love and told me it wasn’t my fault,  similar  to what my parents said  and what real love should be like. I knew what they said was right but my heart was finding it hard to let go of this betrayal. Love turned into hate and then vice versa. It was a constant tug of war inside my heart everyday. Because I truly loved stella and I never ever thought of the notion what if things didn’t work out. A life without her. I realised I loved her more than I loved  myself. Loved her so much I betrayed myself. By then it was two more weeks until stellas birthday. Her birthday was on the 22 December , nearly Christmas . I had long ago prepared her a specially hand made box I had made for her months ago to surprise her again when we reunited. I ended up dropping it at her house and I saw a another car which wasn’t her families . Parked inside. I could hear laughter and joy and her voice inside as I dropped off my gift. Instinct told me and  I knew it was the guy she was seeing and I met all her family once before when we were bestfriends. The pain seared into my heart so much. Because all these years she never let me into her house and see her family. And spend the birthday together with them together. We always had to sneak out to celebrate with our time together . I went back home sad and depressed. For those two weeks I had constant nightmares. I woke up with a few hours sleep and my entire back and head was drenched in sweat. Everytime I woke up I had constant chest pain.it was like a Boulder was on my chest. I eventually realised two days after her birthday wait. I think I could find out who this new guy is. If I log onto her social media account. And all along I had Slight hope that we could still end up together. But this all ended once I logged into her account .Mind you we exchanged our social media accounts on facebook before. She gave me hers and I gave her mine but she eventually changed her password and I stopped looking because I always trusted her all long. We only exchanged because she was always insecure about me all the time. But I didn’t mind. And remmber I did all her assignments and she used only one password for everything. So I went on. And I discovered everything. I found out everything. I realised no wonder why she didn’t tel me. Why didn’t have the decency to explain herself or atleast given the nature of our relationship and the amount of time and promises we had together let me clear everything in order to help me move on. She must have felt ashamed and guilty to tell me. As her bestfriend who willingly chose to stand by her for 10years when others entered and exited her life. I willingly chose to stay because  I truly cared. I knew all her friends that’s why I found it so shocking to see who the heck is this guy I don’t even know his name all I saw was his initials she posted one day on her Instagram with letters . K.T #sweetdarlingboy

I read their chat and how they met . I read their messages together. I read what she wrote and she even mentioned me in it. She painted me as a joke. She twisted the truth and made me seem like a heinous criminal, that I was just a chapter, she felt pity for me and was only there for me to change me and saying she felt so proud of it that she left me a better person when when she met me. That she was only their for me for a time. She played the innocent victim that she could do no wrong. She uttered those sweet words of love. The very same ones she used on me. But she went the extra mile said the words I always wanted to hear her say to me. But I never got it. and It was only one month after the break up between me and stella . 31st October 2018. And this K.T slid into her dms and basically they hit it off. This was the second shock of my life and by far the worst one. After reading everything after seeing proof with my own very eyes. The girl I waited a decade for. The girl I gave my heart my soul my life for. The girl I loved to death. I realised I was replaceable. “ she always told me she wanted real love “ she wanted someone to prove to her. When I look back. I realise I proved to her. Look at me I willing stood by you for a decade . There for were more suitable girls I met in my life but I chose stella and stuck by her. But look at our conclusions. She broke the thread of love. Our destiny and fate together. It was suppose to be a beautiful love story of two highschool sweet hearts. Idk what the right words to describe how I felt. But my first shock of pain after when I went over her house couldn’t compare to this one. My mind literally snapped . I felt the snapping sensation within my mind. Then my heart I finally understood the meaning and the saying when your heart slowly turns black. 🖤Black with hate . Black with anger. Dripping in black. My mind blurring into darkness, my world fading into black. All that I felt  was waves of pain. Of sorrow or grief. Of suffering. All because I was blinded by love.  I wanted to destroy the computer screen that was in front of my eyes. I wanted to somehow deny what I was seeing. But it was piercing into my eyes it was piercing into my very soul. I clenched my first so hard . If I didn’t cut my nails recently I would have ripped into my flesh because I was so filled with pain and hate. After a while of just trembling and trying to contain myself from doi anything stupid. I just burst out in tears again. I thought my tears had dried after crying for 2 weeks . But it came like an unending stream again. Once again my family rushed in and asked me what happened. I told them I finally know why she didn’t tell me. Why she didn’t give me an answer. 

Now it leads up to the current date.  Year 2020. A decade since I met her. I can’t forget the memories. I’m slowly adjusting.my mind process and I’m fully aware and I understand it’s not my fault. But the pain won’t go away. It won’t subside. My mind tells me it’s okay. It’s not my fault . But my heart can’t forget the betrayal. Now I find it hard. I’m afraid of love. I feel like idk if I will be able to find love again. Even if I do. What if the next person is like stella. I was already a very sceptical and pessimistic person to begin with because I didn’t trust people much. When stella entered my life I went from heaven which turned into hell. I was already weary enough but now it Is 100x worse. My walls around my heart are so much thicker. Idk if I can take another betrayal. I’m fully aware of my mistakes now. But the pain lingers and the heart remembers. 

I realise I got played. And she always told me she didn’t play games. She played with my heart really well. Jokes on me I guess . Had she just privately talked to me one on one and cleared everything given me the opportunity to talk to her. Had the decency to and heart to let me say my sort and end things happily and peacefully I could move on. I would have preferred. I didn’t realise how blind I was and how thicc in the head I was. We could have cleanly broken up with  respect considering everything that’s happened between us and all our memories and years together I could have accepted this break up. 

Sorry for the long story. I feel so much better letting it out of my chest.

(First paragraph is relevant to story later, as it explains how  we first met)
I am currently 23years old. My story begins from high school 10 years ago. A decade ago when I was in high school I was minding my own business when this transfer girl came into my class. Let’s nickname her Stella for privacy reasons. I met my bestfriend due to the fact that when she instantly saw me she had the urge to get close to me. As the distrustful and highly sceptical guy I was due to my upbringing coming from a dysfunctional family where I didn’t receive much love and care growing up. I was very confused and sceptical of one day a girl who I didn’t know or was attracted (not saying she was ugly ,she  was pretty but I just felt nothing for her) to in any way suddenly wanting to be my bestfriend and coming to talk to me. For weeks she kept trying to talk to me during lunch and recess. Eventually we got closer and we would hang out everyday. I was still sceptical about the bestfriend part but I eventually throughout the years I accepted it and she really became my bestfriend in my heart. She obviously didn’t like me in a romantic way I think. Or maybe I was just thicc in the head and didn’t realise it so I never made a move on her because at the time I had my own problems at home and it was constantly on my mind and al the stuff teenagers went through. But Stella lit a spark within my heart. Which I didn’t realise at the time. But one thing for sure was that she made me feel special. Wanted. Loved and someone who accepted me and wanted to be my friend. Which really made me happy. Of course even though we had the bestfriend stigma and talked about never things we never actually went too deeply into ur own personally lives. It was always about general topics about everything.  I never went into my family life details because that was something highly personal as Of course she dated guys in school and she dated this one guy who was popular and was my friend back when we were in primary but after always seeing me and Stella so close he got really jealous. As her bestfriend I would comfort her listen to her and be their for her whenever she needed. I stood up for her many times to the other guys because as her first ex Clinton was popular he loved telling all his friends about their relationship and they had many problems and struggles. I stood by her obviously as the bestfriend when people talked shit about her or asked me about her. Even though sometimes we had an off and off relationships because I didn’t want to go in between her relationship as she told me that Clinton was jealous that stella was close with me. I perfectly understood the reasoning as a guy. I didn’t want to make her life difficult. However a Few times stella was kinda cruel to me in a way. Where we made plans to see a movie but she would leave me hanging the last minute. One time we were suppose to see a movie that night together that I really wanted to see . But she suddenly changed. I didn’t know why at that time but accepted it. So I asked my family to go with me. And low and behold whilst going to buy the tickets I see her and clinton going to see the same movie . I walked straight in ignoring her knowing that she saw me with a stone face and she had the face of “oh shit I got caught face” (i was raging inside). Because I would have understood if she just told me the truth. I would be perfectly be fine with it, but she didn’t. The next couple weeks was spent me ignoring her at school. But eventually We started talking again because I missed her. Another time when she was dating another guy because clinton her first boyfriend and her were having a spat and they broke up and we’re seeing other people I think she dated this guy roger and she told me one time she wanted to try being with a more older and mature guy also Personally I saw it as her trying to get back at clinton for dating someone else whilst they were fighting previously even though she never admitted it. One day I was invited along one day because I thought she wanted to hang out with me at the beach with her friends. In the end I got turned into a third wheel and most of the time I was alone hanging by myself . I was basically a spectator playing with sand by myself. To see them all lovey dovey and she basically ignored me nearly the entire time until one of her friends mentioned to her. I feel sorry for your bestfriend why did you invite him if you are just going to leave him alone. Mind you This was the first time she introduced me to this new boyfriend and I wasn’t really close to her friends. Okay let’s Let’s fast forward to me and Stella. High school ended. We didn’t have a proper goodbye to each other. One year later down the road of no contact and me and her not knowing what happened to each other. I finally realised in my heart that I missed her more than just a bestfriend and finally got the courage to confess to her. I didn’t know if she was still dating the roger . But I had to confess either way or I wouldn’t forgive myself and be at piece I had to let her know. Because I couldn’t contain that tiny spark which turned into a raging fireball. I chose her birthday which was  in a few days and I got her a gift and went to see her. We rekindled our friendship I confessed.she was shocked that I would like her she expected me to find someone better. I told her I loved her I enjoyed her company that you made me happy and feel special. That’s all that mattered. I courted her for three days and she rejected me 47 times before finally saying “yes” I was really determined. To be with her. 3 years passed by. I was so totally in love with her to the point it was blind faith and blind love. We had many disputes due to the fact that our hobbies where completely opposite . (Keep in mind this was my first relationship. Yes I was a virgin. I am inexperienced in love but I knew what real love was. As someone who craves for love who didn’t receive love growing up I knew what I wanted. Stella was obviously experienced hence the story arc on top paragraph, and she had two prior relationships before me,which later she told me was very abusive and the second guy roger beat her and forced her into having sex, this happened after we broke off after high school , and I was shocked and angry this happened when I found out). I knew she lost her virginity to Clinton since highschool already. Even so I loved her truly and I accepted everything. She was hurt to the point that when she was telling me about it she was literally shaking. But I didn’t care. I wanted to be with her. And told her I love you for who you are and accept you no matter what). Eventually after one month I loss my virginity to her and she was shaking before we did the deed. I did my best to be gentle and before we did it I looked into her eyes and asked her “do you trust me” and kissed her forehead . But she believed in me that time and trusted me. I’m only saying this because personally to me. Nowadays if  a guy sleeps with a girl he’s seen as a hero yet when girls sleep with guys they are seen as a h0es. Call me old fashioned but sex and kissing was really special to me and I wanted to give it to the person I loved which was stella.  I loved anime/games/drawing/ dancing. She liked keeping in touch with all the social media/ vintage and she was really insecure about anime due to the fact clinton her first ex also liked anime but he use to collect all the perverted merchandise for example mouse pads with a picture of a big Boob chick that supports your wrist. I told her I loved anime for the amazing way it always delivered different perspective in a Creative and imaginative way. But she never wanted to give it a try. We did have things in common like we were Buddhist and shared same values about life. And that we had the bestfriend relationship thing going and we’re comfortable sharing things with each other. We were comfortable . I called her lotus because she was into Buddhism so much she always projected herself as a pure white lotus and she called me light because I was that bright light in her life. Eventually our values and beliefs  clashed and it turned into fights. I made mistakes . But they were never severe . Example Playing video games with girls but never flirting or crossing the line ofc just she didn’t like the fact I played games with them. I promised I wouldn’t play anymore because I wanted I make her happy. I tried for a while but  I sometimes couldn’t keep it. As gaming was something I really enjoyed . She wasn’t a gamer herself she hated it. She held it against me all these years always reminded me how I was a liar, kept calling me a cheater. Mind you she also broke promises to me as well, but I always forgave her and they were actually more severe than mine but I always ended up forgiving her. I told her my family problems and she used that as an attack on my character. She tormented me with it all these years. Something I couldn’t change. It was really hurtful and harming to my self esteem.  Throughout the entire relationship she kept comparing me to her ex’s and saying they made her happier. She compared me to social media couples online or her family. Mind you I was never rich and I told her since the very beginning of our relationship. She told me she knows and didn’t mind she loved me either way. I couldn’t spoil you like the people you see on Instagram living the luxuary life . I did everything I could for her to make her comfortable as I could and feel loved and special just like any man would for the person they love. Since I couldn’t always afford fancy gifts and present I made most of the things I gave her by hand and spent nights and hours doing it.even skipping my gaming sessions and hobbies with my friends because she was more important to me. She tried to change me in a lot of things to fit her ideal version of the man she wanted But I realised after everything  if she really loved me and accepted me she wouldn’t change me but bring out the best in me. But as the love blind fool that I was. Even though she hurt me . I always tried to see the best in her no matter what. Of course I got hurt and yelled back when she hurt me with all those words and actions she did. But it was never as bad as the way she abused me. She made me feel low about myself I felt miserable . But I always cheered myself up because I was like “ as long as she’s happy”  then I was happy. She made me feel like I didn’t deserve her. Constantly reminded me how much better she was and how all these rich guys ask her but she declines them all. Because they don’t know Buddhism and understand about life that you shouldn’t be material.  I remmber once I told her I would get her a MacBook Pro, Cost  $3000 . I worked on my summer job for my uncle for 2 months straight . To save up for it. But I had school fees next year, which costed $500 . I told her  sorry I couldn’t get you MacBook like I said because I told her I had fees to pay  but I bought you the next best thing a $2500 zen book. She gave me an ugly frown and she wasn’t pleased. Then she acted like nothing was wrong.but that first reaction she showed for 5secs forever stuck inside my head.  And had always weighed on my mind . Another time I was thinking of getting her a GoPro as a gift so we could take pictures together . Instead I bought her a $1000 sony camera that was on sale, her first reaction and words to me where “is it more expensive than the GoPro” I told her yes it is, and her smile beamed up and she was happy. She liked to say I suit and look better with guys who are bigger. Your too skinny and not that tall. Eat up. Most important when we fought. She never thought she was wrong about the things she said. She “said to me I never wrong” one day she even said to me. “ money solves all my problems, I’ll be your slave for a few more years. But then I’ll leave” I thought those were just angry words that time because we talked about it later. And she didn’t apologise but she calmed down and I I let it go. Because I was a love blind fool. She didn’t make it into university after high school because of all the relationships troubles where was having ( refer back to paragraph one) but  I supported her believed in her and encouraged her the entire way. I even did her work / essays and assignments for her. Eventually she made it into her university  undertaking 5/12 primary school education so she could become a teacher. I ended up doing 90% of ever assignment for her for the entire 3 years of her bachelor degree . Till she graduated . She didn’t even let me attend and take photos with her on that day. The only things I couldn’t do was sit her final exam but I spent hours making notes from her lectures and helping her memorise and learn it before her exam. Time I willingly sacrificed and wasted , because I thought of her as my only one and wife.who I would marry , grow old and die with hand in hand. Keep in mind I also didn’t make it into university after high school , I went tafe, struggled and failed. Kept trying  and eventually got into my chosen field of medical science at a good university . I don’t come from a rich family , Stella came from a above average family , as her father who’s rally a good man owns a mechanic shop and since young , didn’t let his wife(stellas mum) work and made her stay at home. Whilst he worked 7 days for many over 30years. So she had a role model that she wanted someone like her father and expected me to treat her like a princess . Because my dumbass didn’t know better and I truly loved her and wanted to treat her like a princess I didn’t mind. I did my best to live up to her expectations and studied my ass off. So I could make the big bucks one day and show her family I deserved her and support her because she drilled into my head that I was lesser. That I was lucky to have her. . Even though I’m not one of this naturally gifted people . I was pretty average I just worked harder to get to where I was. But I always fell short from those students who had a better foundation than me. As I wasn’t wealthy to hire tutors since a young age or get the best teachers. Throughout the relationship she would never allow me into her family gatherings or join her family for dinner or any sort. When we went out together she wouldn’t show affection or allow me to hold her hand or touch her in public around the place we lived. We always had to travel atleast an hour away before we could display our relationship. She didn’t tell her friends. One time she said to people when they asked our relationship were , only just bestfriends. It hurt me really bad. But in the end she always had a way of her words. She was very sweet. Too sweet. She knew the right words to say. The right buttons to press and had me wrapped around her thumb. I loved her so much I fell into her net. I trusted her with my life. And never believed she would betray me or harm me. Eventually after all the argument and discontentment that had build up over the years. The red flags and signs finally built up and my brain finally overpowered my heart for once which was the one taking control of myself this entire time. I told her . The problems within my family got worse and worse and I told her about it but she didn’t seem to be paying attention or caring much. I said to her after a movie one day Look I want to focus on my life now I can’t help you do your work because I’m struggling with studies and my situation at home. I always shared everything with her the good and the bad I didn’t hide it. and I want to study properly and it’s getting harder, I love you and I need to focus so I can get a good job and support you in the future. You’ll have to complete your masters degree yourself. And then She flipped. She brought up all the past mistakes . Made it such a big deal as if I cheated on her and banged another girl. Eventually we ended up arguing out of anger we broke up. We have been doing this thing on and off for the last three years of the relationship only difference was that as each time we did it ignoring each other got longer and longer. And it was always me coming back to her because I missed her so much. I didn’t care even though I was right . I wanted to see her and be with her. My love for her was more important than my ego or pride or always wanting to be right like stella felt.  And we always got back together. Even though we ended up fighting again later.  So one year later. I fix my problems at home. I fix my shit together  and I’m ready to begin again with her. I tried to contact her during the one year break we had between us in 2019 it’s nearing her birthday near Christmas I was going to finally restart anew with her and make her finally want to see my family. Afterall she kept giving excuses to meet my family and wouldn’t let me see her family all these years. I accepted it all. I texted her first. Butterflies was in my stomach I was happy I was excited it was the feeling as if I was falling in love with her all over again I could finally see her again. All the promises of never giving up on each other. The countless times and nights and hours we spent talking about our future life. Travelling marrying . Being there for one another. Never giving up. She told me that “I’ll be her last guy, if she doesn’t end up with me she’ll shave her head and be a monk” we promised countless times to never let go. You were the only one she said. 

Then .... She tells me “I’m with someone else,he found me, it wasn’t intentional”  then she starts saying he’s a better man than you. That she doesn’t trust me. That I’m a liar a cheater. I was shocked I was like what. This entire year I didn’t see anyone else. I never talked  for another girl. I didn’t even play any video games because I was getting my life back together. Everytime when I wanted to give up I remembered stella and our future together and it helped me power through the day. Countless times throughout that year apart when I was about to fall I woul stand right back up. I was shocked to read what she said . I thought she was joking just to get back at me because during our years she would go to some pretty petty and  extreme lengths to hurt me and make me  crazy or jealous . One time she made a fake Instagram account and googled a picture of a good looking dude and pretended to text herself and print screen the chat to me that she was seeing someone else. I thought this time was the same. So I was in denial. I was hurt again. But I didn’t believe it. I started messaging her. Asking her “stop it , I wanna see you , let’s start over I’ve handled all my problems I’m ready to create more memories with you and we can continue where we left off” eventually she told me to come to her house and talk after a few more days of me pestering her because I believed she was just throwing one of her tantrums again for me leaving her too long. She let me time into her house and her mum was nearby she had that kind of expression when she saw me like she was looking at her most hated enemy that I was worthless in her eyes. When I came in my mind was clouded as many thoughts were going through my head at once. But deep down I was going maybe it’s a prank or a joke. This can’t be real. We’ve been through so much. I’ve loved her for 10years we’ve been through so much. Our promises. Words and vows to each other. Countless nights and memories I showed her I was here for her and loved her.  She sat me down but left a space between me and her and clearly said to me “ it’s over”, I’m seeing someone else I don’t want to see you ever again. I don’t love you.  I’ve got a new bestfriend he’s so much better than you “She didn’t give me a chance to talk and only only said her part and called me “selfish”And when I tried to talk “why? And ask her what about all the promises. She wouldn’t even hear it. Her mum came and also attacked me and said “the past is the past “ she didn’t want to give me an explanation of her betraying and abandoning me. Why did she move on? . I was so overwhelmingly hurt and shocked no words were coming out of my mouth. My mind short circuited. My heart wanted to explode out of pain and grief and sadness. The memories of our 10years went flashing before my eyes. Her words of love. Loyalty and forever being faithful and real love were flashing across my mind. It was an overwhelming experience. I was so shocked even their was a delay in my tears as they didn’t  come out until I exited their house and went I shakily walked back into my car. Words of desperation came out of my mouth that time. “ can we still be friends, will I ever see you again” and she shut me down. She and her mum attacked me over my mistakes over the past. And how I got angry and said mean things those times and that didn’t you break up a year ago. But all along. Stellas mum knew I did her daughters assignments. She said she didn’t approve of me officially but she let her daughter see me all those years and we were more than bestfriends . As Stella tells her mum everything. I did get mad at times after being hurt by Stella’s words and I was immature about it . I confess throughout the relationship but I never attacked her first they were always words of anger because she hurt my feelings all along when I was just trying my best for her but she didn’t understand me . And she twisted it around as an attack on me . When she knew it was always her daughter stella instigating the attacks on me. Putting me down humiliating me and insulting me. I was speechless. I took it all. Because I was under so much shock. My first experience of mental shock in my life where nothing made sense to me anymore. The pain was OVERWHELMING. Once I went back to my car I broke like a dam. Tears came rushing down like a waterfall and I screamed and cried outside her house inside my car like I never cried before. Eventually I managed to get back home in one piece. And I my family noticed that something was wrong. Because I had the expression of a walking corpse. I told them leave me alone I needed time. They didn’t ask . And left me alone. Because they knew once I was ready I would come and talk to them. Despite my family problems my parents were atleast understanding in some way. Despite having their own issues which I do not wish to discuss. I sat on my bed listless like a zombie . Couldn’t eat couldn’t sleep. I only had 1 hour sleep all day. In the morning I would walk up and down my room like a crazy person. Thinking and thinking. 10years of memories flashing in  my eyes. Every words. Every action. Every smile. Every laughter. Every tear. Every cry was slowly winding inside my mind. All the things we stayed up and talked about. The moments we made love. Her smell. Her face . Her laugh. Trying to process everything where did I go wrong. Is this my fault. Why did she do this. What is happening. It’s nearly a week and the pain only keeps growing. This continued on for about a week . I felt a tight pressure in my heart and it wouldn’t go away . It’s like someone was pushing Down on on my tiny heart and it was hard to Breathe. (I realised now later it was anxiety and if it continued my heart was about to burst from pressure as I close to having a heartattack and I could have died). For 7 days I only had 1-2 hours sleep as I was up all night drowning in sadness. Drowning in nightmares. Only fell asleep due to exhaustion. I drank water only to stay alive. I loss a lot of weight. I drank alcohol one night after abstaining from it for 3 years because stella didn’t like me drinking and i was only a casual drinker as I only drank in social events but she forbidded me from drinking it saying it was for my health and that her dad barely drinks. I thought it could numb the pain of t sorrow. That was totally wrong a bad move on my part. I took the strongest alcohol I had. It didn’t make me drunk just made me incredible emotionally more unstable and I couldn’t hold back my tears anymore. it just amplified the pain i was holding in and I burst out crying so loudly. My family couldn’t wait anymore and they rushed in and Made me spit it out. What was wrong. I told them everything about what happened with me and stella. I knew they were deeply hurt and angry. But they didn’t show it because they knew they had to calm me down first because I was at the point of collapsing. I swear in my entire life I have never felt so much suffering and pain . I never felt such overbearing overwhelming and desolate pain ever. And it still lingers within my memories and on my mind and heart today. It’s a like a shadow that follows me everywhere. I can’t shake it off. They comforted and explained me that I didn’t do anything wrong. It wasn’t my fault. They were upset at me I could see but held it in because all these years as I was dating stella I told my parents how good she was how she was Awsome. My parents from the very start didn’t like stella because my parents are the opposite of me. I’m quiet and an introvert my parents were always social and outgoing and have a lot of people experience. They know through life how to judge people. Throughout the years as my parents they noticed how me and stella fought through the phone and words we exchanged when we wee both angry. How she hurt me what she said. And my mum especially told me how she didn’t like her. She saw me always doing her assignments.  She knew I was head over heels for her and that this was my first love. She couldn’t stop me anymore because she said it was too late even. Your in too deep. Always stopping my hobbies and even studies to go to her and help her in whatever she needed, was like her personal butler and taxi. My mum told me before She isn’t the right one for you . But I didn’t listen. My rose tinted lenses were super freaking HUGE(loveblind) I didn’t listen to my parents warnings. They told me through the years a few times and we got into arguments over it. And it only hurt me worse. Because I realised how right they were all along after talking to me what real love was about and how if she really loved you she wouldn’t have shouldn’t have done this. That I shouldn’t have let her get away with it. I should have walked away. But they said to me at the end they were so glad. So glad things ended. You gained experience. You know know what a real woman should be like. The right woman. That it’s okay your a man . You have nothing to lose. Your still young and only 23. Their are so many other fishes in the sea. How can you say she is the one when there are 7 billion people on this earth. What’s the chance of that one being right next to you on the first go. None of my family liked stella even my sister said so but they stopped saying much after how much I defended her over the years and always bit back  at them if they said anything bad about her.  I was really an idiot.It only made the pain worse in my heart because I realised I was an idiot. I was a dumbass. There’s no greater fool than me on this planet. I wanted to ram my head against the concrete and end my life. I felt so ashamed so stupid. So low. I eventually ended telling some close friends I made online through the gaming world since as an introvert I didn’t really have many friends in real life. Because they didn’t really treat me as a good friend from high school  so I didn’t mind losing them.  Back then all I thought I needed was stella as she was my bestfriend and also my girlfriend who I treated like my real wife. I didn’t think I needed anyone else. I eventually called her one night because I was still in denial , just so happened she was with her new bestfriend/boyfriend. She said basically humiliated me and said “he’s a better man than you” and passed the phone to him. I realise later I was so stupid. And desperate but that’s all I was feeling at the time because I found it so hard to digest the reality of my situation. My world was crumbling. The funny thing was . The guy kept saying and flexing his business and acting cocky like a prick. Saying “I’m stable and got a business” I’m a better man than you ever were. The dumbass I was I was hurt . When I think back I’m so angry at myself for not saying anything and taking all this bullshit. I cant believe stella who always said to me that she was never into materialistic things and Buddhism. That’s who she projects herself to be. Because she liked to played  the victim. Would say this guy is better than me. Yet the words he’s spewing at me remind me of some conceited cockhead. Instead of flexing his broad mindness and big heart all he did was flex his financial wealth. When I think back I feel even more stupid for being so blind. What did I see in stella. Was my eyes this rotten. I’m more angry because I just took all this in and acted so pathetic . But the pain of betrayal and hurt and accepting that she moved on was really happening. Yes I know I was basically asking for a beating. But I was so shocked and hurt she could do this to me and humiliate me. Eventually later All my close online friends which I made through the years I  contacted them who are also older than me by a couple of years and some are couples listened to my story and heard me out as I went to seek for advice. They were not too surprised because they could see signs early on when I first told them about stella and how she hated games and tried to make me change. They teased me about it how I was “whipped” but I took it as a joke and always ignored it. But I realise now after my mind slowly cleared if you love someone you don’t change them. Since gaming was a big part of my life and my hobby. Unless for health reasons than okay I would understand why you should change but this wasn’t the reason. They shared their stories and life experiences with me about love and told me it wasn’t my fault,  similar  to what my parents said  and what real love should be like. I knew what they said was right but my heart was finding it hard to let go of this betrayal. Love turned into hate and then vice versa. It was a constant tug of war inside my heart everyday. Because I truly loved stella and I never ever thought of the notion what if things didn’t work out. A life without her. I realised I loved her more than I loved  myself. Loved her so much I betrayed myself. By then it was two more weeks until stellas birthday. Her birthday was on the 22 December , nearly Christmas . I had long ago prepared her a specially hand made box I had made for her months ago to surprise her again when we reunited. I ended up dropping it at her house and I saw a another car which wasn’t her families . Parked inside. I could hear laughter and joy and her voice inside as I dropped off my gift. Instinct told me and  I knew it was the guy she was seeing and I met all her family once before when we were bestfriends. The pain seared into my heart so much. Because all these years she never let me into her house and see her family. And spend the birthday together with them together. We always had to sneak out to celebrate with our time together . I went back home sad and depressed. For those two weeks I had constant nightmares. I woke up with a few hours sleep and my entire back and head was drenched in sweat. Everytime I woke up I had constant chest pain.it was like a Boulder was on my chest. I eventually realised two days after her birthday wait. I think I could find out who this new guy is. If I log onto her social media account. And all along I had Slight hope that we could still end up together. But this all ended once I logged into her account .Mind you we exchanged our social media accounts on facebook before. She gave me hers and I gave her mine but she eventually changed her password and I stopped looking because I always trusted her all long. We only exchanged because she was always insecure about me all the time. But I didn’t mind. And remmber I did all her assignments and she used only one password for everything. So I went on. And I discovered everything. I found out everything. I realised no wonder why she didn’t tel me. Why didn’t have the decency to explain herself or atleast given the nature of our relationship and the amount of time and promises we had together let me clear everything in order to help me move on. She must have felt ashamed and guilty to tell me. As her bestfriend who willingly chose to stand by her for 10years when others entered and exited her life. I willingly chose to stay because  I truly cared. I knew all her friends that’s why I found it so shocking to see who the heck is this guy I don’t even know his name all I saw was his initials she posted one day on her Instagram with letters . K.T #sweetdarlingboy. I read their chat and how they met . I read their messages together. I read what she wrote and she even mentioned me in it. She painted me as a joke. She twisted the truth and made me seem like a heinous criminal, that I was just a chapter, she felt pity for me and was only there for me to change me and saying she felt so proud of it that she left me a better person when when she met me. That she was only their for me for a time. She played the innocent victim that she could do no wrong. She uttered those sweet words of love. The very same ones she used on me. But she went the extra mile said the words I always wanted to hear her say to me. But I never got it. and It was only one month after the break up between me and stella . 31st October 2018. And this K.T slid into her dms and basically they hit it off. This was the second shock of my life and by far the worst one. After reading everything after seeing proof with my own very eyes. The girl I waited a decade for. The girl I gave my heart my soul my life for. The girl I loved to death. I realised I was replaceable. “ she always told me she wanted real love “ she wanted someone to prove to her. When I look back. I realise I proved to her. Look at me I willing stood by you for a decade . There for were more suitable girls I met in my life but I chose stella and stuck by her. But look at our conclusions. She broke the thread of love. Our destiny and fate together. It was suppose to be a beautiful love story of two highschool sweet hearts. Idk what the right words to describe how I felt. But my first shock of pain after when I went over her house couldn’t compare to this one. My mind literally snapped . I felt the snapping sensation within my mind. Then my heart I finally understood the meaning and the saying when your heart slowly turns black. 🖤Black with hate . Black with anger. Dripping in black. My mind blurring into darkness, my world fading into black. All that I felt  was waves of pain. Of sorrow or grief. Of suffering. All because I was blinded by love.  I wanted to destroy the computer screen that was in front of my eyes. I wanted to somehow deny what I was seeing. But it was piercing into my eyes it was piercing into my very soul. I clenched my first so hard . If I didn’t cut my nails recently I would have ripped into my flesh because I was so filled with pain and hate. After a while of just trembling and trying to contain myself from doi anything stupid. I just burst out in tears again. I thought my tears had dried after crying for 2 weeks . But it came like an unending stream again. Once again my family rushed in and asked me what happened. I told them I finally know why she didn’t tell me. Why she didn’t give me an answer. Now it leads up to the current date.  Year 2020. A decade since I met her. I can’t forget the memories. I’m slowly adjusting.my mind process and I’m fully aware and I understand it’s not my fault. But the pain won’t go away. It won’t subside. My mind tells me it’s okay. It’s not my fault . But my heart can’t forget the betrayal. Now I find it hard. I’m afraid of love. I feel like idk if I will be able to find love again. Even if I do. What if the next person is like stella. I was already a very sceptical and pessimistic person to begin with because I didn’t trust people much. When stella entered my life I went from heaven which turned into hell. I was already weary enough but now it Is 100x worse. My walls around my heart are so much thicker. Idk if I can take another betrayal. I’m fully aware of my mistakes now. But the pain lingers and the heart remembers. I realise I got played. And she always told me she didn’t play games. She played with my heart really well. Jokes on me I guess . Had she just privately talked to me one on one and cleared everything given me the opportunity to talk to her. Had the decency to and heart to let me say my sort and end things happily and peacefully I could move on. I would have preferred. I didn’t realise how blind I was and how thicc in the head I was. We could have cleanly broken up with  respect considering everything that’s happened between us and all our memories and years together I could have accepted this break up.

Dear WMO/Reddit/Internet/World,

I could very much do with your help right now.

See, I'm about to do the hardest thing in my life...
To put the happy ending to this story, I am putting the fate of my future in your hands...


Last year, something amazing happened, after my girlfriend of 9 years broke up with me...I fell in love with this Canadian girl.

Only, if only the story could be as simple as in...daily life?

Truth be told, it's much much much more complicated than it usually is.

TL;DR:

- I met the girl of my dreams

- I asked her to marry me, and she said yes!

- she lives in Vancouver, with her 2 boys.

- she is financially dependent on and living in with her abusive ex

- I want to move, but I need a job...

- which is considering the Vancouver job market, the hardest part!

- I've worked as an ICT Consultant in the Network/Security, with Linux/*nix and programming experience.

- I'm available straight away, aside from the immigration process

- I would really like your help!-


Here's the FULL story:

I'm a Dutch guy; just turned 33 2 weeks ago; I finally got diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome last year; had a burn-out partly because of that; I saw my relationship of 9 years broken up in the latter part of last year as well, and later parted with my employer due to the fact that I was about to explore a possible future in Canada.

Then due to some weird twist of fate, through a mutual friend, I got in touch with this Canadian girl! We just connected, on a personal level, no intentions. One part because I wasn't looking for a relationship as I had just come out of one, the other part because she was in a relationship, a bad one but still. We just enjoyed talking to each other and sharing insights into the other genders' minds! Nothing more!

Until we suddenly found ourselves having the night and all the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fall into place! It was like getting back together with that ex of years ago, which just did not work at the time but it sure did now! Only without the previous history...

This was such a paradox to us! This just couldn't be! But... it was perfect! And while we were fighting this - I mean, this could not just be! The distance! Nearly 5000 miles between us! - we just saw ourselves getting back to each other, no matter how hard it got...sleepless nights were had... Yet, still!

As her relationship was going from bad to worse, we were talking on Facebook, then taking up other methods, going to Skype calls as her health didn't permit her to work at the time, then Skype calls to her cell as she was out looking for a job, sending messages to each other to wake up to, etc. We also knew that we needed to meet, as impossible as this was.

Over the course of December, things got so bad that she saw no other solution then to break up with her then boyfriend.

There's plenty I could say about him, but I won't and it's not important... Let's just say that things between them were apparently just not destined to be?

The only thing is...and this is where the plot thickens... She has 2 kids and as she had moved out from Ontario to Vancouver, BC together with her ex and had been in bad health, she had no real financial means to get out; she saw herself forced to stay where she was while applying for jobs. Considering the Vancouver job market, she was was not that fortunate.

It was around this time that the first mention came of a party in Toronto, at the end of March; knowing that she felt the obligation to give it at least one more try and we had agreed that we would give it until the end of March. I knew right there and then that this needed to happen, I needed to make this happen.

Then, over NYE, I had a weekend with friends, so, considering I DJ as a hobby, I planned on making her a mix, which ended up being two mixes, a double, in her favourite genre. (Happy Hardcore for the curious.) Because of my background, I've always been a sucker for naming, so I needed to name it something with big relevance. I named it Perfect Paradox, one mix being in a minor key, called Dusk, the other called Dawn, in upper key. Dusk, for the sadness of the cold of the evening, Dawn for the uplifting vibe of the morning setting in, but also for the moments we shared as the time difference meant that she went to bed as I got up.

On NYE however...Things had escalated again, where her ex managed to push some buttons, making her spiral into this negative stream of thoughts...to a point where she confessed to me that she was writing a suicide note and threatened that if I called the police or anything that she would immediately take the pills she had in front of her; having tried to commit suicide quite early in my life, I knew the mindset. I managed to convince her that this was not the solution, and after I found myself dropping the L-word a week before... I knew that I needed this girl in my life, permanently, and I did the best and stupidest thing ever: I asked her to marry me - and she said yes! Even if this meant that I had to endure beef for this, because my ex was around during that weekend.

And we kept on ""dancing"" from then on, because she had her responsibilities to mind; even though things kept on escalating between her and her ex.

Over time, this ended up being a pattern, where, due to the fact that he was a freelancer, they got into a pattern where - because they had little money - he had become more and more abusive towards her... leading up to a few massive fights between them and no matter how frustrating this was... I kept my distance, because I knew one thing... She was something I had never imagined to be possible, a statistical anomaly at best; I found my one. More importantly, due to the pattern of abuse and the fact that she was stuck in this pattern, I had to get her out of there, to give her something important, perspective.

As this progressed, January turned into February and I had a weekend in London, and because of the massive snow fall this led to disrupted communication, as I had somewhat become her line of stability. Yet, I was not about to give up on her! Pulling an all-nighter, camping at Starbucks for free wifi and food and drinks; but I had become more determined than ever! Despite what she said, I saw the person she really was, piercing through that façade, time after time. This needed to happen. I needed to make this happen.

And as Valentine's day was approaching quickly the week after, it had every appearance that her ex was about to leave to ""the Motherland"" to get work and because she wanted to look for a job, I offered to fly in. I had managed to pull it off with work to take 2 weeks off as I had told them about the situation and got booking, until her ex decided to forfeit the flight and stay...just after I had booked. He had effectively thrown away 800 Canadian dollars to do...more of the same basically, which wasn't a whole lot. Luckily for me, KLM was nice enough to reimburse me the full costs and planning continued.

The party I mentioned earlier, was a party in Toronto; called Heart of Gold, where, more importantly, her favourite DJ was playing: Darren Styles; producer of a track by the same name as the party. I'll get back on the significance of this later. 

Yes, I definitely had a bit of a WTF moment at that time; imagine doing something crazy like that?! Because not only was I about to fly in myself, but due to his persistence in believing in this situation I needed to fly her out as well... Quite the picture!

In the mean time, things got to an all-time low on her end, where they basically could not afford the rent or food; going against better judgement I guess, but making the decision with a conscious mind, I lend them 2000 CAD. On the premise that, as he had a job offer and was getting his Work Permit, they would pay it back as soon as possible. I have this all in writing.

But of course...he was the one causing shit about it, to the point where it escalated so hard they had a massive argument, of which I was in the loop through Skype where he basically told her to leave as this was his house - the lease was in both their names. However, as she had thrown a lamp through a room in anger, it got turned around on her and she later, as she had checked into a shelter, told the police and the shelter workers that she had been abusive. One of the biggest indicators of abuse.

After that weekend, she had gone back...back into her submissive role...cutting contact with me...

Not for long though, because as soon as things got back to normal... he slipped right back into his abusive behaviour and we couldn't go without each other. Not any more, the idea was there, and as V put it so aptly: ""You cannot kill an idea.""

During this period, my dear employer I came into an agreement with my employer over my future within the company and we parted ways, and I got booking. I booked the flight for her. There was no turning back. We needed to see how deep the rabbit hole went.

As an extra motivation, I pushed myself to quit smoking, as she's asthmatic; never touched a cigarette ever since. 

And as dust was sort of settling down, with the help of my awesome mother, I finally got down to arranging things. I booked my own flight, returning from Vancouver 2.5 weeks later so I also had the chance to get some job interviews in. Transferred funds to my credit card. As we had found the father of her youngest prepared to fly into Vancouver to watch her sons (her ex was not playing nice), I booked a flight for him as well.

Okay, her flight was booked, mine too, sufficient funds, now to get things on the road with telling her ex that she was being flown into Toronto for her birthday for a party where her favourite DJ was playing! Everything was looking awesome! And more importantly, I had a brilliant idea! She wanted to meet her favourite DJ, why not try to make it happen? Especially as we had said over the sudden engagement over NYE that I'd ask her properly when we met! Because I was this sure about her, about us. I sent an e-mail to Darren Styles to ask him for the meet and greet, never hurts to try! Right?! And as I followed up on this with the organizer of the party, I had a hunch that everything might fall into place. 

We still needed to tell her ex... Luckily we found one of her friends up to the task of telling him that her friends were flying her out! And she did a perfect job! Everything was go!

Until...the father of her youngest decided to cancel... *STRESS* What now!? Okay, alternatives?! We tried a whole bunch of friends of her and as these were her boys (and we could not fly them out to Toronto either, as the youngest does not have a passport) and she had no friends out there, we needed to get someone out that she trusted. Family and friends were asked. One after the other had to decline due to various reasons, until... WE FOUND SOMEONE! But as House always says...everybody lies. We booked the flights, until... shit... she had appointments and rebooking cost a fortune, but given the circumstances... there were very few options :-/ So, instead of flying her flying into Toronto on the Wednesday like me and us both flying out on the Wednesday, the sitter was now arriving Friday morning, I was flying into Toronto on the Wednesday as planned, she was flying in late on the Friday, we were both flying out from Toronto on the Sunday evening and the sitter was flying out from Vancouver on the Monday morning! There! All settled!

It was a rush job, but we got it done! All I had to do was get the doctors letter for my medication sorted! Wow...after having called to verify everything with government department #1, it seemed I only needed to get a stamp with them and go to a department that was opened all day... WRONG! Shit! This meant, as I was flying out the next day, that I had to go to the department of Foreign Affairs before my flight! OMG STRESS! Not having slept a whole lot, I managed to get it sorted (getting the odd look because I had packed fluffy cuffs and my suitcase had to go through the x-ray machine at FA :p) and I arrived at Schiphol on time!

Checked my luggage, went through passport control, went to the gate, got a thorough interrogation as I was travelling alone with a stopover in Minneapolis, being nice enough to point out his interrogation techniques to him, explaining my Aspie-being and my medication, sat next to an evangelist on the plane (Hi Bret!), had nice discussions, and finally landed at MSP! I was finally on the same continent as her!!! Nearly!!!

Until the faithful text messages and phone calls came... The sitter had cancelled... Seriously, wtf is wrong with people, don't say yes if you can't keep your end of the deal! BUT! Luckily, I could cancel the ticket for the sitter from Ottawa and she had managed to get another friend to come babysit, someone she trusted and who was able to do it! (Thanks so much again N!) This just meant... flying her in...from Hartford, CT, the US of A. Yeah... luckily, this was the Wednesday, flying out on Friday, we got ""fairly"" good deals through a student travel site and luckily the rebookings for the Ottawa sitter's flights were also reimbursed. As it was less than 24 hours! Okay, new sitter was sorted, flights were sorted and all just before I was off to Toronto!

Flying into to Toronto was an interesting experience, landing at an +45 degrees angle, with the right rear wheel touching down first, awesome flight! And with an awesome Canadian lady next to me, who was unfortunately flying into Toronto for less fortunate reasons. As I landed, I felt it in the air, this epic adventure was about to become even more epic!

I was awaited by one of her good friends, who even gave me a little cash to get something to eat (thank you nice lady at the place near the information desk!!!) and got me on the phone with her! Eager anticipation is the expression. Unfortunately her friend had previous engagements, but after some pointers, we parted ways and after a little help from the information desk (thanks fellas!) I finally found myself a hotel in the area for the night. And after checking in, exchanged some messages with her and then it was time for some sleep!

The next day I made my way to Downtown, on the way meeting a nice American lady from the Smithsonian at the bus-stop, who was on her way from the airport to Downtown for a conference! As I had time to kill and needed to check my options for the night, we were discussing the nicer things of life, and over lunch told her the story so far, after which we parted ways. Another one of life's experiences richer! :) (Thank you S! It was nice getting a view like yours on life!)

Going downtown, I had a good idea of where to stay and after getting some stuff sorted, I ended up at the ""café"" of the local branch of my bank on Yonge Street, enjoyed the hospitality and free internet and found myself a nice hotel a few blocks away. Off I went, checked in, and after a quick bite, more sleep! Finally! Friday! Moved rooms, twice, because I had stayed in a twin room the first night and I didn't know if I wanted to stay there for the night... Finally getting a room with a proper bed! Spent some more time around town, passing time until it was evening...

Due to...ahem...Air Canada...her flight had nearly 4 hours of delay...and as her friend that had come to meet me on the Wednesday and I were sitting there, patiently waiting, upon landing, I received a message from her: ""We have an issue!"" and after exchanging more messages, I got in the nervously waiting mode!

And as her friend and I were casually talking, I saw someone coming closer, only to stop, put down a bag and as I looked, I recognized her and I felt my eyes drawn to hers and as our eyes locked... time stopped and as I slowly got up, she got closer and we first hugged, as I wrapped my arms around her. Right there and then, all the doubts we might have had dissipated and as we broke the tightness of the hug and we kissed, we found home. A journey over thousands of miles had reached a first milestone!

I know that some people might consider this in bad taste or ethics, but you know what... Even as an Aspie, I can tell you with full honesty, you have never felt true love! We needed to control the situation, because she needed to get out of there, she needed something important, perspective, but more importantly...a future! In a sense we both do, or did! Because we found it! Right there and then!

As reality started to set in again, we got talking and she showed me the messages that her ex had sent while she was up in the air, accusing her of being a bad mother as the sitter was sleeping in the bed of one of her sons and her son was apparently shivering on the couch! Telling her that the ""unknown girl"" needed to be gone by 10 or face to be removed by force if needed. Now what... But due to the time differences, we decided to wait until the morning in Vancouver, to at least give the sitter the courtesy of some sleep as she had had a tough day as well!

As it had become quite late, we quickly left the airport for a visit with some of her friends and in the morning, after we had sent a message through FB, we got in touch with our friend. Not surprisingly, she was freaked out by her ex's behaviour and after confirming that her son was not cold (he's used to Ontario winters...in his t-shirt); so our friend left... leaving the care of her boys in the hands of her ex... But we couldn't get the flight rebooked, so I ended up booking her a separate flight after her student travel organizations promised that she could get it reimbursed... FAIL. At least we got her home safely. It was a risk taken in full awareness, just as any other risk on this incredible journey.

As we finally made our way down to the hotel, we hadn't fully realized the time and after quickly dropping off stuff, we picked up some of her friends, quickly continued our way to the CN tower for a video shoot for a crowd sourced video, arriving too late, going back to the hotel, her friends quickly getting ready, making their way, us getting ready and then went on our way...

Arriving at the party, getting introduced to her friends, having a thoroughly good time, enjoying being together! (Yo! Canadians! Heart of Gold was one hell of an awesome experience!!! As the UK crew can confirm too!) And in the end... I got my meet and greet... Thank you Darren on picking up on the Dutch part and asking her if she was the Vancouver girl! It was so cute! She was completely out of it! Meeting her DJ hero and barely ushering a word... but as we thanked him, I took her away and asked her if she didn't think it was weird that he knew she was from Vancouver... at which point she broke... and I told her... and this time, although I didn't have a ring, I asked her to marry me, again! And yet again, she uttered some random words, followed by ""I think so..."", after which we had a tender moment and I looked her in the eye and we both knew it.

After some nice ""after rave"" randomness (Ash, thanks for bringing that cake decorating set from OT! And Dave &amp; Steve, funny guys!), we got to the hotel, and as her friends got their stuff out of our room, we finally got together, alone. Only to confirm what we both already knew...

After a late check out due to a panic attack, we left our stuff at the hotel and strolled around town for a bit, finally making our way to the airport, with some interesting conversations with security about her cake decorating set, we made it to the plane... only not to be seated next to each other... but as we had some kind fellow travellers, we finally got our seats together! And as we arrived in Vancouver, we were so knackered that we decided to get a hotel near the airport and after quickly checking in and getting ready, we finally had a good night together - the last one together unfortunately; because she still had her live-in ex and her boys!

Checking out, we made our way through town, from YVR to Surrey, because there was another hotel of the same chain there, really close to her house as well. On the way there, she asked me the question of questions... If I wanted to meet her boys... Wow, I would've more eagerly met the parents! But in the end...as this journey was crazy enough already...of course I said yes! And wow...meeting them was every bit as natural as meeting her! They even warmed up enough to me to take my hand as we were walking beside a busy street, much to her surprise even! And wow...this was home.

As her youngest was in daycare, her oldest in school, and her ex off to work, we hung around during the day, taking trips around the area, just enjoying time together, as she went back home at night to care for her boys, as we didn't want to make the situation with her ex too volatile. That was until he decided to fall back into his regular behaviour again, giving her shit again, which escalated in such a manner that I was so fed up with it that I wanted to get her out of there, took a cab, called her at the end of the drive-way and offered to get her and the boys out of there! After which I received death threats towards my persona, as he realized that it was over, in a sense that he had competition, effectively threatening to kick her and the boys out onto the street! I had to ""officially"" say goodbye to her and the boys the next day, and I said goodbye to her oldest, he even shed a tear; I knew that this situation wasn't good for him, for them either!

I returned to my hotel, not entirely sure what to do, but they had a meeting with their landlord/-lady again. The outcome effectively being that they supported the attitude and behaviour of her ex, forcing her to build a lie... The story being that I couldn't stand it that she was threatening to harm herself and that I went home. Her ex's behaviour got a little bit better, but right after it was ""safe"" again, he fell back to his old behaviour, but with the excuse of ""no, we have to make this work!""

After that week, I was at loss about what to do that weekend, as there was a party in Seattle that Friday that we had been invited to, and in the end...
I went! While taking the Greyhound from Van to Seattle, I was looking at the surrounding areas and I realized something weird:


I never realized I had missed Vancouver this much, until I got here! A love that I never knew I missed, in a town I never knew I missed; the home I had always been looking for.

After an awesome party, I ended up forcing myself to stay up all night for the 08:45 bus back to Van! But some adventure I had! If you live in Seattle and you know Paps/Pops, say hi to him for me! Awesome guy! And listen to his stories and songs! He's got a whole lot of wisdom to share! Also hi and thanks to Melissa at the Hurricane and Liz at Beth's! And, if I recall it correctly, Jamie, don't ever lose that Dutch guy of yours! We Dutch don't just think we're so cool! Hehe! Also, check out Beth's Place! (7311 Aurora Avenue North) Best diner ever!

In the mean time, we ended up still seeing each other, but in the second week, I already noticed some pain in my throat, which on my birthday turned out to be a full-blown tonsillitis. And while that Friday, the Friday before I was supposed to leave on the Sunday, after having spent 2.5 weeks in Canada, nearly 2 of which in beautiful Vancouver, after visiting a doctor, I quite hastily got to say goodbye to her and the boys... But, later that night, despite the consult and penicillin, I woke up with a terrible pain, my tonsillitis in full effect. I actually took my ADD meds to control the impulses and therefore pain. After waking up, I got myself ready to see the doctor, again... who referred me to the ER.

Trust me, something you don't want to do as a tourist, is get ill abroad! To make a painfully long and mostly boring story short, thank you Surrey Memorial Hospital and Jim Pattison Centre staff! After they hooked me up with an IV and ""the good stuff"", I ended up going back to the hotel later that night, alone, as she could not join me due to the situation, but with an appointment for more IV antibiotic therapy at the Jim Pattison Centre the next day! And the Monday, but luckily, she was now with me! :)

And as her birthday was later that week, the doctor at the centre luckily did not deem me fit to fly yet and I still needed a checkup with the ENT who would possibly need to do a simple medical procedure to ahem ""reduce the swelling"" of the tonsils. Unfortunately, the ENT had a private practice, which meant... no money, no care. Back to the travel insurance, made a new appointment, got the guarantee that the financial side was handled, showed up, and again no appointment to be had. Even got slagged off a little because I wanted to get information. (Vancouver, this is your attitude problem! Someone who isn't paying, might be wanting to give you money later on! Don't slag them off because you have no immediate profit!)

In the mean time, on her birthday, her ex decided to pull a ""Yeah, I'll stay home for you"" stunt, preventing us from spending the day, in reality, the financial situation was so messed up that he didn't even have enough money to buy a bus ticket to get to work, because he only got paid the next day. But because he needed to show that he loved her, he gave her an expensive weekend downtown, while making sure that her bank account was emptied.

On the other hand, I did manage to get a job interview with a Managed Operations (IT) company having an office in Gastown the Monday after! Potentially bringing me one step closer to realizing the dream that started all those months ago...!

Okay, so, yeah, imagine the situation, here I am... just slowly recovering from the severe tonsillitis, faced with my girl being away for the weekend with that &lt;insert derogatory terms&gt;, by myself, far away from home... Of course I'm talking to one of my favourite front-desk employees as a long-stay guest walks in, starts talking to the hotel employee and after getting asked how the guest is doing, she slowly breaks down and admits that she just got fired. Awkward was not the right word...

I saw myself faced with a moment... and because of my journey, I decided to do the right thing, because no matter what my problems were, this woman needed an ear, a shoulder and a hug.

After spending some time talking to her and again telling my story, she came around and said ""What!? You mean you were in the hospital this weekend and yet you're standing here?! Smiling?!"", to which I replied, of course! With possibly the biggest grin I could give, the sparkle I saw in her eye right then, was priceless! :D We talked some more and although not entirely happy yet, she had just lost her job, she went up to her own room, but not after welcoming her to come over if needed! After I had been chilling out for a while, there was a knock... it was her! Together with one of her daughters... And as we stood around, talking, I realized something, we all face a similar struggle in life, the universal thing of not doing the right thing, because we feel the need to over-perform in fear of letting people down. Explaining this, I slowly felt her come around, accepting this negative thing, while not letting herself be held back by it! Because we only hold ourselves back because we let ourselves do that to ourselves. (Think about it!)

After some more talking, we parted ways again, but not before I gave her a bracelet, one that I had found while cleaning out the house after the breakup, one that I had put on my own wrist, as a promise to myself, to do what was needed to make myself happy; I knew that she needed to make that promise to herself, so I gave her the bracelet as she promised to make herself happy! As she asked me what she could do for me to thank her, I just asked her to, when the time comes, give the bracelet to someone else needing a reminder to make him/herself happy! And also if she knew of any hairdressers, because I had grown a fro in the meantime!

Being recovered well enough, I went into the local mall the next day, got my hair cut, and then went out to Downtown, to check the address for the company I had the interview with on Monday, and generally stroll around Downtown, ending up doing a quick round around North too, where... There's been this weird thing... I'd always send stories to her... And in one, I told her... That we went for a walk by the waterfront, where I had asked her to marry me a year earlier...only...in my ""exploring"", I found the gazebo, at Waterfront Park and for some odd reason, it just clicked. I just had a plan. Monday.

While we had been close to each other that Saturday, we had never seen each other, but that Sunday, as the weather was again great, I didn't know how/what, but I needed to put this plan into action...

I got a message, they were going to Stanley Park and... she wanted to see me, even if we couldn't talk. Challenge accepted.

Not before I needed to quickly stop at the mall, to get some cash, but for some reason, I felt myself drawn to a store where we had been checking rings together and on the way there, my eye fell (very un-me) on a jeweller at the lower level with a ton of Sale signs. I decided to follow my instinct and headed down there, and I knew that I wanted something simple, inexpensive, because at the end of the day... it's not about the money, it's about the thought, the idea, of the gift. As I walked up, one of the employees got my attention and I explained the situation, I was already engaged, but it was more like a promise, but not and... She told me to come... She walked over to another section and showed me a ring...

Which was a very plain and simple ring, with a little heart with some diamonds, and...a heart of gold.

And I got a *really* good deal, while it was...perfect.

After getting it, I made my way to Stanley Park, had a nice walk, saw her...it took me everything not to ask her right there and then...but oh wait...her ex...and went back again, back to my hotel, time to iron my shirt and get ready for the awesomeness of tomorrow!

Early night, she came over in the morning, trying to hide the ring as well as possible, shower, shave, dress up, etc. Telling her that I want to go to North to show her something before my job interview! Of course, she feels under-dressed, so we quickly stop at her house so she can put something more fancy on and we continue! We get to the Skytrain, take the Seabus, she wants to lunch first, calm on the surface, inner hurricane of nerves, but get lunch anyway! Could hardly eat, but I tell her it's because of the meds... after lunch, we walk over...as she's cold I offer her my jacket, carefully getting the package out! D: She didn't notice anything! We continue, small talk, she wants to go down the wooden landing, takes pictures of the sea-stars and then we finally go up...and I get to start my talk and as I tell her about the weekend and how this felt like home, with her, looking out from the gazebo to Downtown, I pull out the ring... While telling her that I still needed to ask her decently! Her first response being... ""OMG ARE YOU CRAZY!?!?!"", but I did get a yes out of her eventually! ;-)

Unfortunately, the job interview went different than expected, due to Mountain and Pacific time, the actual interview had actually been an hour earlier. That information had unfortunately not reached me on time, but I still had a really good conversation with the Strategic Officer of the company and we agreed that I would get back to them with the time lines for Work Permit sponsorship. Unfortunately for me, the 8 week period was not a viable scenario to them as they needed someone yesterday.

Then on Tuesday, I finally had the checkup with the ENT, and my tonsils were still inflamed... So as a precaution, I was sent off to get my blood work done, to get tested for Mono, results back in a week!

After that, things were finally looking up a bit I guess, at least after all the turmoil, things were getting a bit more stable.

The days with her have been nothing short of amazing! Even doing little things like shopping! We took the boys out to the park for some pizza and we sent the same thing to each other... ""It felt like a real family!""

This weekend, he has been an ass again, treating her like a maid...like a piece of dirt...

Now, I have the checkup with the ENT on Tuesday, and as it looks I'll be leaving on Wednesday or the day after...and I need to get her out of there!

I also have my flat to sell, no current job in The Netherlands, but motivated to make the impossible happen!

Dear WMO/Reddit/Internet/World,

I could very much do with your help right now.

See, I'm about to do the hardest thing in my life...
To put the happy ending to this story, I am putting the fate of my future in your hands...


Last year, something amazing happened, after my girlfriend of 9 years broke up with me...I fell in love with this Canadian girl.

Only, if only the story could be as simple as in...daily life?

Truth be told, it's much much much more complicated than it usually is.

TL;DR:

- I met the girl of my dreams

- I asked her to marry me, and she said yes!

- she lives in Vancouver, with her 2 boys.

- she is financially dependent on and living in with her abusive ex

- I want to move, but I need a job...

- which is considering the Vancouver job market, the hardest part!

- I've worked as an ICT Consultant in the Network/Security, with Linux/*nix and programming experience.

- I'm available straight away, aside from the immigration process

- I would really like your help!-


Here's the FULL story:

I'm a Dutch guy; just turned 33 2 weeks ago; I finally got diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome last year; had a burn-out partly because of that; I saw my relationship of 9 years broken up in the latter part of last year as well, and later parted with my employer due to the fact that I was about to explore a possible future in Canada.

Then due to some weird twist of fate, through a mutual friend, I got in touch with this Canadian girl! We just connected, on a personal level, no intentions. One part because I wasn't looking for a relationship as I had just come out of one, the other part because she was in a relationship, a bad one but still. We just enjoyed talking to each other and sharing insights into the other genders' minds! Nothing more!

Until we suddenly found ourselves having the night and all the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fall into place! It was like getting back together with that ex of years ago, which just did not work at the time but it sure did now! Only without the previous history...

This was such a paradox to us! This just couldn't be! But... it was perfect! And while we were fighting this - I mean, this could not just be! The distance! Nearly 5000 miles between us! - we just saw ourselves getting back to each other, no matter how hard it got...sleepless nights were had... Yet, still!

As her relationship was going from bad to worse, we were talking on Facebook, then taking up other methods, going to Skype calls as her health didn't permit her to work at the time, then Skype calls to her cell as she was out looking for a job, sending messages to each other to wake up to, etc. We also knew that we needed to meet, as impossible as this was.

Over the course of December, things got so bad that she saw no other solution then to break up with her then boyfriend.

There's plenty I could say about him, but I won't and it's not important... Let's just say that things between them were apparently just not destined to be?

The only thing is...and this is where the plot thickens... She has 2 kids and as she had moved out from Ontario to Vancouver, BC together with her ex and had been in bad health, she had no real financial means to get out; she saw herself forced to stay where she was while applying for jobs. Considering the Vancouver job market, she was was not that fortunate.

It was around this time that the first mention came of a party in Toronto, at the end of March; knowing that she felt the obligation to give it at least one more try and we had agreed that we would give it until the end of March. I knew right there and then that this needed to happen, I needed to make this happen.

Then, over NYE, I had a weekend with friends, so, considering I DJ as a hobby, I planned on making her a mix, which ended up being two mixes, a double, in her favourite genre. (Happy Hardcore for the curious.) Because of my background, I've always been a sucker for naming, so I needed to name it something with big relevance. I named it Perfect Paradox, one mix being in a minor key, called Dusk, the other called Dawn, in upper key. Dusk, for the sadness of the cold of the evening, Dawn for the uplifting vibe of the morning setting in, but also for the moments we shared as the time difference meant that she went to bed as I got up.

On NYE however...Things had escalated again, where her ex managed to push some buttons, making her spiral into this negative stream of thoughts...to a point where she confessed to me that she was writing a suicide note and threatened that if I called the police or anything that she would immediately take the pills she had in front of her; having tried to commit suicide quite early in my life, I knew the mindset. I managed to convince her that this was not the solution, and after I found myself dropping the L-word a week before... I knew that I needed this girl in my life, permanently, and I did the best and stupidest thing ever: I asked her to marry me - and she said yes! Even if this meant that I had to endure beef for this, because my ex was around during that weekend.

And we kept on ""dancing"" from then on, because she had her responsibilities to mind; even though things kept on escalating between her and her ex.

Over time, this ended up being a pattern, where, due to the fact that he was a freelancer, they got into a pattern where - because they had little money - he had become more and more abusive towards her... leading up to a few massive fights between them and no matter how frustrating this was... I kept my distance, because I knew one thing... She was something I had never imagined to be possible, a statistical anomaly at best; I found my one. More importantly, due to the pattern of abuse and the fact that she was stuck in this pattern, I had to get her out of there, to give her something important, perspective.

As this progressed, January turned into February and I had a weekend in London, and because of the massive snow fall this led to disrupted communication, as I had somewhat become her line of stability. Yet, I was not about to give up on her! Pulling an all-nighter, camping at Starbucks for free wifi and food and drinks; but I had become more determined than ever! Despite what she said, I saw the person she really was, piercing through that façade, time after time. This needed to happen. I needed to make this happen.

And as Valentine's day was approaching quickly the week after, it had every appearance that her ex was about to leave to ""the Motherland"" to get work and because she wanted to look for a job, I offered to fly in. I had managed to pull it off with work to take 2 weeks off as I had told them about the situation and got booking, until her ex decided to forfeit the flight and stay...just after I had booked. He had effectively thrown away 800 Canadian dollars to do...more of the same basically, which wasn't a whole lot. Luckily for me, KLM was nice enough to reimburse me the full costs and planning continued.

The party I mentioned earlier, was a party in Toronto; called Heart of Gold, where, more importantly, her favourite DJ was playing: Darren Styles; producer of a track by the same name as the party. I'll get back on the significance of this later. 

Yes, I definitely had a bit of a WTF moment at that time; imagine doing something crazy like that?! Because not only was I about to fly in myself, but due to his persistence in believing in this situation I needed to fly her out as well... Quite the picture!

In the mean time, things got to an all-time low on her end, where they basically could not afford the rent or food; going against better judgement I guess, but making the decision with a conscious mind, I lend them 2000 CAD. On the premise that, as he had a job offer and was getting his Work Permit, they would pay it back as soon as possible. I have this all in writing.

But of course...he was the one causing shit about it, to the point where it escalated so hard they had a massive argument, of which I was in the loop through Skype where he basically told her to leave as this was his house - the lease was in both their names. However, as she had thrown a lamp through a room in anger, it got turned around on her and she later, as she had checked into a shelter, told the police and the shelter workers that she had been abusive. One of the biggest indicators of abuse.

After that weekend, she had gone back...back into her submissive role...cutting contact with me...

Not for long though, because as soon as things got back to normal... he slipped right back into his abusive behaviour and we couldn't go without each other. Not any more, the idea was there, and as V put it so aptly: ""You cannot kill an idea.""

During this period, my dear employer I came into an agreement with my employer over my future within the company and we parted ways, and I got booking. I booked the flight for her. There was no turning back. We needed to see how deep the rabbit hole went.

As an extra motivation, I pushed myself to quit smoking, as she's asthmatic; never touched a cigarette ever since. 

And as dust was sort of settling down, with the help of my awesome mother, I finally got down to arranging things. I booked my own flight, returning from Vancouver 2.5 weeks later so I also had the chance to get some job interviews in. Transferred funds to my credit card. As we had found the father of her youngest prepared to fly into Vancouver to watch her sons (her ex was not playing nice), I booked a flight for him as well.

Okay, her flight was booked, mine too, sufficient funds, now to get things on the road with telling her ex that she was being flown into Toronto for her birthday for a party where her favourite DJ was playing! Everything was looking awesome! And more importantly, I had a brilliant idea! She wanted to meet her favourite DJ, why not try to make it happen? Especially as we had said over the sudden engagement over NYE that I'd ask her properly when we met! Because I was this sure about her, about us. I sent an e-mail to Darren Styles to ask him for the meet and greet, never hurts to try! Right?! And as I followed up on this with the organizer of the party, I had a hunch that everything might fall into place. 

We still needed to tell her ex... Luckily we found one of her friends up to the task of telling him that her friends were flying her out! And she did a perfect job! Everything was go!

Until...the father of her youngest decided to cancel... *STRESS* What now!? Okay, alternatives?! We tried a whole bunch of friends of her and as these were her boys (and we could not fly them out to Toronto either, as the youngest does not have a passport) and she had no friends out there, we needed to get someone out that she trusted. Family and friends were asked. One after the other had to decline due to various reasons, until... WE FOUND SOMEONE! But as House always says...everybody lies. We booked the flights, until... shit... she had appointments and rebooking cost a fortune, but given the circumstances... there were very few options :-/ So, instead of flying her flying into Toronto on the Wednesday like me and us both flying out on the Wednesday, the sitter was now arriving Friday morning, I was flying into Toronto on the Wednesday as planned, she was flying in late on the Friday, we were both flying out from Toronto on the Sunday evening and the sitter was flying out from Vancouver on the Monday morning! There! All settled!

It was a rush job, but we got it done! All I had to do was get the doctors letter for my medication sorted! Wow...after having called to verify everything with government department #1, it seemed I only needed to get a stamp with them and go to a department that was opened all day... WRONG! Shit! This meant, as I was flying out the next day, that I had to go to the department of Foreign Affairs before my flight! OMG STRESS! Not having slept a whole lot, I managed to get it sorted (getting the odd look because I had packed fluffy cuffs and my suitcase had to go through the x-ray machine at FA :p) and I arrived at Schiphol on time!

Checked my luggage, went through passport control, went to the gate, got a thorough interrogation as I was travelling alone with a stopover in Minneapolis, being nice enough to point out his interrogation techniques to him, explaining my Aspie-being and my medication, sat next to an evangelist on the plane (Hi Bret!), had nice discussions, and finally landed at MSP! I was finally on the same continent as her!!! Nearly!!!

Until the faithful text messages and phone calls came... The sitter had cancelled... Seriously, wtf is wrong with people, don't say yes if you can't keep your end of the deal! BUT! Luckily, I could cancel the ticket for the sitter from Ottawa and she had managed to get another friend to come babysit, someone she trusted and who was able to do it! (Thanks so much again N!) This just meant... flying her in...from Hartford, CT, the US of A. Yeah... luckily, this was the Wednesday, flying out on Friday, we got ""fairly"" good deals through a student travel site and luckily the rebookings for the Ottawa sitter's flights were also reimbursed. As it was less than 24 hours! Okay, new sitter was sorted, flights were sorted and all just before I was off to Toronto!

Flying into to Toronto was an interesting experience, landing at an +45 degrees angle, with the right rear wheel touching down first, awesome flight! And with an awesome Canadian lady next to me, who was unfortunately flying into Toronto for less fortunate reasons. As I landed, I felt it in the air, this epic adventure was about to become even more epic!

I was awaited by one of her good friends, who even gave me a little cash to get something to eat (thank you nice lady at the place near the information desk!!!) and got me on the phone with her! Eager anticipation is the expression. Unfortunately her friend had previous engagements, but after some pointers, we parted ways and after a little help from the information desk (thanks fellas!) I finally found myself a hotel in the area for the night. And after checking in, exchanged some messages with her and then it was time for some sleep!

The next day I made my way to Downtown, on the way meeting a nice American lady from the Smithsonian at the bus-stop, who was on her way from the airport to Downtown for a conference! As I had time to kill and needed to check my options for the night, we were discussing the nicer things of life, and over lunch told her the story so far, after which we parted ways. Another one of life's experiences richer! :) (Thank you S! It was nice getting a view like yours on life!)

Going downtown, I had a good idea of where to stay and after getting some stuff sorted, I ended up at the ""café"" of the local branch of my bank on Yonge Street, enjoyed the hospitality and free internet and found myself a nice hotel a few blocks away. Off I went, checked in, and after a quick bite, more sleep! Finally! Friday! Moved rooms, twice, because I had stayed in a twin room the first night and I didn't know if I wanted to stay there for the night... Finally getting a room with a proper bed! Spent some more time around town, passing time until it was evening...

Due to...ahem...Air Canada...her flight had nearly 4 hours of delay...and as her friend that had come to meet me on the Wednesday and I were sitting there, patiently waiting, upon landing, I received a message from her: ""We have an issue!"" and after exchanging more messages, I got in the nervously waiting mode!

And as her friend and I were casually talking, I saw someone coming closer, only to stop, put down a bag and as I looked, I recognized her and I felt my eyes drawn to hers and as our eyes locked... time stopped and as I slowly got up, she got closer and we first hugged, as I wrapped my arms around her. Right there and then, all the doubts we might have had dissipated and as we broke the tightness of the hug and we kissed, we found home. A journey over thousands of miles had reached a first milestone!

I know that some people might consider this in bad taste or ethics, but you know what... Even as an Aspie, I can tell you with full honesty, you have never felt true love! We needed to control the situation, because she needed to get out of there, she needed something important, perspective, but more importantly...a future! In a sense we both do, or did! Because we found it! Right there and then!

As reality started to set in again, we got talking and she showed me the messages that her ex had sent while she was up in the air, accusing her of being a bad mother as the sitter was sleeping in the bed of one of her sons and her son was apparently shivering on the couch! Telling her that the ""unknown girl"" needed to be gone by 10 or face to be removed by force if needed. Now what... But due to the time differences, we decided to wait until the morning in Vancouver, to at least give the sitter the courtesy of some sleep as she had had a tough day as well!

As it had become quite late, we quickly left the airport for a visit with some of her friends and in the morning, after we had sent a message through FB, we got in touch with our friend. Not surprisingly, she was freaked out by her ex's behaviour and after confirming that her son was not cold (he's used to Ontario winters...in his t-shirt); so our friend left... leaving the care of her boys in the hands of her ex... But we couldn't get the flight rebooked, so I ended up booking her a separate flight after her student travel organizations promised that she could get it reimbursed... FAIL. At least we got her home safely. It was a risk taken in full awareness, just as any other risk on this incredible journey.

As we finally made our way down to the hotel, we hadn't fully realized the time and after quickly dropping off stuff, we picked up some of her friends, quickly continued our way to the CN tower for a video shoot for a crowd sourced video, arriving too late, going back to the hotel, her friends quickly getting ready, making their way, us getting ready and then went on our way...

Arriving at the party, getting introduced to her friends, having a thoroughly good time, enjoying being together! (Yo! Canadians! Heart of Gold was one hell of an awesome experience!!! As the UK crew can confirm too!) And in the end... I got my meet and greet... Thank you Darren on picking up on the Dutch part and asking her if she was the Vancouver girl! It was so cute! She was completely out of it! Meeting her DJ hero and barely ushering a word... but as we thanked him, I took her away and asked her if she didn't think it was weird that he knew she was from Vancouver... at which point she broke... and I told her... and this time, although I didn't have a ring, I asked her to marry me, again! And yet again, she uttered some random words, followed by ""I think so..."", after which we had a tender moment and I looked her in the eye and we both knew it.

After some nice ""after rave"" randomness (Ash, thanks for bringing that cake decorating set from OT! And Dave &amp; Steve, funny guys!), we got to the hotel, and as her friends got their stuff out of our room, we finally got together, alone. Only to confirm what we both already knew...

After a late check out due to a panic attack, we left our stuff at the hotel and strolled around town for a bit, finally making our way to the airport, with some interesting conversations with security about her cake decorating set, we made it to the plane... only not to be seated next to each other... but as we had some kind fellow travellers, we finally got our seats together! And as we arrived in Vancouver, we were so knackered that we decided to get a hotel near the airport and after quickly checking in and getting ready, we finally had a good night together - the last one together unfortunately; because she still had her live-in ex and her boys!

Checking out, we made our way through town, from YVR to Surrey, because there was another hotel of the same chain there, really close to her house as well. On the way there, she asked me the question of questions... If I wanted to meet her boys... Wow, I would've more eagerly met the parents! But in the end...as this journey was crazy enough already...of course I said yes! And wow...meeting them was every bit as natural as meeting her! They even warmed up enough to me to take my hand as we were walking beside a busy street, much to her surprise even! And wow...this was home.

As her youngest was in daycare, her oldest in school, and her ex off to work, we hung around during the day, taking trips around the area, just enjoying time together, as she went back home at night to care for her boys, as we didn't want to make the situation with her ex too volatile. That was until he decided to fall back into his regular behaviour again, giving her shit again, which escalated in such a manner that I was so fed up with it that I wanted to get her out of there, took a cab, called her at the end of the drive-way and offered to get her and the boys out of there! After which I received death threats towards my persona, as he realized that it was over, in a sense that he had competition, effectively threatening to kick her and the boys out onto the street! I had to ""officially"" say goodbye to her and the boys the next day, and I said goodbye to her oldest, he even shed a tear; I knew that this situation wasn't good for him, for them either!

I returned to my hotel, not entirely sure what to do, but they had a meeting with their landlord/-lady again. The outcome effectively being that they supported the attitude and behaviour of her ex, forcing her to build a lie... The story being that I couldn't stand it that she was threatening to harm herself and that I went home. Her ex's behaviour got a little bit better, but right after it was ""safe"" again, he fell back to his old behaviour, but with the excuse of ""no, we have to make this work!""

After that week, I was at loss about what to do that weekend, as there was a party in Seattle that Friday that we had been invited to, and in the end...
I went! While taking the Greyhound from Van to Seattle, I was looking at the surrounding areas and I realized something weird:


I never realized I had missed Vancouver this much, until I got here! A love that I never knew I missed, in a town I never knew I missed; the home I had always been looking for.

After an awesome party, I ended up forcing myself to stay up all night for the 08:45 bus back to Van! But some adventure I had! If you live in Seattle and you know Paps/Pops, say hi to him for me! Awesome guy! And listen to his stories and songs! He's got a whole lot of wisdom to share! Also hi and thanks to Melissa at the Hurricane and Liz at Beth's! And, if I recall it correctly, Jamie, don't ever lose that Dutch guy of yours! We Dutch don't just think we're so cool! Hehe! Also, check out Beth's Place! (7311 Aurora Avenue North) Best diner ever!

In the mean time, we ended up still seeing each other, but in the second week, I already noticed some pain in my throat, which on my birthday turned out to be a full-blown tonsillitis. And while that Friday, the Friday before I was supposed to leave on the Sunday, after having spent 2.5 weeks in Canada, nearly 2 of which in beautiful Vancouver, after visiting a doctor, I quite hastily got to say goodbye to her and the boys... But, later that night, despite the consult and penicillin, I woke up with a terrible pain, my tonsillitis in full effect. I actually took my ADD meds to control the impulses and therefore pain. After waking up, I got myself ready to see the doctor, again... who referred me to the ER.

Trust me, something you don't want to do as a tourist, is get ill abroad! To make a painfully long and mostly boring story short, thank you Surrey Memorial Hospital and Jim Pattison Centre staff! After they hooked me up with an IV and ""the good stuff"", I ended up going back to the hotel later that night, alone, as she could not join me due to the situation, but with an appointment for more IV antibiotic therapy at the Jim Pattison Centre the next day! And the Monday, but luckily, she was now with me! :)

And as her birthday was later that week, the doctor at the centre luckily did not deem me fit to fly yet and I still needed a checkup with the ENT who would possibly need to do a simple medical procedure to ahem ""reduce the swelling"" of the tonsils. Unfortunately, the ENT had a private practice, which meant... no money, no care. Back to the travel insurance, made a new appointment, got the guarantee that the financial side was handled, showed up, and again no appointment to be had. Even got slagged off a little because I wanted to get information. (Vancouver, this is your attitude problem! Someone who isn't paying, might be wanting to give you money later on! Don't slag them off because you have no immediate profit!)

In the mean time, on her birthday, her ex decided to pull a ""Yeah, I'll stay home for you"" stunt, preventing us from spending the day, in reality, the financial situation was so messed up that he didn't even have enough money to buy a bus ticket to get to work, because he only got paid the next day. But because he needed to show that he loved her, he gave her an expensive weekend downtown, while making sure that her bank account was emptied.

On the other hand, I did manage to get a job interview with a Managed Operations (IT) company having an office in Gastown the Monday after! Potentially bringing me one step closer to realizing the dream that started all those months ago...!

Okay, so, yeah, imagine the situation, here I am... just slowly recovering from the severe tonsillitis, faced with my girl being away for the weekend with that &lt;insert derogatory terms&gt;, by myself, far away from home... Of course I'm talking to one of my favourite front-desk employees as a long-stay guest walks in, starts talking to the hotel employee and after getting asked how the guest is doing, she slowly breaks down and admits that she just got fired. Awkward was not the right word...

I saw myself faced with a moment... and because of my journey, I decided to do the right thing, because no matter what my problems were, this woman needed an ear, a shoulder and a hug.

After spending some time talking to her and again telling my story, she came around and said ""What!? You mean you were in the hospital this weekend and yet you're standing here?! Smiling?!"", to which I replied, of course! With possibly the biggest grin I could give, the sparkle I saw in her eye right then, was priceless! :D We talked some more and although not entirely happy yet, she had just lost her job, she went up to her own room, but not after welcoming her to come over if needed! After I had been chilling out for a while, there was a knock... it was her! Together with one of her daughters... And as we stood around, talking, I realized something, we all face a similar struggle in life, the universal thing of not doing the right thing, because we feel the need to over-perform in fear of letting people down. Explaining this, I slowly felt her come around, accepting this negative thing, while not letting herself be held back by it! Because we only hold ourselves back because we let ourselves do that to ourselves. (Think about it!)

After some more talking, we parted ways again, but not before I gave her a bracelet, one that I had found while cleaning out the house after the breakup, one that I had put on my own wrist, as a promise to myself, to do what was needed to make myself happy; I knew that she needed to make that promise to herself, so I gave her the bracelet as she promised to make herself happy! As she asked me what she could do for me to thank her, I just asked her to, when the time comes, give the bracelet to someone else needing a reminder to make him/herself happy! And also if she knew of any hairdressers, because I had grown a fro in the meantime!

Being recovered well enough, I went into the local mall the next day, got my hair cut, and then went out to Downtown, to check the address for the company I had the interview with on Monday, and generally stroll around Downtown, ending up doing a quick round around North too, where... There's been this weird thing... I'd always send stories to her... And in one, I told her... That we went for a walk by the waterfront, where I had asked her to marry me a year earlier...only...in my ""exploring"", I found the gazebo, at Waterfront Park and for some odd reason, it just clicked. I just had a plan. Monday.

While we had been close to each other that Saturday, we had never seen each other, but that Sunday, as the weather was again great, I didn't know how/what, but I needed to put this plan into action...

I got a message, they were going to Stanley Park and... she wanted to see me, even if we couldn't talk. Challenge accepted.

Not before I needed to quickly stop at the mall, to get some cash, but for some reason, I felt myself drawn to a store where we had been checking rings together and on the way there, my eye fell (very un-me) on a jeweller at the lower level with a ton of Sale signs. I decided to follow my instinct and headed down there, and I knew that I wanted something simple, inexpensive, because at the end of the day... it's not about the money, it's about the thought, the idea, of the gift. As I walked up, one of the employees got my attention and I explained the situation, I was already engaged, but it was more like a promise, but not and... She told me to come... She walked over to another section and showed me a ring...

Which was a very plain and simple ring, with a little heart with some diamonds, and...a heart of gold.

And I got a *really* good deal, while it was...perfect.

After getting it, I made my way to Stanley Park, had a nice walk, saw her...it took me everything not to ask her right there and then...but oh wait...her ex...and went back again, back to my hotel, time to iron my shirt and get ready for the awesomeness of tomorrow!

Early night, she came over in the morning, trying to hide the ring as well as possible, shower, shave, dress up, etc. Telling her that I want to go to North to show her something before my job interview! Of course, she feels under-dressed, so we quickly stop at her house so she can put something more fancy on and we continue! We get to the Skytrain, take the Seabus, she wants to lunch first, calm on the surface, inner hurricane of nerves, but get lunch anyway! Could hardly eat, but I tell her it's because of the meds... after lunch, we walk over...as she's cold I offer her my jacket, carefully getting the package out! D: She didn't notice anything! We continue, small talk, she wants to go down the wooden landing, takes pictures of the sea-stars and then we finally go up...and I get to start my talk and as I tell her about the weekend and how this felt like home, with her, looking out from the gazebo to Downtown, I pull out the ring... While telling her that I still needed to ask her decently! Her first response being... ""OMG ARE YOU CRAZY!?!?!"", but I did get a yes out of her eventually! ;-)

Unfortunately, the job interview went different than expected, due to Mountain and Pacific time, the actual interview had actually been an hour earlier. That information had unfortunately not reached me on time, but I still had a really good conversation with the Strategic Officer of the company and we agreed that I would get back to them with the time lines for Work Permit sponsorship. Unfortunately for me, the 8 week period was not a viable scenario to them as they needed someone yesterday.

Then on Tuesday, I finally had the checkup with the ENT, and my tonsils were still inflamed... So as a precaution, I was sent off to get my blood work done, to get tested for Mono, results back in a week!

After that, things were finally looking up a bit I guess, at least after all the turmoil, things were getting a bit more stable.

The days with her have been nothing short of amazing! Even doing little things like shopping! We took the boys out to the park for some pizza and we sent the same thing to each other... ""It felt like a real family!""

This weekend, he has been an ass again, treating her like a maid...like a piece of dirt...

Now, I have the checkup with the ENT on Tuesday, and as it looks I'll be leaving on Wednesday or the day after...and I need to get her out of there!

I also have my flat to sell, no current job in The Netherlands, but motivated to make the impossible happen!

Reddit, as I am only human, I could very much use your help on this one!

I've been too many psychologists who say that I do, and some say I don't, have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Other classify it as a hybrid of a developmental disability and ptsd. 

So here goes:

I grew up in an abusive home, with a mother addicted to drugs, a father who wasn't there, and a step-father/mom's boyfriend (it changed throughout the years), which, alongside my mom, would hit me, and yell at me. Not just a little tap on the bam, but a slap on the face, and repeated, overly heavy-handed slaps on the back, and the rear.

I did okay, for the most part, emotionally. When I was 8 years old, I ran away, after being grounded for acting out in school. I suppose thats why I was okay, since I got rid of most of my steam at school, and not in the best ways. I was a problem child, with a lot of problems. Anyways, back to the info, when I was grounded, I ran away. Jumped out of my window, and went off. I was always up for exploration, always wanted to go around my home town on my bike and see what was where and what was what. So, I stole a bike, ironically from one of my very good friends at school, who I didn't know lived there, they never knew I did it. When I returned home, the police eventually stopped by, I had returned the bike, but I guess they had seen where I went from there. That or my mom had called the police because I'd run away.

It was decided that I should be put in a Foster Home. And that Foster Home, was probably the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I went to school, didn't have as many angry outbursts, came home and drew, and drew and drew. And ate. And thats about all I really got up to.

So it came time for me to go back home, 3 months later, and at first, all seemed well. We had to move, my youngest brother left to live with my mom's ex-husband, my ex-stepfather who used to hit me, and me and my mom and my middle brother moved to a different house. Myself and my middle brother had a strong bond, a strong friendship. He was born with some... I guess, things wrong with him. Ticks and stuff like that. And he found it hard to make friends. The abuse started back up again, once we'd moved into the new place, my mom found a new boyfriend, and from what I recall were getting heavy into crack. I've smelt it recently when I was homeless (more on that later), and remember smelling something very akin to that outside their door, which was right next to my bedroom.

One day, the neighbourhood bully, who had never really given me trouble, but had always picked on my brother, decided that he would fill a 2L pop bottle with water, and beat my little brother with it. He came running to me, and I went out their ready to lay a smack down. Turns out there are three of them. I'm not one to chicken out, but I'm also aware of the odd's, so I run back home with my brother, and ask my mom to tell the kids to leave us alone. They sit out on our lawn, for an hour, waiting for me and my brother to come out. She says nothing. And I get mad, because, from what I'm learning at school, this is what she is supposed to do. Maybe I felt entitled, I don't know, but its one of those times when you want your parent to protect you, and for me, it was really upsetting when she didn't.

So I freaked out. I went up to my room, started yelling, and screaming, and swearing, I'd started to calm down, and my mom's crackhead boyfriend comes up, opens the door, and says, ""You're going back to the foster home, and you're never coming back."" So I snapped. Started trashing my room, wishing I could be trashing his crackheaded ass, and my mom called the police. They took me to the hospital, and, well, things were fine. I was starting to calm down, once again, when I heard something familiar. My brother screaming. I stopped, and listened, and sure enough, it was without a doubt him, and I snapped. Went thermo nuclear. Started smashing the glass window trying to get out to go help him. I didn't stop, I wouldn't stop... I couldn't stop. They were hurting probably the only person I had in my life, and my brother at that.

Next thing you know, this nurse and this big dude hop into the room, the guy squeezes my jaw to hold it open, and they put this pill under my tounge and she puts her thumb down on my tounge to hold it down so it'll disolve. Next thing you know, I'm out. Gone. Have no idea what happened.

I wake up, my mom's in the corner of the room, and theres these baby versions of disney characters along the walls. I'm 9 years old at this point, so I'm freaking out. I thought I'd died, and this was like some messed up pergatory. I was scared, so I got up and started ripping the character's off the wall. It felt like what I would call now some ""Silent Hill"" type horrow stuff. Where it just feels wrong.

Nurse comes in, needle in my leg, out again. Then I wake up in a normal hospital room, and things seem, okay. They seem right, I'm calm, don't really know whats happened, but, I'm okay.

So I spend a couple days there, I dont' really know whats happening, I don't have any contact with my mom. And social worker from social services comes in, and tells me, that I'm not going home just yet.

So they put me up in a hotel, with an aid worker, where all I did was watch The Fifth Element every night at the theater, and ate at a diner for meals. This was the life. No screaming, no abuse, things were relaxed, and calm, and I had positive people, and good things around.

Then the day came when I found out, sure enough, I was going back into Foster Care. This time, it wouldn't be in the same place I was already living. It was going to be far away. 

There are very few things in my life that I recall as vividly as this, but the others are always looking out the back of the car when I leave to go somewhere new. Like a milestone in the timeline of my life.

Anyways, so I get to the foster home, and its... its pretty good. But I can't stop crying, I'm scared, i'm far from home, I haven't talked to my mom, I don't know whats going on. I'm in a place I've never even heard of. Out in the country, and everything is alien to me. The foster parents are teachers, so I'm really not accustomed to things being nice. And I'm worried, that they're being deceptive, that they're just trying to be nice to me, and then hurt me more. the whole time, i just want to go home. I cry, and I cry, until hurts, until I'm all out of tears, and my mouth is parched. 

Then i start getting angry, because I want to go home. I feel I need to go home, it may not be the best place, but its where I feel I belong.

Turns out, the foster parents couldn't handle it, and I do feel bad in retrospect, because they truly were kind people. I think things would've been a lot different if I'd stayed there. But onto the next place I went. And this is where it all changed.

So I move to the next place, and this is a bonefied child farm style foster home, they've been wheeling and dealing in the unwanted kid business for years.

Again, I didn't want to go there, I just wanted to go home. So I cried, and I cried, and they would put me outside, and leave me there. And the other kids, and their own kids who also lived there, would go to the door, and poke fun at me, and laugh at me, and then, well, I would get angry, and upset. And then I'd be out there even longer.

Sure enough, a little while later, the laps started. Now, I mean, nothings wrong with a little physical activity. I wasn't in the best shape, so the punishment did me pretty well. It didn't seem abusive at first, but stay a while, its gets much much worse.

So they enrolled me at school, and things were okay there. I made some friends, I made some enemies. Some of the kids tried to pick on me, when I'd responded to their questions about where I lived, that i lived in the foster home. Apparently everyone in the town had heard of that place. And that didn't really go so well for them. I'd gotten into the aggresive, fighter type of mentality. If I can't hit them with words, I'll hit them with fists. Obviously not a good thing, not going to rationalize or justify it, but thats how it was then.

I used to get suspended for being your average little shit that didn't care. And I really didn't. I didn't really feel like living, so I didn't really focus on what I was living for, and how to make the best of it.

When I was suspended, I had to do manual labour, cleaning out troughs, and chipping ice on the road, and I had to do it from the start of the school day, until the end of the school day. And if they decided, they'd just give me a set amount of hours to do. And chipping ice, at 10 years old, isn't easy to do. Scraping up poo, not so bad, stinks but, its easy to do. I cleaned the whole place, chipped off all the cow dung until it was a smooth cement ground. Yeah, I got suspended a lot.

Then the sexual abuse started. I remember being suspended one day, and being brought home, and taken to the office of their home, and I had to do some pretty nasty shit. I don't really like getting into it. Lets just say, hands, and mouth, and all that gross shit I had to do for both the foster mom and dad. It was like chipping the ice, but sexually, I had to get these people off, but really, I think they were getting off on taking advantage of me. Then they started hitting me, and tying me up, and cuffing me in weird contorted positions and raping me. Keep in mind, I'm 11 at this time. The laps got worse, and worse. Each lap was about 120m, and I wasn't allowed to stop until I did five in a row. If I did, they didn't count towards my total, and I had to keep running. They started at 5, then 10, then 25, then 75, and then every time after that, it was just 100. 12km. Come rain sleet, snow or sunshine, I had to be out there. 5 at a time. I started going through puberty, and growth spurts, and sometimes they would rib my pubes out from my crotch when they had me tied up. They wouldn't give me enough food, even after or before running laps, going through a growth spurt, and not getting enough to eat, man. Just remembering how rough it was upsets me.

A little while later, after I'd moved to a different school, I started finding out that I had rights. Not very many, and it was difficult to enforce them, but I had them. Something called the Children's Advocate, mediated between the child and the other party's to get the child's needs met, and stand up for the child's rights. An admirable group of people to be sure. They would play a huge role, albeit being able to help very very little, in the years to come.

Once I had willed up the courage to talk to the children's advocate about what was going on, because I'd told my social worker about running laps, and that I wasn't getting enough food, and she didn't care. So I thought if she doesn't care about that, then I have to tell someone else who can help me. So I made an appointment with the CA, and he was going to come visit me. I was stoked, because maybe I wouldn't have to go through all this anymore. 

I haven't even mentioned the psychological abuse they put on me. I wasn't allowed to draw, or write, these things were bad, and they'd managed to manipulate my social worker into agreeing with this. I couldn't play my gameboy, something I loved and was an emotional escape that helped me cope somewhat. They broke me, broke me down, and destroyed my will. Dehumanized me basically. But I still had that glimmer of hope.

So I'd come home from that day, after talking to the CA to make the apointment, and bragged to them that I wasn't going to have to put up with their shit anymore. That I was free, and they couldn't hurt me. Anymore. That was a bad idea. I should've kept my mouth shut. During the evening, when the other kids were watching a movie, they called me into their office, and then smacked me across the head, and started telling me I'd better shut my mouth, and you're not going to say a fucking thing you little rat. And then the foster dad said, lets do it. then they put me in a restraint and covered my mouth as best they could. I thought I was just getting put outside to run laps, as they'd done with the other kids times before when they'd refused to run them. I was usually complacent and just did it. But thats probably why the kids didn't think much of it. It was normal to them, to us, to the foster parents too proabably. Why they covered my mouth I don't know, maybe they thought I was aware of what was about to happen, I really don't know.

So they took me down to this elongated shed type of deal. Like a workshop thing where they had a saw table and band saw and other things like that.

At first they put my arm up against the band saw, and threatened to turn it on. Not thinking they'd do it, I said, I'm still telling, its wrong, you can't do this to me. And then they picked me up, and threw me on the saw team. And i thought they were going to cut my head off, the way I was place on there. I was sort of fixated on the saw, waiting for it to turn on. And then I felt my pants getting wet. I didn't really know what was going on. I looked down from the saw towards my legs, and saw a jerry can, that they used to fill the lawn mower up with, being poured all over my legs. And then they pulled out a bbq lighter, candle lighter thing, and then I started freaking out. They lit it on fire, my legs, and I remember not really feeling it at first, was kind of warm, but I was still kicking, and then I felt it. Like a cold, numbness from just below my knee's down. I started screaming, and then the foster mom put a blue tarp on my legs and put it out, and then I felt it even more, like my pants had melted into my skin. I couldn't even really fathom the pain, I think I was in shock. But I remember, when they let me go, trying to walk, with them behind me saying, if you say anything, we're going to light you on fire and let you run to the dugout, and then you'll wish we would kill you.

So the day came when the CA was supposed to arrive, and arrive he did. The foster parents came by, where we were meeting in the house, and asked if they could sit in and listen, and the CA put it to me. They said they wanted to hear what I had to say so that they could help make my stay better. So I agreed, what else was I going to say, no, and then tell him, and then he leaves, and what, I'm dead. I didn't know any better than, and I was scared. So the meeting started, and I said, you know what, I'm sorry, I lied, I was just looking for attention, nothing is wrong. Sorry for lying to you. He said, are you sure, somewhat concerned. And trying my best not to give him a hint, I said yes, everythings fine, I'm sure.

And then it all went down hill for me from there. The abuse died down in how often it happened, but it was fucking brutal from there on out. I still have trouble doing #2 properly... to give you an idea.

A year and a bit later, my new social worker, decided it was best for me to be close to home. And so she pulled me out of there.

And boy oh boy, did I have some anger problems. No one knew why, so to them, it just looked like I was fucked in the head. And I probably am. I had really huge issues with female authority, seeing as how the foster mom seemed like the initiator for all the abuse and sexual abuse. So I didn't listen to anything the female staff said in my now group home. They chalked it up to me hating women. But that has never been the case.

Being in the place I was in, I was supposed to have a job. And coming from being in the middle of nowhere, not being to really have friends, or see anyone, and being immensely sheltered, being back in the city, and having a job, and going to highschool, which started at 14, was overwhelming. I struggled at all things. Most of the jobs I had to do, were menial, easy, but I could keep up. I was too stressed out, and when things got too fast, I would shut down, or stop, or freeze. A sign of things to come, for sure. As this persists to this day. 

My anger outbursts were getting worse, I really had no outlets, and no one to talk to, and I was scared that if I mentioned anything, they'd find me and hurt me. or their kids would. So no one really understood the gravity of the situation. Except me. I had this big weight on my shoulder, that I carried everywhere. Not to mention I started noticing that I was much different from everyone else. They had families, and friends, and had grown up with some sense of normalcy, and were, in most respects what the general definition of normal is. So I carried this stereotype, whether others though it or not, I knew it first hand. As the anger outbursts got more frequent, the stress got to me more, the main supervisor used to have to deal with me, and he started getting abusive. Choking me, and putting me in face down restraints and kicking me. And here I was... back where I'd just came from, only closer to my family. 

And that was another issue, I was forced to go on visits with these people who'd basically shunned me. I had very little visitation with my mom near half way through my stay at the previous home, and then it'd dropped off to basically nothing.

My brothers didn't know me, I wasn't the same person, what had happened to me had changed me in so many ways. And being apart from them on a daily basis grew us apart from each other. I was no longer big brother, just the kid that came to visit sometimes.

My mom and her boyfriend were always fighting and getting into arguments and yelling, I couldn't deal with. I couldn't cope with it. It got to the point where I would rather lose my video game privaledges, and being grounded, then go visit my family.


Fast forward a bit here, and I'd moved to where I currently live now. Things, were better for me. I had a individualized goal list, people around me, that for the most part cared, some who cared a lot. I didn't really... get angry anymore. I had friends. And I was still part of that, against the grain, right guy in the wrong place type of deal, but my friends accepted me to some degree, and even a little to them was a lot to me.

And then it started to really fall apart. The worker who was there working with me, left, and I wouldn't say I was emotionally attached to him, it was just I'd never had someone who cared about me, wanted me to succeed, and wanted to see me reach my goals. That for him, me having a great day, was why he came to work. Everyone else there just went there to get a fat paycheque to be some overqualified baby sitter for crazy kids. And when he left, I got one of those people. And then I started getting angry again. started smashing shit, and not giving a fuck. Started running away, and spending more time out with my friends than I was allowed. I was disobedient, and very defiant. Not to mention, my courses at school suffered, not for a lack of trying. But when I was elligable to skip a grade and a level of math, and needed a ti-83 graphing calculator, the group home was unable to reach my social worker, who had by then become a huge problem in my life. The one person tasked with making sure i was taken care of, was around less often than my own mother, which is to say, not a whole hell of a lot.

And then, throughout the summer, I started running away, and staying away. Grade 12 started, and I'd decided that I wanted to go out with a bang, and really focus on school the best I could. By this time, my mom and dad, real dad, had gotten back together. And they were trying to be a huge part of my life. They kept saying they wanted me to come back, and we could be a family again.

And theres nothing more that I wanted, out of anything in life, was to be part of my family again. to belong. To me, it would fix everything. I wanted them to love me, and love me unconditionally, and not judge me, because what I had been through, made me a different person. I didn't have the same deck, so I didn't play by the same rules, I couldn't. It just wasn't possible. It was my sincerest wish that they would've done this. I'd later find out, it'd be exactly the polar opposite.

So I ran away, to live with my family. Things were taking to long, and I just couldn't wait. 7 years had been too long, and I was done. So I packed all my stuff up, and I left. That was another bad idea. I got there, and found out, a day before, my mom had packed up and left and went back with her boyfriend. So here I was, with my angry dad, who I didn't really know, and didn't know me at all. Who was an alcoholic, and way too heavy into pot for me and him to get along. I found out, that basically, the only reason he wanted me there, was so he wouldn't have to pay his debt that he owed for child support. Fucking cool hey? 

So it went on for about 6 months, until he drove my brother home, while being drunk. ANd I gave him an ultimatum, and said, ""Its either the booze or your son."" And he replied, in that stupid, slurry, dumb drunk way of his, ""Well, I guess its the booze my boy."" So I packed up what I could, and left to stay at a friends. I went from there, to my girlfriend's friends place, and then back to live with my mom.

I tried testing the waters, to see if they would love me unconditionally, I needed to see it. I need for them to look at me, and forgive me, be mad yes, ofcourse, but forgive me. So I ordered about $30 worth of porno's that I never watched, off of the cable. And my mom's boyfriend flipped shit. Started yelling. At by this time, people yelling at me went in one ear, and out the other. I could yell too, I didn't really give a shit. So I remember watching the cat, who was sleeping next to me, was having a dream, and his face was twitching, and I couldn't help but laugh. I was worried, I wasn't mad, I'd excepted this. I'd hoped not for it, but, I was prepared nonetheless. And then he flipped the hell out. And it was time for me to move out. So I spent some time at my mom's friends house, and then found out that I was elligble to go to college on the governments tab, so I geared up for some upgrading. My mom told me that she would help me get up there, so, since I had a job, I put as much money into getting prepared as I could. And the day came when I had to leave for college, to meet with my landlord for my apartment there... and well... I couldn't get ahold of her. Turns out, they'd left the city. So i sold what I could, left what I couldn't take, had a change of clothes, and took the bus to the town where my college was. I was there with nothing, I also found out the hard way, that I had no life skills, I had none. I had no idea what I was doing, or even how to figure out what it was I was supposed to do in order to start.

I slept on the carpet in my one bedroom, went to school everyday, but eventually, depression set in, my grades lowered, I was missing classes, and then the government pulled my funding. I eventually ran out of money, and didn't have enough time to work and make the amount I needed in order to live. So I was homeless. I stayed at a friends, and then went back to the city, the one I'm living in now, and stayed with that worker from back in the group home. Things were okay, but, I wasn't able to secure a job. Like I'd mentioned before, when things got stressful, I just couldn't handle it. I've also had problems standing, I've had issues with my feet since birth, and another thing I forgot to mention, was when they would hit my heels, the part I have the most problems with, with a hammer, in some sort of fucked up S&amp;M shit. They knew I had problems with my feet, I think its why they made me run laps so much, they liked seeing me in pain, probably some sick twisted turn on for them. ugh. I hate thinking about that stuff. Trying to figure it out... I just... I don't even know.

So now I had to move out, and I moved in with my uncle, who, was having some addiction issues, and roommate issues. I came home late one night, and forgot my key, so i had to knock, and wake him up. He told me to get the fuck out, and pick my stuff up later.

So here I was, in a City where knew no one, knew where nothing really was, save for the stuff near where my previous years were, but nothing that would help me. Homeless, 18 years old, and homeless, stranded, alone. Not that I hadn't already been alone for the majority of my life, but, alone, once again.

The struggle continues further, but I think you guys get more than the jist. The nastiest stuff is up there. Some bad, but, not as worse things happened later.

If you want to know more about what happened up until, well, around today, I can tell you all the big points. 

But I mean, what would I be diagnosed as?

I'm thinking PTSD, but this stuff, how I am, and how I react, how I live, how I cope, its all, second nature for me. when someone scares me, I get upset, and I get defensive. I wouldn't hit them, I mean, they don't really know why right? But I have horrible nightmares, to the point where I just stay up as long as I can, and then go to sleep only because I pretty much have to.

I eat and eat, and gorge myself,  and its hard to stop. When I get that feeling of being hungry, it just brings me back when I'd come in from the laps, starving. And I can't take it. I can't deal with it, I've GOT TO get rid of that feeling. I hate running to excersice, I had a bike but it got stolen, but it feels like a punishment to me. I can't do it. I can't bring myself to do it.

Most people, psychologists included, tend to see the visage I put on for everybody else. Something I worked hard on from 9 to know now, in order to not look like I don't fit in so much. I may come across as weird to some I suppose, but no one would ever be able to guess. Its a really good wall,and you only get a hint at the issues, through the cracks. I've only began to notice some of these problems, because I've taken the time to think hard about whats going on, and what. 


Sorry for making this so long guys. But I suppose I wanted to give you a really good idea of what it is I live through daily.

Any thoughts or ideas?

**TL;DR Suffered some extreme abuse and neglect, and have some prominent issues going on right now, and would like some perspective on what it might be that has defined the way I exist today. PTSD? Depression? Lack of Oreo's and Milk?**

throwawaylater987,1285960690,/r/AskReddit/comments/dlmna/how_can_i_feel_better_about_my_life/,"Reddit – I am less then 2 weeks away from turning 30 and I feel like my life is awful.  I feel like I'm a disgrace to my family and worthless as a man.  Can anyone offer any advice on how to turn things in the right direction?  I'll go through a brief background but focus mainly on my marriage. 


Growing up I was raised by my Grandparents.  My Mom lived with us as well but usually didn't do much.  She was either on Welfare or working a dead end job at like McDonalds or K-Mart.  She wasn't very involved as she spent most of her time laying in bed watching TV.  She kicked my Dad out before I was born, so he was not part of my life.  We weren't poor but didn't have any money either.  I always got what I needed to get by.  Things were pretty normal growing up.  I did great in elementary school always got good grades, honor roll and everything.  Our elementary school went from K-7 and then high school  was 8-12.  In high school I hung out with different people and went from being the quiet dorky kid who got good grades to one of the fuck-ups who was constantly getting in trouble and kicked out.  I had a problem with authority for some reason.  You cant blame it on the pot as I started smoking herb when I was 9.  I ended up getting kicked out and graduated from Independent studies with help from my Grandfather mostly.  I had no void of a father in my life because my Grandfather stepped up.  He is probably the sole person responsible for me not being in prison or dead already.    I was extremely hard on them and disrespectful up until 16.   At that point I got a job at Baskin Robbins and my circle of friends changed and I ended up in a serious relationship with my first love.  I got my diploma and then went straight to an IT technical school.  

Fast forward a year or so and I've graduated from there and have a job at a bank making $80k and I'm 19 years old and have a wonderful girlfriend who is in college to be a registered nurse and it looks like my life is on track to be good.   The girl and I ended up breaking up due to religious differences.  It was pretty devastating but I was young, had a good job, lots of money, lots of confidence, etc.   So it was rebound chicks and trying to have fun to get over her.  

At this point I'm just turning 21 and I meet and fall in love with my wife.  She is 17, about to turn 18.  Things go great, we're together 2 years and she gets pregnant.  Shortly after this her family moves out of state back to where she was born.  She says it's nice there we should move there etc.  I jokingly  promise that if I get laid off from my job we can move there.  We have our son and get married.   

Our wedding night was the first ever warning that something might be wrong with my wife.  I thought it was just a fluke because she was too drunk or something.  We were at a casino hanging out, spending our honeymoon, having some drinks, etc.  She is still underage at this point but is having no problem getting served at the casino.  She drinks too much, understandable.  We go up stairs and she is beyond drunk.  I mean uncontrollable, disgustingly drunk.   Since she is like this I put her in bed and try to get some rest.  She becomes combative because I don't want to have sex.  She was in no condition to and the mood was pretty much ruined so I just wanted to goto sleep.  She ends up getting so out of control I contemplate how much force it would take for me to knock her out with the champagne bottle.  Eventually she passes the fuck out finally.  She wakes up the next morning hungover not recalling much of the night before.  I chalk this one up as a drunken stupor.   We go back home and things are normal.

Within 6 months I get laid off.  Things are still going great for us, we are happy our son is doing great, everything is falling into place.  I get a very nice severance (8 months) from my job at the bank.  I give in and we go to visit her family and while we are there we decide to buy a house.   We house shop a little and buy a house even though we are both unemployed at the time, although I am still collecting my normal check from severance plus unemployment.  So our money situation was awesome, even more so since we were moving to a place where the cost of living was not even half as bad.  So we come back home and break the news to my family and our friends and everything that we're moving.  We decide that we will hang around for a few more months to give my family some time to spend with our new child.  

Now its a few months later and I pack up all of our stuff and relocate us across the country while the wife and the kid flew.  We get there and get settled in and she goes to work while I do the stay at home dad thing for a while still getting my pay + unemployment.  The severance and unemployment end and I get a job.  We're both working and our son is going to daycare and everything is pretty normal life is good.  My wife gets pregnant with our 2nd child.  I'm missing my family a lot and convince them to try to move out there with us.  They put some of their stuff in storage, pack the rest and head across the country to stay with us.  

While this is happening my wife starts to get sick.  We have no insurance because we're both contractors but shes not doing well so she goes to the hospital anyways.  She doesn't have any explanation other then “sick”.  She says she has extreme back / stomach pain, and nausea.  We figure its morning sickness or something to do with the pregnancy.  The doctors agree and send her on her way.  This continues for weeks and weeks.  So bad that she loses her job.  It is constant vomiting, never eating, rubbing her back raw at this pain that no one can find, etc.  Shes been under psych evaluations, endoscopy, colonoscopy, blood work, etc etc.  No one can find anything wrong with her.  She ends up being hospitalized numerous times.  All they do is jack her up on morphine for a few days until she calms down and then send her home with a nausea medication.  So she would get home and withdrawal from the morphine and be just as sick as ever.  So she would end up back in the hospital.   I'm talking numerous hospitalizations.  Maybe 15-20 during the pregnancy, she has lost 10lbs from the time she got pregnant.   This is just killing us bill wise.  I talk to a bankruptcy lawyer, we start the process and go to court to finalize it.  The judge talks to us for a while and we decide that since shes still pregnant, we're still gonna get more bills when she has the baby and stuff that I should hold off on the bankruptcy until we're all done.  

Finally they decide to enduce her labor 6 weeks early, just because shes so sick.   Due to her not eating and the baby being premature our daughter was born 4lbs 0oz.  She was in ICU and had to be fed my tube and have oxygen for 10 days.    Total hospital bills to date $212k.  Yes.  Two hundred and twelve thousand dollars.  That is more then my mortgage was.   The hospital social worker was sympathizing with us.  We make too much for government assistance and not enough to pay the bills.  We were basically just fucked.  

My family is there to help us out given the situation.  My wife is okay for a couple days then sick again.  Then okay for a couple days then sick again.  In and out of the hospital.  Every time the doctors have no ideas and just keep doing the same thing.  Jack her up on pain meds then discharge her.  This was driving me insane.  It was making me think she was faking it.  The doctors were talking about she was just trying to get the drugs and I was believing them.  So were my family.  So naturally this makes for a hostile living situation for my parents who are staying with us so they decide to go back.   So now it is just us.  I'm working and she is staying home and watching the kids.  She is doing horrible.  She will be passed out on the couch when I come home from work, the kids running around in just a diaper the house a wreck, etc.  It got to the point of me not being able to leave the kids home alone with her.  I had to pay my friends wife to watch the kids.  So we're struggling hard due to a single income with the babysitting expense plus her medications, diapers, formula and everything.  

I do a bunch of research online and find this thing called bipolar disorder.  It seems to fit her pretty well.  Next time she goes to the doctors I tell him my opinion.  Then all of a sudden shes diagnosed as severe bipolar, mood and anxiety disorder and they have different medications that they think can help her.   Since she was already such a hassle for the hospital I believe they were over medicating her to make their life easier.  I do not blame them.  She was uncontrollable.  She would be in my face screaming at the top of her lungs etc.  She would even tend to get physical sometimes.  She would hang on to my legs like a child and not let me leave when things would get too out of control.  I was stuck in a situation where I had no help at all.  I was going crazy.  I was seriously contemplating sending the kids to visit my family and just putting myself out of my misery.   I was able to send the kids to my family for 4 weeks as a vacation and to try for my wife to get things under control without having any responsibilities or anything at all.  Since the kids were gone everyday waking up I would think is today the day I'm going to do it, but every day I would talk myself out of it.  It wasn't fair to the kids.   She gets under control on medication and things seem to be manageable.  The kids come back and everything is on track again.  We're saving money, selling off everything we can to try to catch up.  She gets another job and has it for a few months and we're about 1 pay check from being caught up on all our bills and a chance to be okay for once.  Then she has an episode again and then it causes her to leave work a bunch of days and not show up others, so she loses that job again.   Me having all this stuff to deal with, and days of having no babysitters or having to leave to take her to the hospital or whatever cost me my job.  Now we both have no income, no savings, no nothing.  So we end up up to our ears in even more debt.   She gets a job with her family so that she has more flexibility and they're more understanding.  I get a job and bust my ass and work my way up the ladder again and within 6 months we're about to catch up again then she is back in the hospital again.   

Now this time I'm seriously about to leave.  I don't know what else I can do.   My kids deserve a better life then this, as I think I do as well.  I always work hard, I always move up quickly in a company, I'm always the #1 go to guy.  I can do everything I possibly can right, and still end up behind.   I tell her I'm done, I'm taking the kids and going to go back.  If she ever gets better she can come.   I leave and think about it more and realize its not the right thing to do so I take the kids to get a happy meal and come back home.  When I get there the cops are there and hem me up as soon as I get there for kidnapping my kids.  Her Mom called the cops on me.  I explain the situation the cops say I can't leave the state and everything I already knew and eventually let me go.  At this time my wifes aunt says that if the hospital wont help her enough that tell them she is suicidal and they will keep her longer and help her.  So she tells the cops this and this opens a whole different can of worms.  

So the police called an ambulance and she was taken to a state mental hospital where a social worker interviewed her and she told her how she smokes so much weed because she cant handle it and blah blah.  This is one of the things that her and I fight about.  She would be so “sick” she would spend hours upon hours in the bathtub everyday.  I mean $300/month water bills.  She would roll smoke blunts while in the bathtub.  I have a strict no smoking around the kids policy.  I always go outside or in the garage.  I would never smoke around them and she knew not to as well.  I doubted if she was following this so I would leave for work and then come back like 20 minutes later and she would already have the house smoked up even though right before I walked out the door I would tell her not to.   This happened one time and turned into such a fight that I couldn't goto work and it resulted in me losing that job.   So I'm hanging out at home and a social worker comes knocking on the door.  I have to let her in, she has to inspect every room of the house, she has to check the cupboards, she strips the kids down naked and checks them out, then she separates my son from us and has to talk him in private.   The social worker talks to him about smoking.   She asks if anyone smokes inside and he says mom does.  She asks him what does he know about smoking and he says this “you take the brown thing (swisher) and break it and dump all the brown stuff out and then put the green stuff in it and smoke it”.   Yeah, my 3 year old told the social worker how to roll a blunt.  So they hit me with drug counseling thing and said if I fail this drug test tomorrow I would lose custody of my kids.   Of course I would fail because I do smoke, but not around the kids.   So I immediately assign temporary custody of my kids to my parents and send them there for 4 weeks.  For the kids its a vacation at the Grandparents house, they love that.  For me it was the only option of me being able to keep my kids when I haven't done anything wrong.  This satisfies the Child Services people and they close the case.  At this point I am fuming.  She almost made me lose my kids.  

How can I stay with her and deal with that?  I think I'm just a sucker.  The problem is that I do honestly love her.  I wanted to make it work so  I played hardball with job, got insurance and a huge raise and stuff.   I was making a lot of money so we were able to start catching up and get by with one income.  She was seeing doctors regularly with the insurance and got on a decent medication routine that helped her out.  The kids were happier, my son was in pre-k, my daughter was staying home with her.  Things were going well.  She was even feeling good enough to work again she says.  So I make a resume for her, apply to some jobs for her and get her an interview.   She goes and gets the job.  Its really simple office type job, not many responsibilities, very low key.  She goes in for her first day and bails at lunch because she can't take it.   

So we deal like this for a while, more time passes etc.  Its time for the kids to go visit my family again so she flies with them to drop them off to my parents.  She has a couple days layover so she can spend time with my family and her friends.   She ends up being sick again while out of state and my parents have to take her to the hospital where she gets admitted for a while then released.  Then she makes her take them back again, and then again.  On the final time the hospital staff was very firm with my parents and told them to not bring her back there that they did not want to deal with her.   I think it was she hung out with one of her old friends and shes so much different and messed up that her friend didn't enjoy it so she didn't come back.  The rest of her friends flaked on her as well.  I think this caused her to be anxious and have an attack.  This along with the time my parents lived with us has put a strain on their relationship with my wife.  As  they told me before when I was going through all of that stuff that I should leave, which maybe I should have.   The kids loved spending time so much with my family.  When I came back to visit my family and friends and to pick the kids up and fly them home I did a lot of thinking.  I talked with my friends, my family, etc.  My family is getting really old and they are all in very bad health.  The kids said they would like to live there.  I decided I was going to move back home so the kids and I could spend the last couple years with my family.  I wanted my wife to come with me, but if she didn't want to come I would understand but the kids and I were coming anyways.  She was upset and everything of course.  She decided she would go so we decided that we would start switching her medication to a kind that we could afford to buy with no insurance.  So the doctor started the process and also gave her lots of free sample meds to get her through the transition period and said to contact welfare or something as soon as we get here to get more meds.   I gave 3 month notice to my job and let my friends know I was leaving.  

Her medication switch was pretty rough.  It was like starting all over pretty much.  We flew the kids here 2 weeks ahead so my son could start school on time in the new state and we would be able to pack and get everything ready to move without worrying about them so much.  I couldn't sell the house because of the market so we just let it foreclose.  Our credit is already toast from all the issues with the medical bills and all that stuff.  We went out with my friend and his wife as a final going away kind of thing.  We all got extremely drunk.  We get home and go upstairs and for whatever reason she falls asleep in our daughters room.  I try to wake her up she doesn't listen so I say okay thats cool and then I goto sleep in our bed.  Im startled awake by her climbing on top of me socking the shit out of me.  I'm completely under the blankets, both arms are under there and shes on top of the blanket on top of me so I cant even move.  The dog is going off and barking and  growling at her.  I'm yelling at her and then the dog I guess had enough and was trying to protect me and bites her in the earlobe and I'm able to dump her off and I go in the other room and lock the door.  She wakes up in the morning not remembering anything.   Things at home were pretty hostile at this point  and I was planning on going back alone.  She some how talked me into letting her go by making me feel bad for taking the kids from her.  

We set out on our cross country trek again, this time in the opposite direction.  We don't even make it to 6pm on the first night of driving before she is too sick that she can no longer sit in the passenger seat and do nothing so we have to stop for the night.  This happens the next couple days as well.  So our move back took longer and cost more because she couldn't just sit in the moving truck and relax.  

So its October 2009 and we're back in California.  We're living in the garage of the duplex my parents live in which is converted into a studio type thing.  The kids sleep on a sofa bed.  The kids are very happy, our son is doing great in school.  I'm happy to be back around my family and old friends, maybe I made the right choice even though I'm in a shitty living situation.  Even she seems to be doing great.  I find out she stopped taking her meds when we moved and she feels better then ever.  She thinks the change of everything helped her out.  She gets a part time job shes doing great there.  I'm having a tough time finding an IT job in the Bay Area at the end of the year, its a horrible time to be looking.  The place she is working at goes out of business.  I was able to find her a job with one of my friends parents.  She loves the job, and the people there love her.  They say shes doing great.  I finally get a job in March.  It's a decent job.  Very laid back, the people are pretty cool but the pay is just not enough.  Her work is going so well they give her a promotion and more hours.   Things are going great as the hours are steadily increasing.   Then all of a sudden she is too sick one day at work and has to leave.   Then the next day she is too sick and has to leave again.  Goes to the hospital and is admitted.  She had to get on disability at work.  She was in the hospital for 2 weeks, then they're making her go to outpatient clinic full time, 6 days a week 8 hours a day for therapy.   She's not working anymore.   Supposedly her job is supposed to take her back when she's done and she will only work part time.  

So this is where we are at now.  I feel that I have messed everything up by coming back to California.  I did this because I was scared of things not working out with the wife and would like some support if they don't.  I have family and friends here in California so I would like to be here if it doesn't since I can't take the kids out of state.  I thought we would all be happier here.  She is still going to this outpatient program, she is supposed to be done today.  She is supposed to be released to go back to work on 10/10.  Which just so happens to be my 30th birthday.

I feel like I have let everyone down.  I'm having a hard time getting along with my Grandfather.  He is very very mean to my wife and daughter.  I think it may be because he comes from different times (he was born in 1930) so he treats all women badly, my grandmother and my mom included.   It is unbearable for me to watch him do this to my daughter.   She is constantly saying “Grandpa doesn't love me.  Grandpa is being mean to me.  Grandpa hates me” etc.   He is very old and very sick.  He is just a bitter bitter old man.  Even his brothers and sisters disowned him.  He got sick after I left so he kind of blames me for it.  I came here to spend time with him and have some good final memories of him and my children.   All that happened is that I regret coming here because all of the memories I have recently are bad ones.  It makes for a very difficult living situation, plus the kids don't have their own rooms.  It's just bad all together.  With her not being able to reliably hold down a job and my job not paying enough.  We are pretty much stuck.  I don't see any chance at all of us moving out.  I've been trying to find places but they are mostly out of my price range or if I can afford it I fail the credit check.   I've spent $500+ just doing rental applications just to be denied on every one.  I have a piece of crap car I got for $100 that is on its last leg and cant drive more then 10 miles at a time.  I don't have any money.  I live in a shitty roach infested garage.  I feel like I have let everyone down.  I left our life there thinking that material things don't matter its about family and friends.   Only to get here and my family be making us miserable and my friends that I never see.  I feel like even my friends don't like.  I feel that I don't fit in anywhere.  I have no answer to tell my kids about why they cant have their own room.  Why their friends cant come inside, why we have a shitty car, why we can goto the beach or to a birthday party that is far away, etc.  I am feeling stuck.  I don't see any way out.  I try to look at my and use them for my happiness but its still really tough.   I feel like I don't even have any friends or family to turn to.  I can't even goto my wife with anything because she cant even deal with her own stuff.   I feel like I have been taking the bulk of the crap thats happened over the past 5 or 6 years.  I was the one that always had to figure out everything.  I was the one that had to make sure the kids were fed and had a place to live.  I was the one that had to deal with anything that came up.   I feel like its all catching up to me now.  I feel like everything is closing in on me.  I don't know what else to do.  I have been looking for other jobs but the market still isn't so great.  

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to feel better?  What steps should I take to try to get my life back on track.  How can I feel like I'm not letting everyone down when thats exactly what I'm doing?   I feel like I'm turning into a rock.  I have a hard time feeling any emotion other then anger.   I am worried that being this angry all the time is potentially dangerous to random strangers that cross me.  No I do not beat my wife or kids, but I am a lot more confrontational to random assholes or people I encounter who deserve it.   I just want to feel happy again.  

**UPDATE**  Here is some more evidence of the wonderful luck I have.   I just got off the phone with her.  Her outpatient therapist has released her to go back to work today.  She has completed the therapy after 2.5 months on disability.  The hospital says that they are not allowed to fire her because shes on disability that they have to give her the job back.   She called her job to tell them the good news and they said they have already hired someone new.  The hospital says that she should seek legal advice that it is against the law.  I feel divided in this decision.

[deleted],1292510661,/r/AskReddit/comments/emtn8/i_admitted_i_was_an_alcoholic_to_myself_and_close/,"So, here I am, an admitted alcoholic, but I do not think I need to attend AA. I know the underlying issues as to why I drink, and am very self-aware and self-critical. I want to stop drinking, there is no question that I cannot indulge in it anymore as it has hurt me and the people around me. It has ruined so much. You'll see what I mean, but I still need input. Here's the requisite backstory:

I'm 22, Canadian, unemployed, and not in school quite yet. I started drinking relatively late, at 18. This was January 2007. I had a deal with my parents that if I didn't drink or do drugs until 18 they'd compensate me handsomely. Fast forward to 18, I stick to my word and come out with about a grand and a macbook courtesy of mom and pop. I buy a quarter pound of weed and sort of got into selling (more on this later), and hit the sauce with my buds virtually days after I had turned 18. I was in the middle of grade 12 at the time, but I only had one class that last semester and it was english which was no problem. I loved getting drunk. I loved everything about it, it made me sociable, confident, etc, apparently how it starts out for everyone. I didn't have a job through highschool, so drinking wasn't frequent especially because I was one of the first kids to turn 18 and no one went to bars, but it was always heavy when it did occur. I graduated fine, but opted to not return to post secondary due to feeling like I missed out on the party years of highschool, with me not drinking and getting fucked up like my friends did. 

My first major fuck up drinking was me getting arrested for graffiti and possession of prohibited dangerous weapon (brass knuckles) while completely hammered. I woke up in a holding cell covered in blood, vomit, and dirt. I had apparently ran from a cop car that caught me bombing this wall right off a main drag (wonderful drunken idea on my part), got tackled by a cop on foot, skinned my knees down to the bone, and called a cop a pig which contributed to a fair degree of brutality on their part and no lenience with the law. I had thrown up on myself in the car ride to the station, and they let me sober up in a cell. I ended up having to pay a $5000 fine and another $500 to a charity of my choice. My mom footed the bill, and that put tremendous strain on our relationship and further provoked me to drink because I was so disappointed with myself.

My parents divorced that summer, and I moved in with my dad because my mom was such a miserable cunt to anything male. The divorce was not pleasant, I saw the ugly sides of my parent's personalities, and that's when I started really drinking to kill emotional pain and murder my memories. My mom and dad used to be my best friends, but when divorce time came they tried to leverage my brother and I against the other parent, so I coped by always being drunk. My weed business supplied me with the money to go boozing, and put me right into the thick of the party. Everyone wanted to go for drinks, everyone wanted me around, and the last place I wanted to be was at my apartment with my dad listening to him tell me how much he hated my mom. I mean, making runs and getting drunk was awesome. It occupied my time, I was popular, but I started finding myself in bars or drinking alone more and more often, just for something to do. My three friends that I used as my support network evaporated from my life; one moved to another city, the other got wrapped up in a boyfriend, and the other went to post-secondary and didn't have the time or inclination to go out drinking and hear me out. I felt very alone, and booze was a good friend.

By that time I was stacking enough paper between selling dope and working part time to move out, and that's when shit went down hill. This was about March 2008. I lived in this house on the opposite side of the town with two girls where virtually all we did was party. Every night, boozing. I was always blue, not knowing why, just ridiculously unhappy. I've always been an introspective person, and kinda suffered from moderate depression, but I had never been that down to that level. I just hated everything, especially myself. I didn't like the person I'd become. I'd abandoned a lot of friends in favour of selling weed and party people, and sacrificed relationships with girls because I didn't have the time. All I had time for was selling and boozing, both of which conveniently went together hand in hand. But I had this deep sense of self-loathing that only seemed to go away when I was wrecked. I blamed others, my friends that I had lost, the girls that I missed, for not understanding or being there for me, which further fuelled my need to get drunk. I didn't realize they weren't there because I was so toxic to be around. 

I eventually had a falling out with the girls that I lived with and moved back in with my mom. When she picked me up she nearly cried, when she had helped me move in I was 185 (I'm 6'3), when she picked me up I was 135. Neither parent had seen me much, maybe 3 or 4 times over the entire course of my 8 month stay in that house, due to the divorce and me being preoccupied with my retail jobs, illicit or otherwise. My mom sensed that something was wrong but knew better than to question me because I was so volatile and irritable if I wasn't stoned or drunk. I attempted to continue selling weed, but my mom caught onto that pretty quickly and served me with the ultimatum of quit or leave, and that would mean leaving a place that was rent free, stocked fridge, and my dogs. I said fuck it, changed my number, and was done with selling dope. I had recently quit my job at the skate shop and got a job as a porter at a new bar that was opening, under an operating company where the staff discount was 50% off food and liquor. The tips were great, I had good hours, and booze was diiiiirt cheap. This was the beginning of the end, around November 2008.

I was forced to move out again in March 2009 due to my mother not being able to take my lifestyle. I was legitimately drunk every day. I was mean, belligerent, and abusive to everyone around me. Virtually the only time I wasn't drunk was at the start of shift at the bar, but by the end I'd be fucking wasted. It cost me nothing. Everyone around me drank. I felt awesome. My three rules were this, if I could afford it, it's not affecting my health, and my relationships weren't failing, it wasn't a problem. I was so deep into denial that I couldn't see I had broken every rule long ago. Working in the bar industry, I predictably got into coke and MDMA. I wouldn't say I was addicted to either substance, but they definitely played their parts in my eventual disintegration. I'd start the night off drinking, take a pill, keep drinking, get blackout drunk, and then rip bangers to keep partying. 

Late that summer, my dad got married to his new girlfriend of a year that I had barely met, and dropped the bomb on me in front of his side of my extended family. I can't remember the month that followed because I got so wasted every night. I felt so wronged by my father, he barely knew this woman (lo and behold she turned out to be a psycho, but that's beside the point), and she treated my brother and I like such shit. I had lost him, and for a time I did, but not because of his relationship with this woman, because I just spent every waking hour I could getting wasted. I was now at the point where I was not speaking to either parent except for occasional small talk when I so happened to see them in public, and felt very abandoned not realizing I was the one pushing myself away from the people I cared about. At about that same time I split with the girl I was seeing because she had cheated on me for, get this, because I spent too much time getting fucked up than I did fucking her, so she went elsewhere. Shitty move on her part fundamentally, but it takes two to tango and that's how it is. I slipped deeper into depression and self-loathing and things got worse. I was hammered in the bar I worked at when she broke the news to me via text message, and I ended up breaking a mirror in the washroom with my fist in a rage. I cut my hand up really badly and got written up and had to replace the mirror, but was not fired miraculously, partially because I was very good at my job and it would be a pain in the ass them hiring someone else.

It was fall 2009 that I moved into a particularly self-destructive environment filled with primarily drug addicts and dealers. I lived there a month, but I was pretty much high on coke and E, drunk, and stoned for that entire time. This is when my coke habit kicked into high gear. I moved out of that house into what will be known as Bad Haus. Around the same time I met a girl known as Big Red, or BR for short. BR was older than I was at the time by 5 years, and I thought ""Score!"". Things were good until my birthday at the start of January. The night previous to my actual birthday, I got really drunk and fucked up with my friends, and the hangover was such that I was half an hour late for dinner with my parents, and BR. This was her first time meeting them. She was livid with me, both for being late but by being so visibly hungover. I had done a shitload of drugs the night previous and had no appetite, instead ordering enough booze to get me drunk by the end of dinner. I worked things out with her, but I could tell she was bothered by my habits, and eventually after about 5 months she dumps me because I cared more about getting wasted than hanging out with her. I cared deeply for her, and it hurt, so I did what I always did and got annihilated. The shine of inebriation had worn off long ago, I used it instead to run from the growing emotional pain I felt, my deepening depression, and my ever-mounting self-loathing.

I make a trip out to the olympics immediately after Big Red and I part ways. I spend 5 days in a drunken stupor, picking fights in seedy East Hastings bars, with people on the street, and miraculously coming out unscathed, but putting my friends in very real danger multiple times. Again, I'm a drunken idiot.

My bosses had noticed my attitude and work ethic steadily declining, and I was threatened with termination if I didn't clean up my act. It cost me a promotion, and planted the seeds of me getting fired from that same job months later. Everything kind of went as usual, getting drunk, but keeping my attitude out of work and remaining employed. I was known as a miserable bastard, and was the pariah of the staff. I went to bed and woke up hating everything. Even when I was drunk I hated everything. I added more and more drugs into the mix, eventually getting up to at least 4 or 5 substance nights, most nights. Anything to kill the hate-speak running through my head. In March 2010, my friend and roommate had a massive heart attack after a night of us partying. I had to bring him to the hospital while I was still fucked up too, and that's when gears long rusted started to turn and I finally started realizing how this was killing me and my friends. My friend survived, but at the cost of always being afraid of dropping dead if he ever exerts himself a lot. I moved back into my mom's house a few weeks after. I didn't really touch drugs after the heart attack incident, but I still drank, and I still hated everything. 

Fast forward to June, when things really start sucking. The bar I'm working at shuts down, and the company moves me to another location they're opening. They dock my pay, my position, and everything I had worked so hard for over the past year and a half. I'm stuck back at the bottom of the totem pole, and I'm bitter, I couldn't understand why. Of course, now I realize that it was because I was such a degenerate drunken drug addled bastard that I was a liability, but in classic denial I blamed others and never questioned myself. Two days before the opening of the new bar, I'm training 2 of the support staff, and I'm pretty drunk. I had been drunk since before arriving to work, crushing a six pack at 10 am to be at work for 12. One of them asks about drinking on shift. I loudly exclaim that as long as they can still do their jobs, I didn't care if they were drunk, high on acid, or stoned stupid. I then use myself as an example, citing that I was drunk right then and could function fine. What I didn't know was that one of the owners of the entire company was around the corner, and promptly fired me. I had now lost damn near everything, but not quite. I use the next month to recover my ego and get really drunk off the severance I got. I neglected to pay my phone bill and rent to my mother, and more or less said fuck it. 

My cousin's wedding is in Seattle, my mother and I fly down. At the wedding dinner, I get blackout drunk and make a damn fool of myself, calling my cousin's new father in law a republican sack of shit, a bigot, and a warmonger, and immediately after storming out with a 12 case of stella to drink by myself in the car. My mom finds me passed out on the hood covered in beer and yelling in my sleep. I wake up with the second worst hangover of my life, and face disapproving stares and whispers from my relatives at breakfast as I not at all discreetly make 5 minute trips to the washroom to heave, which I later learn is audible throughout the entire restaurant. I hear from my mother that my cousin thinks I ruined her wedding, and again I hang my head in shame.

A week after I get back I meet up with my best friend of 10 years. He's a nice guy, my best friend for a reason, but my polar opposite. He's in school, timid, doesn't drink that much and doesn't like to. I always enjoy his company because he listens to me. On this particular night, I walk him home after a rowdy night at the bar. We're close to his house, and he stops me and says he needs to say something. I am of course receptive, he is my best friend. He continues on to tell me that he doesn't want to be friends with me because I have turned into someone he despises. Without another word, he walks off. I haven't talked to him since. Later that night I self-medicate with booze and a bunch of MDMA, but feel that sinking feeling of total self-loathing, disappointment, and sadness. It hurt so much because I knew he was right; I didn't even like myself, I hadn't for a long time.

I apply for and get another bar job, at a rival bar company than the one that previously let me go. Word travels fast in that industry, and my old boss corners me on a night out when I'm wasted and asks me if I want to spy for him, as the new bar I'm employed at is direct competition for their flagship pool hall. I say I'll consider it, and a few days later decline based on the fact that a paycheque isn't worth my reputation. However, I have a very big mouth, especially when drinking, and since I'm always drunk, I always say shit I shouldn't. So, over the course of the next few weeks I tell people the hilarious story of how my old boss wants me to spy on my old boss. This bites me in the ass a week later before the new bar is slated to open and I get fired for allegedly being a spy. I couldn't blame them. I could only blame my big mouth. I proceed to get increasingly drunk as my self-loathing is at an all-time high.

I spend a week getting mangled, and go on yet another trip on the September long weekend to Vancouver for my grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary. At dinner, I get drunk, but not even near as wasted as I was about to get. I knew people in vancouver, and they invited me out. I black out at 9:30, I wake up at 10 the next morning and I have no idea why my family won't look me in the eye, other than suffering from the worst hangover I have ever had. I had apparently broken into the hotel with my friends, stolen furniture, harassed the front desk clerk and threatened to ""maul [her] with my penis"" if she didn't give me an extra room key to replace the one I had presumably lost drinking that night. I find it almost immediately after this exchange, and stagger off with the parting words of ""Fuck you you fat cunt."" This is all relayed to my father via a curt letter slipped under his door. I spend the day dry heaving around the streets of vancouver, being cold shouldered, and feeling like shit.

Fast forward to mid october. I'm selling coke and MDMA because I can't (read: too depressed and self-absorbed in a pool of pity to) get a job, so I'm on the grind. I'm still not really touching drugs as much as booze, maybe with the occasional pill of MDMA. On a whim I go see one of my favorite bands at the urging of a good friend, the one that had moved to a new city years ago to return this year, so I'm like fuck it, why not. There, I am introduced to a girl named we will call Brucie. The night progresses and I get her number, not really thinking anything of it. Later that night I'm cruising facebook and I see that she's added me. She starts chatting with me and before I know it she's in my bed. The next month rules. She becomes the catalyst for me stopping selling drugs, enroll in school, and start questioning myself. I learn that she had recently got out of a two year relationship with an emotionally abusive prick, and tells me that she can't do a relationship. I won't lie, I rolled my eyes at this because this girl was over at my house and in my arms at every waking moment, telling me her secrets, telling me how much she liked me and how strong her feelings were, and making all the right moves. It would have been one thing had it just been casual from the start, but feelings were added to the mix and that's where shit got sticky. All of a sudden, she has a freak out and tells me we need to chill, and more or less stops talking to me for a week. I demand to know what is up, and start going crazy. I had done everything right with this one, I hadn't been drinking that much, I had been making moves to better myself, and I had been positive. I start drinking, hard, to make myself feel better. One saturday, at the end of the night a week and a half ago, I push the subject and demand that we talk things out because I in my infinite wisdom think talking about matters of the heart is a fantastic idea when I'm drunk and fucked on MDMA. I don't remember the conversation. But it was not a therapeutic one. She doesn't really talk to me for the week after. This most recent weekend and the week previous, I am wasted. 110% Mr. Lahey drunk. Saturday I go over to the chill pad and pick a fight with two of our mutual friends who we're all supposed to be drinking with that night. I pick the fight on the basis that they are talking shit about me to Brucie behind my back, and that they should mind their own business. While I kind of had a point, it's not a good idea to fight drunk because one is at their most selfish. I end up making them go home. Brucie drops the rest of us off on the strip and goes home, I ask her why, and she just gives me a look like I'm retarded. I wake up the next day beside myself. I call my one friend and to see what I had done in the blur that was the week previous. I have pushed Brucie away completely, she is no longer interested, and the two friends I picked a fight with refuse to talk to me. This was Sunday. It is now Thursday.

Reddit, I had epiphany, I guess late Tuesday, early Wednesday. Obvious for you, the reader, but I have lost my closest friends, pushed my family away, disappointed everyone, lost 3 girls, 2 jobs in the past year, destroyed my health and my sanity, all for booze. Here is the reason I don't feel AA would be beneficial. I know the underlying causes why I drink. I drink because I am depressed, I'm selfish, and I don't know how to cope with emotional pain. But I'm also pretty intelligent, and I'm not blinding myself anymore. I know I need to stop drinking. I don't have the desire to anymore. I have lost so much that mattered to me that I don't know what to do, but I know now that drinking will only make it worse. I need to get into counseling for depression, and I need to stay away from bad influences. I have been shunned by my friends that I still do have as that one dude they don't want to introduce anyone to because I'll embarrass them. I recognize the cyclical nature of the condition, being I get sad, I drink to make myself feel better, only make things worse, repeat. I need to deal with the root problem that is my self-loathing and depression, and then I'll be fine. I've arranged myself to be barred from most bars in the city to remove temptation, and I will be talking with a counselor soon. I have been brutally honest with you, and myself. Please, advise.

EDIT: I don't know about AA because of the dogma pushed in it. I am a staunch atheist. Don't view it as me not wanting to go, I'd just like alternatives.

EDIT 2: I have made an appointment for an assessment. I asked about the religious aspect and the woman told me they have different groups for different creedos. So, I am booked tomorrow for 8:30.

Hi everyone! 23 year old, female, 2020 grad in the US and current math/english/computer science tutor here. Been a TA in 3 different disciplines, convinced professors to restructure classes, gotten WIFI upgrades for a whole dorm building, and so on. I want to share that knowledge with people that can use it, since it made my life so much easier in school. After hearing from so many of my students, and seeing so many ""advice for new college student"" posts all over reddit, I wanted to post here with a list of some of the best tricks I accumulated in my time at school. Some may apply more than others, since my school was on the smaller side. However, many center around one thing - get to know the people who work at the school. And not just your professors. They know things and can help in ways you don't even know about.

Much of this is from personal experience, or from stuff I've heard from friends or tutoring students. Don't take it all as gospel, since some of it may not apply to the college you're at but try to read it for some of the general concepts if nothing else. Also I am sorry it's so long, I really want to give y'all as many tools as possible though. 

# The FIRST and most important thing is names.

Names are one of your greatest weapons. People like to be remembered. And you can get a lot more help if you can ask for a senior person by name. Not in a demand-y way, of course, but being able to say ""Oh, is there any chance that Bob is in today? He was great when I needed help with X, Y, Z last time!"" doubles as a compliment and a means of getting speedier/better help! **Keep a running notes list of people and interactions with them.** I recommend in your phone, either as an actual list, or a series of contacts with their company field set to their job, a phone number for them/their department, and whatever other info you find helpful in the actual notes part. Seems like a bunch of clerical work but it is OH SO HELPFUL when you need a new bed frame and can just open contacts, type in ""SCHOOLNAME maintenance"" and see that you had Steve fix your door when the lock broke and Glenda was the nice desk woman who sent him.

Given the above example, here is a good starter list of people to know/get help from

* **Janitors or maintenance people** \- they like you? You've been nice to them? They'll be more helpful than they probably would. Most people think of them as background, but they're the reason the showers work, the heaters don't spew dust and can fix your door when the lock gets jammed. By senior year I had enough cred with these guys that I got a full new set of furniture and mattresses for my room. Totally worth it.
* **The person that answers the phone in the maintenance office**. They just know most, if not all, of the maintenance guys, and probably a lot of coordination and behind the scenes people at the school. Call with a simple question, and REMEMBER (or write down) their name.
* **Security guards -**  most schools will have a main security number that you can call for a bunch of stuff they may not actually mention. I had some joint issues that screwed up my ankle for a few years. Sometimes walking across campus between classes wasn't possible. I could call them up and they'd come pick me up and make sure I got to class okay. This was not an accommodation thing either, they did it for anyone that asked. It also applied to feeling unsafe walking around at night, etc. It can really help. Keep the security number in your phone as a contact all its own.
* **Teachers assistants / free tutors etc -** I'm talking about the writing center, the math tutoring that many schools have, TA's that have office hours, lab TA's and on and on. If they're still a student and working in some teaching capacity its VERY likely that they WANT to help and really enjoy it. I loved hanging out in the ceramics lab when I was a TA and was always THRILLED to be asked for help. We do it to help, and if you're nice to us we'll often go above and beyond. There is another side to this, if you go to tutoring/office hours of those student teachers and TA's - you'll meet other people (probably from your class) that are trying to study. Possible new friends or at least fellow commiserators are always a plus! And you'll have more people to panic text if you're not sure when an assignment is due.
* **The IT desk people -** They keep the wifi up. And the wifi is usually very important for studying, etc. Make sure you know the name of at least one actual university staff member that works there. They often hire students, and the students can help but are usually rather limited. Also, if you ever need to get them to fix something, especially in a dorm, get at least one or two other people to agree its happened to them and then call it an outage. The word ""outage"" indicates a special kind of *get on this right now* in IT. I got the Wifi in my dorm upgraded cause I went to them with a petition from like 30 people about how bad the wifi had gotten in my dorm :)

# On to academics:

I took a lot of classes across a lot of disciplines, so each trick's usefulness may vary school to school, though many of them are pretty all encompassing.

* READ the syllabus. It will tell you many things that are not explicitly written.
   * For example: Is there a schedule? Yes? Good! You should write all those dates in your planner/calendar. No? Pay closer attention to what the professor says is upcoming during lectures. Profs will often tell you if they will move exams slightly during syllabus day. Remember which ones they are, cause they're more likely to reschedule a test if another couple major courses have an exam the same day. 
* Many people talk about picking the class for the professor. ALSO PICK IT FOR THE TA/GRADER, WHEN APPLICABLE.
   * Find out if the class is graded by the actual professor, a grader or a TA. Many classes, especially smaller schools will have things like math homework graded by TA's/graders and exams etc graded by professors. This saved me because physics lab was TA-graded and I managed to pick the section of the most experienced and lenient grading TA. Made a hard class WAYYYYY more manageable.
* IF you are unsure which of a few general requirements to take, sign up for one (or even two) extra, go to each of them and drop the ones that seem the least appealing. Base this at least partially on the professor.
   * You may get there, see the syllabus and go ""SIX ESSAYS at least TEN pages EACH?!"" and be able to have a fall back class that still fills a requirement. This way you're not scrambling to find a replacement when the good courses are full.
* WHENEVER you have an essay due, make an outline that's fleshed out enough to give an idea of your thoughts and arguments, at least a week before the due date. Then schedule a meeting with the professor to go over it.
   * The feedback they give is always helpful, follow it. People like their ideas acknowledged. The most important thing (at least that I found) was how they reacted to it. Did they like it? Keep it. Didn't like it? Tell them next class that you reworked the topic cause you thought of something else. They have to read tons of papers, and interesting papers or ones that aren't about the Same Thing tend to not be compared to as many. The smaller the sample size of papers for that topic, the more likely you are to not be graded as harshly. 
* If you dislike a professor, offer to help them. Show up to their office hours, even just to chat. Chances are that a lot of students dislike them, and a little kindness goes a long way.
   * Even the profs I disliked for their teaching style were cool human beings. Professors that are actually BAD on all fronts are rather rare. See the good side and play into interacting with them that way. In doing this, I convinced the worst (terrible teacher, questionable human sometimes, but very intelligent) professor that the computer science department ever had that I was fond of him. Talked him out of some bad pop quizzes, and managed to make him filibuster his way through several whole 2 hr class periods just telling me about his life. Honey over vinegar, always.
* If a class isn't limited by some resource that determines the number of spots (i.e. pottery wheels, computer desks, physical seats in the classroom etc) and you want into it, get on the waiting list and then just SHOW up to it.
   * On the first day of classes, show up to that course with a printed add/drop form and say you're on the waiting list (if you're first on it, mention that too, otherwise just say you're on it). Then ask if they would be able to add you. That max number of seats (unless determined by materials) is often set by the professor, and can be overridden by the professor. Trust me it feels weird, but the worst they can do is say, sorry no I can't let more students in. This shows the prof that you will actively participate, you're on top of things etc. Have the prof sign the add/drop and then immediately go get it put into your schedule at the registrar's office. In person. This never failed to get me into a course.
* Some professors, despite being professors, are noticeably better at teaching one-on-one than lecturing to a larger class. If possible, go to their office hours, or schedule a meeting with them to get help.
   * Usually you won't know until you try, so I highly advise trying. They have office hours for a reason. Bring a study guide, your notes, some part of the slides/book that didn't make sense. Being able to show them material helps a lot in getting a good explanation too. 
* If your professor is unavailable, or you don't gel with their teaching style but can't switch sections of the class to get a different prof, go to ANOTHER PROF'S office hours. Even if you like your prof, but they're busy or something doesn't make sense, try another person's explanations :)
   * Feels weird right? Surprisingly, most profs don't mind this. Don't tell other prof that your prof is bad, just say they're super busy today and I was wondering if you're able to help with X. Sometimes even if they don't teach the class they have in the past or they know the material. This saved me in O-Chem, on many many occasions. If you go back to them again, just say ""The way you explained.... really helped me understand the material better! So I wanted to ask about this....."". Those compliment questions will get you far.
* Befriend as many upperclassmen as possible, both in your major and out.
   * The ones that have been TA's often know how stuff is graded (we see A LOT of the rubrics) and the rest can point you in the direction of the good professors at the very least. The real heroes will sometimes even give you old notes. 
   * Especially in computer science this SAVED me more times than I can count. Newer students would ask the upperclassmen for help in the computer labs ALL THE TIME. And that student solidarity kicks in and all of the sudden the freshman that couldn't make their game render properly has a few of the best students in the major debating what could be causing it, and 10 min later - it's fixed. It really does take a village to survive college, so make sure you know the more experienced villagers.
* Stay ON TOP OF your homework. Especially in smaller schools where the prof might notice  if you don't. 
   * When life does happen and you need an extension, being able to say (with the gradebook to back you up) that you've worked really hard to stay on top of assignments and this is the first (or one of the few times) that you've been late on something makes a HUGE difference. I know homework sucks, but if its assigned there's a purpose. Even if its busywork, it's points you don't have to get later.
* Asking IN ADVANCE for an extension. Even if it's just the day before. 
   * Email your professor something along the lines of ""Hi Professor X, &lt;newline&gt; I had thought I could finish assignment Y for class Z by the due date tomorrow, but now that I'm partway through it I don't think I will be able to finish it in time and do a good job on it. Could I have a 24hr extension? &lt;newline&gt; Thank you, Cat"" or some similar variation if a health emergency or other impeding thing comes up. 
   * Always, ALWAYS mention being partway done since that is often the case and makes it about circumstances or not having enough time to finish (rather than a case of i-didnt-start-yet-oh-no).
* Have MULTIPLE advisors - at least one in your major and one in your minor. There are many many benefits, and most schools don't limit how many advisors you have.
   * If you get assigned a bad advisor at the start of freshman year DO NOT try to change and remove the original advisor. Especially if you will have to take classes from them. It can be seen as an insult and is hard to make fully inoffensive. If you have multiple though, they're not the end-all be-all of signing off on things for you. 
   * Multiple advisors means multiple people that can be asked to sign off on that last minute add drop form you need (saved me 3 times in the 2 years where I had two advisors).
   * Multiple perspectives on how to navigate the system, what classes are suited for you etc. Works especially well with two profs from the same department, especially if one went to school there or has been there for a long time. 
* CALL IN sick or missing class on important days or for classes that require attendance. (Mostly for small schools, where you know the prof)
   * Calling is the favored method of communication for many professors of older generations, so they'll often actually pick up the phone.
   * If you get voicemail, most (if not all) large systems like the university will have either send an email transcript of the message or an audio clip to the professor. They'll see it sooner usually cause they have to open it to see the contents.
   * Way better proof of needing to be out in a sincere little phone call than a short email. Especially good if you sound sick or in pain. Even if not, it somehow comes across less faked
* CALL your prof's office to see if they're around, or if their office hours are busy. Great way to get a quick question in without having to wait in a long office hours line, or hope your email gets seen.
   * If they're not there, decide if you want to leave a message or not. 
   * If they are there, and its office hours - ask if there's a lot of students waiting. If yes, ask if there's a better time to come in and talk to them, or see if you can just ask after class.  
* Course overrides are both a friend and a nemesis - they can help your schedule BUT make triple sure that you wont get too shafted by not having a requirement for a class you get an override for.
   * Some class pre-req's are actually a vague foundation that little to none of the material is based on, if you ask nicely some professors will sign you into the class and give an override of that requirement. Very useful, slightly dangerous. Apply with caution, and advice.

# Social and sundries

* Most schools have some sort of clubs fair in the first few weeks. GO TO IT. Look around, talk to people. No, no one is judging you for going alone, the whole point of a clubs fair is finding new groups of people with similar interests.
   * Pick a couple clubs that either interest you based on the people at the table, or on the actual topic of the club. Give yourself full permission to not like it and never go again, but go to the next meeting they have. People get that not all clubs are for everyone, I still have friends that I met in college freshman year just by trying out clubs. 
* The registrar's office is a vital place. A veritable hub of secret ways into classes that seem full. Always go in person when you need something, they know many tricks. They also have printed add/drop forms.
   * Remember the people that work the desk, they often enter course overrides by hand when registration opens, and if they like you, you may end up on top of the pile. 
* Don't feel like you HAVE to go to study sessions that friends invite you to. Sometimes they're wildly unproductive. 
   * I've never been one to learn well when there's a bunch of my friends in the room, so I would study by myself and occasionally go to study sessions to help friends or practice the material. Find your learning style and use that knowledge to be more effective in how you go about learning. Also, if applicable, tell your prof. Tell them that you're so sorry if you seem distracted in class, but you prefer to listen and doodle and then make notes from the text book later. Etc. 
* If you're unsure of when fun social stuff will come up PREEMPTIVELY do your homework.
   * Don't leave it till 10pm on a midnight deadline, only to find out everyone's meeting up in 15 min to go on some fun adventure. Do your homework between classes, before dinner etc. I did this all four years as much as I could and I got to go on a lot more last minute adventures than I would have. 
* IF you can manage it, have one day of the week as empty of classes as possible. Preferably somewhere in the middle. 
   * It gives time for errands, sleeping in a little, that essay thats due Friday, etc. Its a cushion day, and I recommend either Tuesday or Thursday since a lot of schools run classes that are MWF or T/Th. Tuesday is more for homework catch up if you know you're not a weekend homework person, and Thursday is more of a break in the week for the random stuff that comes up. At least in my experience. But consider it, its super nice just sanity wise too. 
* Consider getting a cheap monitor, keyboard, and mouse set up if you have a laptop. All you need is a usb hub and an hdmi cable to connect everything. 
   * Being able to have a reference AND your paper visible together is a beautiful beautiful thing. Or your math homework and Netflix, whatever floats your boat. 
* On a similar note, learn your context switching keys on your computer. Super helpful. See below for system:
   * Windows PC - alt + tab: switch between all open windows in order of most recent. Does not do it by program like mac. If it's open and separate it will be listed separately. Keep hitting tab to navigate on the little bar that pops up in the middle of your screen.
   * Mac - command + tab: switch between all open PROGRAMS. Will show the window for the front most open window of a program. 
   * Mac - command + \~: That's the tilde key, its right below the esc. This will switch between open windows of the program you're currently in. Like from the chrome window with my google doc to the one with my reference doc. 
* If you have a mac and HATE having windows maximized as much as I do, get the  [Spectacle app](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to be able to use a couple easy keyboard commands to pick which side of the screen a window is put on, etc. Basically a way to have it work a little more like windows. Highly recommend.
* Attempt to log into to the staff wifi network and see if your school's staff wifi is locked to students. The one at my school wasn't, and it was significantly faster. 

# Some health/accommodation tips 

I have a bunch of allergies and other health issues that meant I couldn't eat cafeteria food, got a room to myself and some academic accommodations. I am no expert on any of this, but I did notice a few things, and I hope they can help some of you if you face similar circumstances. And as I said before, I'm here if anyone wants to talk or is having a hard time adjusting to dorm/college life with health challenges &lt;3

* If you have documented allergies, you can ask the accommodations office if they'll give you an academic accommodation so that you don't have to take a test while having a reaction. I only found this out junior year, and it was EXTREMELY helpful. Don't abuse it, but not having to take an 8am calc test when you can only kinda walk and barely think is a huge relief.
* It doesn't hurt to ask - see if they'll give you academic accommodations if you have anything health related on file. Could be as simple as more time to get between classes, or getting to skip the waitlist for the only section of a class that isn't 8am because you can't get food from the cafeteria that early. 
* They will clean the air vents to your room if you ask. Dust is not good for anyone, even if you're not really allergic to it. Just call maintenance and ask, or ask accommodations if you have something related that they know about. 
* Regardless of what your school has on file, TELL your professors as early on as possible that you have health stuff that affects your x, y and z academically. You don't need to tell them what it is (and I advise you don't since they can't form as many judgements about it), I would usually just say ""health conditions and allergies"". Even if you don't have something official, they're more likely to be understanding if you miss class or need extra help with something. 
* I was able to not have a roommate all 4 years of living in a dorm, so know that's entirely possible for most schools to do and I would suggest asking about it if you have severe allergies or something else that would make it helpful. 
* Just keep asking for help, going to different offices etc until they give you the accommodations that you need.

EDIT:  I know this is a long post.  You've been warned.  Proceed at your own risk of losing 10 minutes of your life

&lt;Summary&gt;
During this last year I’ve learned that my wife has cheated on me multiple times (as recently as one month ago) for at least the past 2 years.  She has destroyed my credit, and continues to lie to me in virtually every aspect of our life.  My wife had some traumatic experiences growing up, which almost certainly contribute her perceived “dysfunctions”.  I've urged her to get professional help, and have gone to therapy sessions with her, but as soon as I'm deployed, she reverts to her old ways.  I am working on getting separated from her and separating our assets, but I don't know what else I can do to protect myself financially &amp; legally, and possibly increase my chances of getting custody of my son.  I’m afraid of what/whom she may be exposing him to, and I do not believe she is prioritizing his well-being above her selfish interests.  And, yes, this is a throwaway account.

*In case you couldn’t guess by the length of my “summary”, WARNING - This is VERY long*

**The primary reason for posting my story here is to glean some insight from those that have gone down this path, so feel free to jump to the last section if you just want to skip to the ??WHAT TO DO NEXT?? section at the bottom**

****The Beginning****

My wife and I dated briefly before I joined the Navy.  She was about to turn 20, and I was about to turn 25.  We reunited shortly after I was assigned to my first home port, in Charleston, SC, and began a long distance relationship.  While I was home on leave for the first time, we got pregnant, and she had a subsequent abortion because she didn’t want it to “limit her professional career”.  She didn’t so much discuss it with me as she did tell me that this was the course of action she was taking.  Since we were only dating, not even living in the same state, and I was only available to talk to her once every few days, I didn’t have much opportunity to talk her out of it, and then it was done.  This still haunts me to this day… 

It’s also worth mentioning that, during our long-distance dating period, she was letting me know about her regular socializing with her girl and guy friend.  I am not the “jealous type” but I was a bit protective.  She was a cute, young, funny girl, and was definitely fun to be around.  So, when I would talk to her, and she would tell me that she was having a party at her apartment, and there were more guys there than girls, it didn’t make me feel so great.  I didn’t voice my concerns, because I know how off-putting it can be when your significant other comes off as insecure, and/or untrusting.  This type of situation came up regularly, though, and I just couldn’t make myself OK with it.  There was one incident when one of the guys who lived in her apartment complex made it known that he had an interest in being “more than friends” with her, and she shred this information with me, which gave me some comfort.  I never placed blame on her for leading him on, because I wasn’t there, and eventually this guy stopped trying (or, at least I stopped hearing about it).

We maintained our “exclusive” status from 700 miles apart and eventually got married after about 6 months of dating. We got pregnant just a few weeks after we were married, and were both excited about it.  We believed that we were in a pretty typical situation, and stable enough to support her and a child, even with my impending deployments.  We knew that my income and the military benefits would ensure that they were taken care of.

*****Married with a baby in SC*****

During that first year, 2007, things were pretty good.  We had the standard newborn baby challenges as well as some common newlywed issues (cohabitating, dealing with each other’s annoying habits etc) but one issue that started become prominent was my wife’s general  lack of financial responsibility.  

She was less than two years removed from high school, and had only lived on her own for about 6 months before moving in with me, so she hadn’t had much time to hone money management skills, or deal with day-to-day independent living responsibilities.  I ended up micro-managing most of our bills and spending, while trying to impart as much of my knowledge as I could.  Unfortunately, she got very defensive whenever I’d try to explain things to her, and she would accuse me of “always thinking I knew better”.  Honestly, I did know better, but not because I was better than her.  It was simply because I had been on my own longer, had failed in the past, and learned from my mistakes.  She still was not receptive to my tutelage. 

As a result of her defensiveness, she began hiding money issues from me.  She maxed out a Target credit card, and would let monthly bills go unpaid while I was deployed.  Every time I returned home from a deployment, we had more debt, and nothing to show for it.  

******Move to Virginia******

After that first year, my duty station was changed to Norfolk, Virginia.  We moved into a small apartment about 15 minutes from base, and I resumed my regular grind (12 hour days on a rotating schedule with one 24 hour shift every few days) until the next deployment.  Luckily, some of the guys I had been stationed in SC with also moved to VA with their wives.  My wife socialized with the other Navy wives, and participated in support groups when the men were deployed.  She was also comfortable with socializing with some of my single buddy’s, which was cool because some of the other wives were very selfish with their husbands’ time, and wouldn’t even let other people come over to hang out when we weren’t all deployed. I was happy that my wife was OK with me having guys over to hang out etc.

Some of the guys would stop by and make sure she and my son were doing OK when I was deployed.  This was also a nice bonus, because it was known that burglars would often scope out the homes of military members and wait for a time when they believed the house was vacant, or there were just women home.

*******Lying and Spending*******

Every couple of weeks since as far back as I can remember, some little spending secret would come to light, and we would have a blowout argument.  She would get defensive, and act wounded, then try to turn things around on me and say that I am too hard on her, and that she doesn’t do it maliciously.  This is a common rationalization for her.  She does not understand that her lack of consideration is just as damaging as if she were doing it maliciously.  Either way, she was driving us further into debt, and damaging my trust.

I started to dig through our bank spending record, and web browser history.  I started to find a lot of online stores and eBay items in the history.  As I dug more, I found deleted Paypal payment emails for goods purchased on eBay (designer sunglasses, sandals etc.)  That’s when I realized she had a legitimate problem.  A compulsion or an addiction.  I wasn’t sure exactly what it was, but I knew we needed help.  I was due to be deployed for a couple of weeks, and pleaded with her to see one of the military-provided financial counselors while I was gone.  She promised she would, but never did.  She told me that she went for a “couple of sessions” but I later found out that she did not.

********Cheating*********

In the fall of 2009, while I was underway in on a 6-month long deployment, I was pulled aside by one of the IT guys on the boat who was responsible for handling all incoming and outgoing emails.  It’s actually part of their job to ensure that sailors don’t receive anything that could make them mentally unstable while underway due to the confined quarters, so all emails are scanned before forwarding along to the recipient.

Apparently one of the other sailors on the boat, MY BOAT, had been receiving emails from my wife’s email address.  I suppose it probably wasn’t the most sound of decisions to bring this to my attention, but I was friendly with the IT guys, and they knew I was a pretty level-headed guy, and they just couldn’t let this continue without me knowing about it.

So, they told me what they had seen, and it took me a while to really process it.  I asked for some details of clarification, and they provided me with enough information to make it perfectly clear that my wife was definitely having an affair with another guy on my boat.  This sunk my battleship… (couldn’t resist).

I did not remain level-headed, and I couldn’t even think straight.  I wanted to kill the other guy, or at least repeatedly smash his skull off one of the bulkheads.  I did not, however, act on my emotions, and I made it to the next port without incident.  We were receiving some alternate sailors at that port, and although I was scheduled to stay on the boat for the entire deployment, I was actually allowed to fly back to the USA from our current location.    This was a very humane gesture by the Navy, one which I certainly did not expect.
When I got home, I confronted her, and she acted very sorry, and upset, and promised that she would never do it again, and that she never meant to hurt me etc.  I wanted to believe her.  After all, we had a son, and I didn’t want to break up our family if this was a one-time thing.  I know how stressful our life was on her and families like ours, so I was putting a lot of stock in the idea that it wasn’t a problem with her, or me, but it was simply a nasty byproduct of a demanding lifestyle that left her alone and wanting companionship.

*********More recently*********

We continued to work through our financial and marital issues, and now it’s 2010.  There were a few more instances where her spending became a real problem, and we had more monumental fights in its wake.  She tried to get a job, but ultimately lost it due to “incompatibilities with other employees” at her workplace.  I still don’t know exactly what that means, but I have a feeling that she is much more responsible for her termination that she’ll ever let me know.  

I also heard some rumors from some neighbors that I had befriended over the past year that they had seen my wife talking with another local guy at a local establishment on more than one occasion.  I had met this guy that she was supposedly talking to on multiple occasions at group get-togethers, and I knew he had his eye on my wife, because he wasn’t too shy about eyeing her even when I was around.  When I asked her about it, she assured me that she had been somewhere, and he approached her a couple of times, but she never invited it, or encouraged it.  I had my doubts, but I had no proof, so I just stopped talking about it, and pushed it to the back of my mind as much as I could.

I have another long deployment coming up, and I can’t help but wonder what is going to happen at home while I’m gone.  I force myself to push those thoughts down, and try to be optimistic.  

While underway, I am receiving regular email updates from her, all positive things, she’s talking about all of the things she plans on doing with our son, and that she is going to stay on top of bills, and be conservative with our money etc.  It all sounded great, but I’d seen her put that facade up before.  She was always the type to post sunny and cheerful status updates to Facebook in the midst of one of our multi-day bouts about money, or responsibility, or priorities.  This always blew my mind.  It was like she would just escape to this fantasy world where all of her friends believed she was living in this married utopia.

**********My Last homecoming**********

When I arrived back home after my last underway (about 4 months ago) it didn’t take long for the bad news to hit.  I was picking up my car from a friend’s house where I had left it before deployment, because his house was in a more secure location than our apartment complex parking lot.  While I was there to pick it up, my buddy he let me know that I should go talk to the landlord, and that the landlord had witnessed some things that he felt should be brought to my attention 

I immediately went over to the landlord’s residence, and he informed me that he had witnessed a man, about my age, coming and going from our apartment very regularly throughout my last deployment.  He said that he originally noticed because he saw an unfamiliar car parked in my regular parking space for days at a time.  The landlord knew that I, my wife and my son lived in our apartment, and he knew who we were.  He even went so far as to confront my wife while I was underway and told her that he had a good idea of what was going on, and would not sit idly by and let it happen on his property.
I went back to the guy’s house where I had stored my car, and he begrudgingly confirmed the story, saying that rumors of it had been circulating around the community.  How embarrassing.  I was devastated, humiliated, and sickened.  When I learned that the man that had been frequenting my house had a criminal record and a pretty poor reputation around town, I was enraged.  I could barely keep tears out of my eyes as I thought about the state of my life, my fraudulent 	fraudulent marriage, and our very young, yet very observant son.

To think that my wife would be so selfish as to expose our son to something like this disgusted me, and it still does.

Of course my wife denied any foul play when I confronted her, saying that the car that the landlord war referencing must’ve been that of a repair man who came to fix the heat at the house.  I eventually convinced her that no amount of elaborate lying was going to convince me that she was not cheating, and to cut through all of this bullshit.  She eventually admitted to spending time with this guy, but never to anything more than a non-physical companionship, of course.  She was only going to admit to things that there was no denying.

I immediately packed up the few things that I needed, and checked into an extended stay hotel between our house and the base.  I began sorting through every banking statement and phone record from the past 6 months, just to get a framework around what she had been up to.  I had a friend pull all of her facebook status updates (because I was quickly blocked) and started digging. I needed to know exactly how much my wife had been keeping from me.  I had a feeling I still only saw the tip of the iceberg.

***********What came to light***********

-	She somehow caused damage to one of our cars that was parked in the parking lot while I was deployed, and had it repaired before I got home
-	She wrecked our other car (a Jeep) while driving in the snow, causing $4000 in damage (she told me about this one).  What she did not tell me was what my son told me.  While I was driving him somewhere in the car, we drove over a bumpy patch of snow, and I said “hold on buddy!” and he replied “do it again!” to which I responded, “No, that’s enough”, to which he responded, “I told mommy to drive over the snow, and she did, but then she did it again, and we went off the road and crashed”.  So, apparently my wife was taking instruction from our 4-year old when she wrecked our Jeep…
-	She purchased an iPad (not the base model either) for about $700, then proceeded to load it with hundreds of dollars in iTunes purchases
-	She failed to pay our telephone, electric, and gas bill for several months.  All of which totaled over $1000
-	She purchased a pair of Coach Sandals, several hand bags, numerous tanning sessions, and a lot of expensive dining out while I was deployed ($80 lunches… I can’t imagine it was just her and my son)
-	Was associated with, or knew about some criminal activity that her “boyfriend” was involved in, and is now obligated to several court hearings regarding this (I don’t know all of the details, but it involves the relocation of a firearm.  Awesome)
-	She opened a new line of service with Verizon with the SOLE purpose of getting a new phone at the subsidized price.  That’s it.  We now had an extra line on our account that we paid a monthly fee for, simply so she could have a new phone.
-	And perhaps one of the most mind-blowing acts since I’ve been home is what she did with the $4000 insurance check to cover the repair costs for our Jeep.  I kept asking her if we received the check yet, and she always said “no”. But, when I went to the mechanic to ask about the status of our car repairs, they told me “Oh, that’s paid for.  You’re wife already dropped off a $700 check for the Honda, so you’re all set.”  THE HONDA!?  That’s when I learned about the damage to our other car for the first time.  But then I wondered where the $700 came from, and why I didn’t see the transaction in our bank account.

It turned out that my wife had opened another checking account, and had the $4000 check deposited directly into it the week prior.  
After much argument, she finally gave me access to the account so I could move the money to pay for the Jeep repairs.  To my dismay, there was less than $1500 remaining of the $4000.  She had been SHOPPING with our insurance payment!

-	I had to go out on a 1 week underway for some testing shortly after my homecoming, and when I returned, she had spent the remaining $1500… Absolutely insane.
-	So, I’ve since bought her a $1500 replacement car so she has transportation for my son, and she is awaiting her mothers house to be livable again after a pipe had burst over the winter.
-	She says she is seeing a psychologist, and that “it’s helping”
There are so many other senseless lies, and so much more emotional abuse that she has unleashed on me, that I could continue writing for pages, but that pretty much sums up the highlights (or lowlights) of what has become of my marriage and personal life.

My wife is now living back in our home state with our son, and I am working on getting my next assignment sorted out.  I may end up in our home stat as a recruiter, which would mean very long hours (and work on Saturdays), but at least I’d be in the same state as my son, and could be there for him on short notice if he needed me.  It would also make it easier for me to see him on weekends if we end up with equal custody, but I’m worried that in a sole custody situation, the recruiting assignment may be difficult to manage, especially with my son starting school next year.

My other possible assignment would be in an instructing capacity related to my current field, which would have more relaxed hours, and help further my expertise in my field.  It would also be a better job for me if I was to somehow get sole custody of my son.

As with most things in the military, my next assignment is largely out of my hands at this point, and I’ll make the best of whatever I get.

Now, within the last month, since my wife has been living back inour home state, one of my friends noticed some very forward messages being posted on my wife’s facebook wall.  One of the exchanges went like this
-	(My Wife) Brrrr… It’s really cold in this big bed
o	(Other guy) Oh man, I’m mad that I didn’t come over now, I would’ve helped you warm it up!

That comment was deleted within 24 hours…  I got the guy’s phone number from our cell phone bill and called him.  I told him who I was, and what I suspected was going on, and explained to him that my wife was probably telling him something completely different.

The guy actually seemed like a decent enough person, and seemed pretty remorseful about the whole thing.  We talked for a while, and he told me that she told him “My husband and I have been separated for a year, and that it was completely over between us”, and started talking about the “future” with this guy she had only known for a couple of weeks.  Oh, and they had sexual intercourse after only a few hangouts.

After learning this, I became pretty emotionally detached from her.  Up until that point, I was still hurting because I saw a glimmer of the person that I had loved.  Now I know I probably loved the person she pretended to be, but never really knew her at all.

??????????????? WHAT TO DO NOW ???????????????

I need some direction on what I should do next:
-	What should my next legal course of action be?
-	How can I insulate myself from her financially?
-	What are my obligations to her financially?  I do not want to be looked up on as a dead-beat data, and I know she wouldn’t hesitate to play the “abandonment” card?
-	How do I help her and my son financially without giving her money that she can spend on frivolous things?
-	What should I be noting, or keeping records of to show that she is a destructive, selfish person?
o	I have copies of bank records, phone bills, unpaid utilities for up to 6 months
o	I also have a lot of friends and family that can vouch for my character and her lack thereof
-	What are my odds of getting custody of my son?  
o	I truly believe that, given enough time and freedom, my wife will seal her own fate by screwing up again, but I don’t want to risk that happening with my son in her care

I'm feeling pretty stuck at the moment (being honest, I have felt this way for a fairly long time) and I'm really not sure what to do with myself and my life... Yes, its a throwaway account because I wouldn't want my sob story too easily matched up with me.

So, I'm a 21yo UK male, studying for a degree in computer games. I'm in debt, I've got family problems, I think I might be depressed, but I'm not sure how I'd be able to tell.. Anyway, on to the problems.

***

**Problem 1: The Weed**
Been smoking weed for years now, on and off. I've always seen it as a fun thing, and I've only ever really smoked with mates, whether just me and a mate, or at a party, but only very occaisionally do I smoke solo. Sometimes I smoke it to chill and take my mind off stuff when I've got too much shit in my head, a lot of the time I just smoke it for fun. I can smoke with a mate anything up to like 3-6 gram between us in a day, for 4 days straight, or just have a couple of joints then nothing for a week or two. I don't smoke cigarettes at all, never have and never will.

I wouldn't say I'm addicted, but I do have trouble enjoying myself without it - especially recently as the shit has started piling up a bit.

The reason that this is listed as a problem is because I do realise smoking weed never helps. However, it's probably one of the only things I do enjoy doing these days. It's good fun and I'd hate to have to give it up.

***

**Problem 2: Health**
I'm not unhealthy, but neither am I the perfect picture of well-being. Last year I was diagnosed with GERD (acid reflux disease), and IBS (irrittable bowel syndrome). Now this kinda sucks - neither are life threatening, but both will be with me for the rest of my life. It's always bothered me since the symptoms of both popped up when I was around 12 - I'm always burping up acid, or struggling to talk due to trapped wind, suffer from random hunger swings (eating tons one day, to eating nothing, to moderately etc) though recently I barely eat at all, most likely due to stress. If I go for a shit, chances are I'll need another pretty much straight after, might even need a third after that. And it's messy. Then I won't need a shit for like, two days. Or maybe 4. Or maybe just til tonight. Or tommorow morning. It's pretty random, but also damn inconvenient because when I have to go, I do **have** to go. 

Edit: was also diagnoised with [Scoliosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis) when I was around 14. 

I've always been very shy, even as a kid, but in recent years have managed to start building my confidence up and sorting myself out. These days, I've slipped into the guise of an introvert - I struggle to socialize and I have very few friends, and only one close friend who I regularly hang around with. My confidence is very low, and my self-esteem is lower.

***

**Problem 3: Debts &amp; Money**
This is probably the cause of a lot of my darker thoughts. I have a £3.5k credit card maxed out, haven't paid the bills in like a year. It's probably around 4k now. I also have my old student account, with a £1.5k overdraft maxed out (ill explain this under problem 4) as well as several other misc debts such as an old gym membership, an old insurance policy and such that I owe around 300-400 to each, and a few other bits. In total, it all comes up to about £7.5-8k. I'm constantly worried about debt collectors, or god knows what coming to fuck my life up even more. I regularly get threatening letters through the door from various debt companies, but there's not really much I can do - how can I phone them regarding my debts, when I don't have any money for them?

Now, I've been in debt for several years really. Probably since I turned 18. I decided I wanted a motorbike to commute to uni on, because of the ridiculous train faires and so on. Not being able to afford the bike I wanted with my student loans alone, I was offered a pre-approved credit card by my bank and snapped the chance up. Two grand on a bike, five hundred quid on gear, and I blew the rest on booze. Big mistake, yep.

At first I was very good at paying it back, but when a bailiff turned up at the door demanding £700 from my mother, due to unpaid council tax, or he was going to start seizing goods (ie: everything in the house that was worth anything, regardless of who had bought it/owned it), I emptied my bank account to pay off her debt. This left me stuck to pay my bills, but I wasn't really worried. I let it slip a bit, and then when my bursary came through I paid off the last few months I'd missed and carried on, until I was skint. This is when I started struggling, really. My student loans would come in, I'd spend my money on whatever I wanted, pay some bills, then not leave enough to keep paying my bills up until my next student loan payment. I got behind on my bills, and stayed behind, the bills mounting up until I was at the stage where I could blow my entire student loan on my outstanding bills and still not have covered them. Needless to say, I wish I'd done that now, but I didn't and now I'm in even more debt.

It's got to the point where I can't phone the debtors, because I don't have any more nor any income to pay them with, and after having several nasty phone calls with them in the past, I've started having problems talking to people on the phone, I can't stop stuttering, I can't keep my thoughts straight and so on. 

***

**Problem 4: Education**
So, I'm an aspiring game developer - without a portfolio, as I've never been good at finishing projects, or simply lacked the necessary funds/time/effort/motivation to do so. I did freelance work for a while, several years back, but it was a struggle as it is to build a reputation in that world, and I got fucked over the several times when I did manage to find work, so I packed that in.

I'm generally seen as a very bright person, and I've always loved programming (tought myself HTML when I was like 10, and it just escalated from there), but I always seem to have too high expectations really. I never enjoyed high school - my second to last year, I was several hours late literally every day for an entire year. On my last year, I must've missed 6 months due to ""illness"" before my exams, but still managed to pull 8 GCSE's (which is pretty good, I guess).

When I went to college, I applied for a BTEC course in systems support. This was described to be programming, lab work, working with computers in the workshop, diagnosing faulty hardware - all that. It turned out to be two years of constant reports, A3 posters and powerpoint presentations on the various features of a keyboard, monitor, and so on. Very, very dull, boring stuff, and as you can imagine while my attendance was spot on at first, by the end of the second year I was behind in my work, rarely attending and in dire risk of failing completely.

I just about pulled through, managing to pack about 6 months of work into 3 days, coming out with an overall Distinction Merit Merit (DMM). Fairly good, secured me a place at uni at least, giving me the pick of any of the 5 different unis/courses I'd lined up for myself previously.

So, off to uni. I'd applied for several courses at several different uni's across the country. Eventually, I decided I'd like to stick close to home. My mother's never been very well, and me moving away would be a huge blow for her, so I decided to live at home and commute instead, and chose a course for a Computer Games Technology diploma.

The first year of my course was absolute shit. It was boring, druging, mindless work and 5000 word reports on various irrelevant and boring subjects. However, I was assured that this was just a generic first year shared by all the computing students, and that the second year would be much more course specific. I pulled through the first year easily, passing all my units with 90% or higher (the pass mark being 40%), apart from my Maths, which I scraped through with 41.5%. Never been my strong point, oh well.

Second year, absolute shit. I went from having tons of mates in the first year, to having very few friends in the second year - they just didn't seem interested anymore, or had other mates. Just one of those things. It was also around this time that I trashed my motorbike - insruance write off (not really my fault, some dickwad pulled out on me) - which was totally gutting, and began fighting for months to get some sort of payout from his insurer to get myself back on the road.

I found it very easy at first, but it never felt rewarding. If they asked us to build a basic top-down tank game, they'd let you work on it for like, a couple of weeks, then give you tons of code snippets to make life easier as the deadline approached. I also saw a fair amount of copying, tutors doing work for people and so on. Fair enough, but seeing as I'd already figured out all these problems for myself, and implemented A* path finding, random level generation, missions, upgradable tanks and god knows what else I could manage to pack into this crappy game made in a shitty engine, it felt a bit annoying that these people who put no effort in, or had no grasp of the subject at all, could still get decent marks because the tutors were doing the work for them, or they were copying off their friends. 

Eventually, my attendance started to suffer (due to the problems in problem 5!), and I missed a good few months, didn't pass my exams, and forgot to hand in several assignments that I'd actually completed to above-and-beyond standards months before. my own stupid fault, but I managed to convince the exam boards to let me stay on another year. Fuck it, it's not hard - may aswell get it over and done with and get the degree, right?

So, inbetween my failing of the 2nd year, and my re-starting of the year in september, I get a letter - ""Warning, your bank account is £1500 overdrawn."" - great. I phone my bank to find out whats going on, and it turns out because I was a student who failed the year, my overdraft was immediately and automatically cancelled. I tell them that I've been allowed to retake the year, can I have my overdraft back please? They fuck me around for a month, then tell me they can't. Great. So I open a new Current Account (can't get another student account until the other one is closed, and cant close it until the overdraft is paid off) with a different bank, and carry on life. Just more stupid debts to worry about. 

I did great with my re-taken second year up until about xmas, when my attendance started to suffer again and I stopped going in until fairly recently. However, due to so much time off, I don't have any friends at all at uni anymore, and I feel like a total loner every time I go in. I can't connect with the people in my class, they all seem so childish and annoying - their little giggle-fits about stupid nerdy little things really don't do much for me... even though I used to be the exact same as them :/

My problem now is that I'm very, very far behind, to the point where I don't know if I can catch up, nor if I even want to bother. I have like, two months left, to do nearly a years worth of work... and my problem is, the assignments and projects I've missed - I've missed. They're gone. I can only try to pass with whatever assignments are left available to hand in.

***

**Problem 5: Family**
I live with my mother, at the moment, and my older brother used to live with us. He's always been a bit of a dick, prone to temper tantrums and so on. If you don't agree with his opinion, then you aren't listening, or he's not shouting loud enough. And he is a very, very opinionated person. In to politics, conspiracy theories, and god knows what else. Totally not my cup of tea. He was also prone to smashing things, pounding on the doors/walls/windows/whatever when he was frustated, so it never really made for a friendly environment while he was living with us. I've never been afraid of him, really, but I've also never really been a violent/confrontational person, so I just let it go by. Discipline was up to my parents, not me, was the way I saw it.

So last year, my brother goes a bit nuts. Starts accusing people of some very random things, demanding answers about events that didnt happen, asking why we'd never told him his real name and so on, until he'd alienated himself from a lot of people - including myself, and my mother. This was the first sign to us that something might be wrong with him, and he might actually be ill... He ended up moving away to stay in his own flat, and decided to seek medical help on his own (we'd recommended it, but we couldn't force him, especially as he wanted nothing to do with us). Eventually, events long forgotten by me occured, and he ended up being sectioned - taken to a mental hospital. After he phoned my mum, she jumped straight back to his side, going to see him several times a week, spending money on keeping him happy and entertained in there, and fighting his corner to appeal, and get him out of there. Why? I don't know, I've never understood that. Eventually, he won his appeal and was released from his section, and came to live with us.

Several months later, relapse, and he's back in, after smashing our front door down, scaring my mum and gf (the only ones in the house at the time) to death and some other pretty nasty shit. Even after all that, my disabled mum went back to help him, walking to the hospital multiple times a week to take him bags of clothes or food or a PS2 or whatever. By this time, I didn't - and don't - want anything to do with him, yet she never seems to be able to say no, no matter how he treats her. I know full well, she does all she can to help him at her own and my own expense, then in two months times when he's been released, she'll just be ""a lying bitch"" and all that again, and we're back at square one.

***

**Problem 6: Job-search!**
Now, I know a lot of you are gonna say, just get a part time job while you sort your uni out, or whatever. Easier said than done. I spent months sending out my shitty CV to companies, never getting a response. 

I've never had a job before, being in continous education since high school, and I never did work experience. I never really attended very well in high school, college OR uni, so I don't have any professional references. This leaves me with a very blank CV.

Bearing in mind, I'm not just applying for games design jobs. I'm applying for jobs at tesco, jobs answering phones, jobs delivering pizzas, jobs stocking shelves, jobs in warehouses, all that. And getting nowhere. Again, the lack of motivation is killing me - I can't bring myself to start applying for more pointless jobs with a useless CV, when my confidence is so low that even if I do get lucky and get an interview, im 100% certain that I'd never get the job.

***

**Conclusion**
The last several years have been pretty tough, in general, but I've always pulled through. However, I've always had problems with motivation, and keeping myself motivated, but over the last few months it's all been a lot worse. I've never really been able to put weight on, but I've always kept fairly steady. However, now I'm losing weight fairly rapidly because I just don't bother eating anymore, half the time. Can't be arsed.

I find myself living day to day, I give off a strong ""don't really give a fuck about anything"" attitude and people seem (or used) to think I'm a fairly sound, chilled guy, but underneath I'm a mess. I can't drag my mind out of the shitter, all I want to do is have fun with my few remaining friends and forget my worries. In the back of my mind I always know that the longer I leave my problems, the worse its going to be in the end, when I do have to sort them out, but even that isn't enough to kick me into gear to sort things out. I feel trapped, most of the time, like I can't do anything to solve my problems. Yes, I could just do my best with my uni work, but to be honest, I can't be fucked with it. Yes, I could just keep applying for jobs, til I get lucky, but to be honest, I can't be fucked with it. 

I feel down every single day, and I can be totally fine one minute, and as soon as someone reminds me of one of my problems (ie: asking about my uni, or my debts, or if i can afford to do this or that) then my mood turns sour. the rest of my day is pretty much ruined because I just can't pull myself out of the shit moods once I'm in them. Or maybe I'll just wake up with my mind dwelling on shit, and that's how itll be for the rest of the day, especially if I don't have anything planned to take my mind off stuff. I don't know if thats a sign of depression, or me just being a fanny and worrying about shit too much.

I've been feeling disconnected with reality for the last few years, as if I'm living one big dream that I'm waiting to wake up from, but knowing full well it's not a dream. Yet I can't bring myself to really care about any of it. I get easy frustrated, while I used to be a very calm, patient person, and it seems like I'm turning into more of a judgemental recluse with a bit of a temper problem, and I don't really like it. I also feel I dwell in the past way too much - can't keep my mind off bad memories, no matter how upsetting or painful they may be - and I find it very, very hard to forgive and forget, which never used to be a problem. 

I could probably add several more huge paragraphs about my love-life, nearly being banned from driving, wanker of a step-dad and so on, but I don't think I will. Surfice to say I have a girlfriend who I love to bits, yet seems to be so self-centered and focused on herself all the time that she's not really a source of comfort. If anything she only adds to the stress with stupid arguements and childishness. I'm still biking, with 3 points on my licence (maximum 6 on a provisional!), and my step dad is no longer troubling us.

Anyway, tell me what you guys think. Ask me anything, but I can't gauruntee I'll give you an answer. I'm quite a private person to be honest, not that you'd believe it... any advice is welcome, any tips, anything. I don't know.",AskReddit,Am I fucked?

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly.

Instead, tell her to ""dress for a first date with a guy she really likes"". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion!|

[deleted],1341439776,/r/AskReddit/comments/w1tac/are_there_any_other_third_generation_holocaust/,"**First and second generation:**

My grandparents on my mother's side are Holocaust survivors. 

While at this point in my life I no longer subscribe to the religious aspects of that historical narrative, the survival mechanism, the flight or flight response, is deeply imbedded within me, and I imagine that this is the case for Ashkenazi Jews. 

That narrative of persecution (and of course, Jews are not the only ethnic or religious group to face that sort of thing, but bear with me) has seemingly shaped me in a way that is acutely aware of life and death, sorrow and pain. 

During the war, my grandparents each experienced their own psychological and physical torments; even now, in their 90s, they still suffer from it. 

No progressive steps to face that pain and agony. It's like witnessing a time capsule with two family members stuck inside that can't or won't break themselves out of it.  

It stunted their ability to become self-aware, empathetic, satisfied, and mentally sound people. 

What they lack in emotional intelligence they made up for in resiliency. 

**Unfortunately, they were incompatible, spiritually, emotionally, romantically--complete dysfunction, and incapable of loving one another--the loss and the pain and the unresolved emotions did not fade.** 

I suspect this will never change as they live out the rest of their days. 

They decided to have children. The oldest (call her Sarah) was born in Germany, and the youngest, ""Rena"" (my mother) was born in the United States. 

This second-generation was seemingly treading two worlds, the old and the new. My grandparents, based on the stories I've managed to extract from what little family members remain, were incapable of giving my mother and sister the love and support they needed to flourish as adults--as of now, Sarah is a living embodiment of the personal failings that came with the so-called first-generation/second-generation immigrant dynamic, wrought with tension and unfulfilled expectation, their expectations clashing with the reality of a miserable situation. 

They lacked the freedom to live their own lives in the shadow of this loss that had preceded them. This has caused some problems in the here and now: 

Sarah has never reached a point in her development where she released herself from those burdens. She never became her ""own person"".

**My mother**, on the other hand, managed to put some distance and space between herself and they; while she managed to 'get out', so to speak, she has still lived her entire life with parents who don't know who she is. In a sense, she was raised as a non-person. When you consider that, it is remarkable that she was as caring and nurturing to me as she was. 

What she (and I, through her) have gained through that strength and independence clashes with the lack of leadership with regard to family structure. True as it may be that my grandfather still remains our patriarch de facto, it does not change the circumstance. No one in my direct lineage, including my mother, has a clear precedent for child-rearing; though, to be fair, who really does? My mother never quite knew what it meant to have a real family, the result of her parents losing theirs some years earlier. 

**My father's** family immigrated to the United States nearly two generations before my mother's parents arrived. There was such distain between the two families; my father's grandmother generally referred to my poor, newly-immigrated grandparents as 'greenhorns', using derogatory ethnic slurs to make her point. Decades later, when my father's mother died, his older sister ""Betty"" declined to invite my grandparents into her home. Imagine that! 

There was equally as much tension and historically painful development in my father's family with consideration to the quick losses my father perceived at a young age. He witnessed his grandfather collapse on the floor and die in front of him at the age of 7, and lost his own father unexpectedly in his late-teens. We'll call him ""Ned"". 

My late grandfather (and Ned's father), ""Julian"", was routinely beaten by his father, ""Saul"". Whether or not Saul was re-channeling physical abuse committed to him is unknown. What I do know is that Julian failed to measure up in the eyes of his parents in his professional and personal life. 

We learned through chance several years ago, thanks to research that my older brother did, that Julian was previously engaged to another woman prior to marrying my late grandmother. This was a family secret. Why did the engagement not lead to marriage? 

It was because the family of his potential wife did not approve of his profession. They forced the break-up. He was forced out because he didn't make enough money. 

I will draw on this later for comparison. 

He married ""Ronda"", my late grandmother, who is the one person I know the least about in this context, as she was very secretive, and very closed-off, emotionally. 

Like her, Julian carried his own burdens silently. I suspect he simply wanted to retreat into his own mind without considering those things in his past. 

The result of that distance behavior manifested itself uniquely in their three children; ""Betty"" (mentioned above), ""Ron"", and ""Ned"", my father, also above.  

My late-grandparents placed such an emphasis on status, on keeping up appearances--whatever tension existed between the siblings was never dealt with. 

Age differences, personality conflicts, and a total lack of self-awareness and accountability shaped the choices each of the three children made. The siblings drifted apart, became passive-aggressive, and exerted a minimal effort to see one another over the last 25 years. 

Like his father before him, Ron was once in love with a woman whose family did not approve of him. Like his father (and remember, no one knew about this!), Ron was cast out. He never got over her. You can tell when the subject is raised, intuitively. 

And so he repeated the pattern of marrying someone who he settled for, and I imagine that marriage is understandably unfulfilling and empty, but that's pure speculation on my end. 

Julian never approved of Ron in the same way Saul did not approve of Julian. They pushed each other away, and Ron, in his late-60s, is still on some level harboring those feelings of sadness, guilt, misunderstanding, and anger. He is still fighting with his father. And this is why we never see him. We are perceived as subconscious emotional threats because we are living reminders of a life he has tried to forget. We all suffer as a result of this. 

In many ways, Betty is quite similar. She keeps a spotless home, but her marriage is one where she is domineering, controlling, and manipulative. She lacks genuine empathy and warmth. This of course is a combination of her upbringing as well as her personality. She has one son who I suspect will never marry and start his own family because she has spent his entire life smothering him. And he accepts it, even in his 40s. He is another example of someone who never developed into his own person. And yet, she could never admit this to herself. When you speak with her, you hear nothing but fallacies, blame, and projection. Neither she nor Ron are willing to be accountable. Neither she nor Ron have the capacity to understand this. Everything is always someone else's fault. 

My father, the youngest, will describe his childhood as one where he was materially comfortable, but out of place. He is a self-described 'anomaly' who never felt like he was a part of his family. He fought often with Julian, but to no avail--how could a man as insightful as my father show his own distant father anything? Julian had no idea what it meant to be a father. And because of that, he treated my father, and presumably his older siblings as non-persons, at arms length. 

It was as if he accepted their existences, but could not be troubled to be emotionally invested in their lives. When he died suddenly, my father was left to mourn his loss without any closure, and spent nearly a decade coping. His anger, rage, and belief that somehow his family was cursed fused with a general black-and-white world-view created a very bitter man who only now seems to be mellowing out as he ages--regardless of whether that anger has been resolved. 

He is self-made, but also very flawed. He did not have the luxury of having a father in the most critical years of his development. My father often says he has just wanted to be left alone his entire life--what he fails to see is that this is impossible. You might be able to live relatively unfettered if you get lucky regarding your spouse, your children and career, but life is constant change, and his reluctance to embrace that has also stunted his development in key areas. 

**Third-generation:** 

That was one thing my parents had in common; a total lack of leadership where it was really needed. It stunted their social growth in ways that I see today. Because they were so fearful of those negative influences, and because they were so wary of their own families, they tried to raise their children in a vacuum. 

Subsequently, home was a really stressful environment for me growing up without a proper support system. Because of this overarching emotional instability, I (the middle child, one older brother, one younger sister) and said siblings experienced a range of physical and emotional abuse in our early years. I believe my brother experienced the brunt of that physical assault. He seems broken depending on his mood. It pains me to watch it. My sister, her own struggles aside, has been in therapy for many years, and seems to be making a real effort to stop these patterns from re-emerging. 

As a naturally sensitive and introverted mind, I seemingly pushed out of my mind most of the torment that I witnessed. The strained, unhealthy, and downright dangerous relationship between my father and my brother put unreasonable and life-altering mechanisms on my personal development. And yet, as I look back on it, I had no idea this was occurring. When you're young, you tend to avoid taking a long-term view of anything, so without those reference points, I assumed what was going on in our family was normal, and I had to merely accept it. We have all suffered as a result of the clash in those personalities. 

As a result of that stress, I began to binge eat. I quickly gained a serious amount of weight, and this had interesting results. It started me down a long road. Poor eating habits and a lack of exercise lead to poor academic performance, leading to more stress at home, leading to more binge-eating, while all the while dealing with the fallout from the outright insanity that I was witnessing. How I managed to get through that is shocking to me, as I look back on it. Poor eating and stress lead to intense breakouts all over my body. I began to take harsh medications for it that did a lot of damage to my stomach. This in turn lead to me unable to feel good at any point during the day. This went on for years! What I didn't know was that my Mom went through the same thing. 

Again, another example of the patterns repeating themselves due to lack of communication and proactive assertion. 

I started to go through adolescence, and began to starve myself. Those underlying stresses relating to food went unresolved. My blood sugar was never where it should have been. My behavior was erratic and I was always unhappy. I began to drink heavily towards the end of high school for reasons I didn't understand. Thankfully, this never turned into anything more serious and I've never had a real problem with alcohol. 

I remember high school as a time where I had very little close friends. I felt very isolated, very sick, and very unhappy. This was still something I failed to recognize. I assumed everyone felt this way. Towards the end,  I was in a relationship with a girl who I was convinced would be by my side forever, yet subconsciously felt myself rejecting that idea, and was already beginning to consider cheating on months before I went to college. I remember kissing another girl  during that period of time. This was something I had also forgotten about. The angst that I felt towards the girlfriend after she cheated on me was real, but I suspect I was equally as upset at myself. Staying with her afterwards demonstrated to me at a young age that after that mistake, the relationship is dead. What a life lesson to learn at 19.  

I went to college and immediately began losing weight because of the stress and fallout of her choice.

But I was really lonely, and seeing how awkward I was with the girls who lived down the hall lead me to try and join a fraternity, which I failed to do my first year, but succeeded in the second. I was so desperate for friendship, and a fraternity full of Jews seemed like a fresh start for me. What no one seemed to understand was how dedicated I was to the fraternity. I used to cry (seriously) with happiness those first few months. I was so willing to give my all to something that meant the world to me. But this process was extremely stressful, and now that I was exposed to people who were abusing themselves in different ways, I too began to find my own ways of coping. I began to smoke marijuana, not heavily at first, as a means of sleeping better. 

But I now suspect that by smoking, I began to both raise these subconscious issues I had neglected (otherwise undetected in a sober mindset), but because I was high, I was unable to sustain any real progress and do anything about it. In other words, I was beginning to understand why I was doing the things I was doing, but was unable to stop. I needed help, and didn't ask for it. I was stubborn and failed to see the connection. 

Or, on the other hand, the use of the plant helped to put a temporary wall between my ego and my emotions, and allowed me the platform to understand why things happened the way they did. My relationship with the plant seems to ebb and flow depending on the month. Currently not smoking.

**If you've read this far**, you now have a fairly solid understanding of where I come from, how grateful I am that I didn't have to endure those experiences of the past, that the opportunities in this country are bountiful, and how inspired I feel at times to not ""make a difference"", but to act subtly and with good intent. 

But, with this in mind, I wanted to bring up some things I've been experiencing in the last few weeks:

I know too many people in real life on Reddit who if they came across this post would know exactly who this is--but, the profile is important. I'm 6'0, 200 pounds, not un-attractive in the valuation of the American pop-culture mindset (I mean, I've got Russian and Polish genes flowing through me here!), living alone in Brooklyn (for the last 3 years), a recent Master's recipient at NYU, and leaving for the Peace Corps to serve in Tanzania in October. 

I seem to be surrounded by people who value these accomplishments. Their excitement is palpable, but it feels incredibly hollow to me. 

And not just those resume building activities--everything. I've actually been in therapy since January, no clinical diagnosis of any mental disorders--so while I say that today I'm ""depressed"", I don't want to say I'm suffering from ""depression""--I want to kill myself, mainly out of not wanting to indirectly contribute to the suffering I perceive universally. I would rather sacrifice my consciousness instead of eating three square meals a day while some poor child, either down the street, or halfway across the world is struggling to survive. But it's not that I feel that I have ""nothing to live for"", so goes the cliche--it's just that life itself, for someone so sensitive and introverted, can be so unforgiving/indifferent that it really hurts to think about in full. 

I don't think anyone in my life really and completely grasps how miserable I really am. But I can say with full certainty that I wouldn't take my own life out of deference to said people--I should feel fortunate to have them, to have anyone to rely upon in this life--and again, this isn't because I think so highly of myself that I must survive in their lives--it's more that I don't want to contribute/add to their own struggle by taking the path of least resistance--but, is it fair to refer to suicide as the ""path of least resistance?""--I'm not married to that sentence, consider it struck. 

My life, as a whole, seems to be a poorly coordinated series of misadventures going back to some poor decision of appeasement. But is this really unique? Aren't all of us ""here by accident?"" 

I got to this point in my life through that combination of luck, timing, hard work, but sincerely feel that I have accomplished nothing. Done nothing. Am nothing. 

And I can live with being insignificant in the cosmic sense--I know that we're all there. But I loathe putting my own needs first knowing how comfortable my life really is (in the here and now, I mean) and believe that everything I do on day to day is a convenient distraction to push those burning questions out of my mind. Thinking about it too much is overwhelming. 

**1) Why pursue employment if this economy is built on the backs of the poor? It strikes me as a pursuit of social climbing to a miserable, lonelier existence, far removed from everyone. This country is the wealthiest in the world because it has become an international tax haven, a revolving door corporate entity within itself--because it has globalized key strategic resources around the world. 

How can anyone take pride or ownership of that? 

2) Why pursue school in 2012? A university education is meaningless if everyone has one (including advanced degrees)--and in this country, we willingness choose to go into thousands of dollars of debt, why? To propagate the myth of American exceptionalism, democracy? To get a decent paying job so you can afford to pay taxes, your loans off, et al? To live ""that life"", with a 401k, two-car garage, house in the suburbs, two children? (I'm thinking about the opening scene to Trainspotting right now, love that movie, but the message holds true--we do this…because it's expected? Because even though the statistics show a college graduate earns a higher wage than a high school graduate, what difference does it make if this entire country is in debt, the economy is never coming back, and if no one can find a job? Why find inspiration in the pursuit of knowledge only to have that curiosity marred by the nonsensical and almost backwards approach standardized education seems to have evolved into over the last 20-30 years? 

3) How am I supposed to reconcile serving overseas knowing that civilians in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Libya died in the last 48 hours from unmanned American drones raining down hellfire in undeclared, illegal wars? Do I tell myself that I'm doing this to further my own chances for success on all levels and turn a blind eye to the reality of it? And if I do this, how can I live with it without feeling miserable 24/7?** 

________

I have two relatively unstable parents, two grandparents experiencing PTSD, poor relationships with my siblings, but an awesome girlfriend (a healthy relationship, thankfully), and I can't help but feel overwhelmed at the benign indifference I've experienced over the last few years, living in this city. 

I can't wait to be done here. 

Thanks for reading. 


**TLDR: 25 year old white male residing in Brooklyn taking this July holiday to tell you a story spanning three generations with questions at the outset** ",AskReddit,Are there any other third generation Holocaust descendants reading this experience the feeling of universal pain and sadness? ,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w1tac/are_there_any_other_third_generation_holocaust/,1341461376.0,lack of emotional support from parents in college,22.51333333333333
[deleted],1341439776,/r/AskReddit/comments/w1tac/are_there_any_other_third_generation_holocaust/,"**First and second generation:**

My grandparents on my mother's side are Holocaust survivors. 

While at this point in my life I no longer subscribe to the religious aspects of that historical narrative, the survival mechanism, the flight or flight response, is deeply imbedded within me, and I imagine that this is the case for Ashkenazi Jews. 

That narrative of persecution (and of course, Jews are not the only ethnic or religious group to face that sort of thing, but bear with me) has seemingly shaped me in a way that is acutely aware of life and death, sorrow and pain. 

During the war, my grandparents each experienced their own psychological and physical torments; even now, in their 90s, they still suffer from it. 

No progressive steps to face that pain and agony. It's like witnessing a time capsule with two family members stuck inside that can't or won't break themselves out of it.  

It stunted their ability to become self-aware, empathetic, satisfied, and mentally sound people. 

What they lack in emotional intelligence they made up for in resiliency. 

**Unfortunately, they were incompatible, spiritually, emotionally, romantically--complete dysfunction, and incapable of loving one another--the loss and the pain and the unresolved emotions did not fade.** 

I suspect this will never change as they live out the rest of their days. 

They decided to have children. The oldest (call her Sarah) was born in Germany, and the youngest, ""Rena"" (my mother) was born in the United States. 

This second-generation was seemingly treading two worlds, the old and the new. My grandparents, based on the stories I've managed to extract from what little family members remain, were incapable of giving my mother and sister the love and support they needed to flourish as adults--as of now, Sarah is a living embodiment of the personal failings that came with the so-called first-generation/second-generation immigrant dynamic, wrought with tension and unfulfilled expectation, their expectations clashing with the reality of a miserable situation. 

They lacked the freedom to live their own lives in the shadow of this loss that had preceded them. This has caused some problems in the here and now: 

Sarah has never reached a point in her development where she released herself from those burdens. She never became her ""own person"".

**My mother**, on the other hand, managed to put some distance and space between herself and they; while she managed to 'get out', so to speak, she has still lived her entire life with parents who don't know who she is. In a sense, she was raised as a non-person. When you consider that, it is remarkable that she was as caring and nurturing to me as she was. 

What she (and I, through her) have gained through that strength and independence clashes with the lack of leadership with regard to family structure. True as it may be that my grandfather still remains our patriarch de facto, it does not change the circumstance. No one in my direct lineage, including my mother, has a clear precedent for child-rearing; though, to be fair, who really does? My mother never quite knew what it meant to have a real family, the result of her parents losing theirs some years earlier. 

**My father's** family immigrated to the United States nearly two generations before my mother's parents arrived. There was such distain between the two families; my father's grandmother generally referred to my poor, newly-immigrated grandparents as 'greenhorns', using derogatory ethnic slurs to make her point. Decades later, when my father's mother died, his older sister ""Betty"" declined to invite my grandparents into her home. Imagine that! 

There was equally as much tension and historically painful development in my father's family with consideration to the quick losses my father perceived at a young age. He witnessed his grandfather collapse on the floor and die in front of him at the age of 7, and lost his own father unexpectedly in his late-teens. We'll call him ""Ned"". 

My late grandfather (and Ned's father), ""Julian"", was routinely beaten by his father, ""Saul"". Whether or not Saul was re-channeling physical abuse committed to him is unknown. What I do know is that Julian failed to measure up in the eyes of his parents in his professional and personal life. 

We learned through chance several years ago, thanks to research that my older brother did, that Julian was previously engaged to another woman prior to marrying my late grandmother. This was a family secret. Why did the engagement not lead to marriage? 

It was because the family of his potential wife did not approve of his profession. They forced the break-up. He was forced out because he didn't make enough money. 

I will draw on this later for comparison. 

He married ""Ronda"", my late grandmother, who is the one person I know the least about in this context, as she was very secretive, and very closed-off, emotionally. 

Like her, Julian carried his own burdens silently. I suspect he simply wanted to retreat into his own mind without considering those things in his past. 

The result of that distance behavior manifested itself uniquely in their three children; ""Betty"" (mentioned above), ""Ron"", and ""Ned"", my father, also above.  

My late-grandparents placed such an emphasis on status, on keeping up appearances--whatever tension existed between the siblings was never dealt with. 

Age differences, personality conflicts, and a total lack of self-awareness and accountability shaped the choices each of the three children made. The siblings drifted apart, became passive-aggressive, and exerted a minimal effort to see one another over the last 25 years. 

Like his father before him, Ron was once in love with a woman whose family did not approve of him. Like his father (and remember, no one knew about this!), Ron was cast out. He never got over her. You can tell when the subject is raised, intuitively. 

And so he repeated the pattern of marrying someone who he settled for, and I imagine that marriage is understandably unfulfilling and empty, but that's pure speculation on my end. 

Julian never approved of Ron in the same way Saul did not approve of Julian. They pushed each other away, and Ron, in his late-60s, is still on some level harboring those feelings of sadness, guilt, misunderstanding, and anger. He is still fighting with his father. And this is why we never see him. We are perceived as subconscious emotional threats because we are living reminders of a life he has tried to forget. We all suffer as a result of this. 

In many ways, Betty is quite similar. She keeps a spotless home, but her marriage is one where she is domineering, controlling, and manipulative. She lacks genuine empathy and warmth. This of course is a combination of her upbringing as well as her personality. She has one son who I suspect will never marry and start his own family because she has spent his entire life smothering him. And he accepts it, even in his 40s. He is another example of someone who never developed into his own person. And yet, she could never admit this to herself. When you speak with her, you hear nothing but fallacies, blame, and projection. Neither she nor Ron are willing to be accountable. Neither she nor Ron have the capacity to understand this. Everything is always someone else's fault. 

My father, the youngest, will describe his childhood as one where he was materially comfortable, but out of place. He is a self-described 'anomaly' who never felt like he was a part of his family. He fought often with Julian, but to no avail--how could a man as insightful as my father show his own distant father anything? Julian had no idea what it meant to be a father. And because of that, he treated my father, and presumably his older siblings as non-persons, at arms length. 

It was as if he accepted their existences, but could not be troubled to be emotionally invested in their lives. When he died suddenly, my father was left to mourn his loss without any closure, and spent nearly a decade coping. His anger, rage, and belief that somehow his family was cursed fused with a general black-and-white world-view created a very bitter man who only now seems to be mellowing out as he ages--regardless of whether that anger has been resolved. 

He is self-made, but also very flawed. He did not have the luxury of having a father in the most critical years of his development. My father often says he has just wanted to be left alone his entire life--what he fails to see is that this is impossible. You might be able to live relatively unfettered if you get lucky regarding your spouse, your children and career, but life is constant change, and his reluctance to embrace that has also stunted his development in key areas. 

**Third-generation:** 

That was one thing my parents had in common; a total lack of leadership where it was really needed. It stunted their social growth in ways that I see today. Because they were so fearful of those negative influences, and because they were so wary of their own families, they tried to raise their children in a vacuum. 

Subsequently, home was a really stressful environment for me growing up without a proper support system. Because of this overarching emotional instability, I (the middle child, one older brother, one younger sister) and said siblings experienced a range of physical and emotional abuse in our early years. I believe my brother experienced the brunt of that physical assault. He seems broken depending on his mood. It pains me to watch it. My sister, her own struggles aside, has been in therapy for many years, and seems to be making a real effort to stop these patterns from re-emerging. 

As a naturally sensitive and introverted mind, I seemingly pushed out of my mind most of the torment that I witnessed. The strained, unhealthy, and downright dangerous relationship between my father and my brother put unreasonable and life-altering mechanisms on my personal development. And yet, as I look back on it, I had no idea this was occurring. When you're young, you tend to avoid taking a long-term view of anything, so without those reference points, I assumed what was going on in our family was normal, and I had to merely accept it. We have all suffered as a result of the clash in those personalities. 

As a result of that stress, I began to binge eat. I quickly gained a serious amount of weight, and this had interesting results. It started me down a long road. Poor eating habits and a lack of exercise lead to poor academic performance, leading to more stress at home, leading to more binge-eating, while all the while dealing with the fallout from the outright insanity that I was witnessing. How I managed to get through that is shocking to me, as I look back on it. Poor eating and stress lead to intense breakouts all over my body. I began to take harsh medications for it that did a lot of damage to my stomach. This in turn lead to me unable to feel good at any point during the day. This went on for years! What I didn't know was that my Mom went through the same thing. 

Again, another example of the patterns repeating themselves due to lack of communication and proactive assertion.

My behavior was erratic and I was always unhappy. I began to drink heavily towards the end of high school for reasons I didn't understand.

imaginary_account,1330757493,/r/AskReddit/comments/qfnie/how_do_i_deal_with_my_room_mate_for_the_rest_of/,"I'm in the second semester of my freshmen year. I live in a traditional style hall, meaning I live in a dorm room with one other girl. This girl is slowly driving me crazy. I'm going to warn you right now that this is going to get long, I'm terrible at being concise. I will try to bold important points or sum things up accordingly. *TL;DR at the end because I know how difficult it can be to read so much.*

**EDIT: You guys gave me the response I was expecting. I was hoping someone would go above and beyond and actually help. Go back to circle jerking and have a nice day if you aren't willing to help. Yes its long. Sorry...**

**We were random room mates. I thought she was really nice at first, everyone liked her and she was super agreeable.** 

After a few weeks I got to see how quirky and weird she is. I'm weird, too. No big deal, right? Wrong. Totally wrong. **This isn't the good kind of weird, its the I'm going to make you really uncomfortable and overstep every boundary you made with me and act crazy as fuck weird. On multiple occasions I talked with her about things that made me uncomfortable and she continuously overstepped those boundaries. After living with her I learned how fake she was, how judgmental and horrible she was. The problem? My boyfriend and I are the only people who know it. Everyone loves her, including our RA.** 

Lets start with last semester. We were pretty good friends, or so I thought. **She continuously disrespected me and my boundaries.** 

We have a couple of girlfriends who would spend all their time in our room. They didn't really have that many other friends they liked hanging out with, so we were the choice pick. I enjoyed their company, for the most part, but they constantly dissed our other friends and acted like we should only spend time with them. They stayed late when I had 8AM classes, they were very disruptive when I was working on homework. I constantly had to ask them to leave. Whenever I asked them to leave, they treated me like I was a royal bitch. After a while they literally started ignoring me when I asked them to leave. This was really stressful for me. I'm a very non-confrontational person and I try to be super nice and understanding... but **I was physically getting sick from sleep deprivation**. I was getting severe headaches, I had to skip class because I would wake up at 7AM only to black out in the shower. It was really bad. 

**So I confided in my room mate. She agreed that it was an issue and I asked that she made more of an effort to help enforce things with them. They never ignored her or treated her like a bitch when she asked them to leave... but she never asked them to leave. She continuously kept entertaining them and kept them over until anywhere from 1-3AM.**

One night near the end of the semester I ended up leaving the room crying because I just couldn't handle it anymore. You know what happened? One of my friends basically called me a bitch *as I was leaving the room crying*. After I calmed down I sent a text to my room mate apologizing and explaining the situation. She moved them to their room but stayed with them until 3AM, even though she pulled me aside earlier that night before I left and said that she wanted them to leave, too.

At this point I had recently got a boyfriend and was spending time with his friends every once in a while. They didn't start drama or treat me like shit because I had homework to do or I wanted to sleep. It just made sense to spend time with people who were actually nice to me. **That's when my friends started getting passive aggressive. We would discuss a movie and I'd mention that I had not seen it, only for them to watch it without me because apparently it was too much effort for them to send me a text or come get me.** 

The semester ended. I talked to some of my teachers about the personal issues I was dealing with and they were kind enough to overlook a few things and give me the grades I had worked for despite my absences. 

**I decided that this semester I was going to take things into my hands. I strictly enforced a rule where everyone had to leave the room at 11PM, including my boyfriend. I decided that if I couldn't get work done while I was in the room, I was going to leave so I could get work done elsewhere. I also decided to be fair to my room mate and friends so I told them ahead of time that I wasn't going to hang out much during the week but I would very much enjoy that we had movie nights or what have you every weekend.**

**This is how the semester unfolded.**

**Week 1: I follow through with everything I said I would do in the above paragraph.**  

**Week 2: I continue to follow through and I handle making the plans to hang out with my friends on both weekends and throughout the week.**  

**Week 3: I get swamped with homework and stay up until 2 AM most nights to stay on top of it. I plan a big get together for my boyfriend's birthday, invite his friends and my friends for a day out on the town as well as lunch at a local restaurant. We come back, I feed them cake and soda that I paid for with my own money and we watch the Superbowl together.**  

**Week 4: I get strep throat and I get 2-4 hours of sleep every night. I throw up my medicine. I miss a week of class. I had 3 exams that week, at this point I'm failing my classes. My boyfriend takes care of me because I don't like being a burden to other people and he's the only one I allow myself to be a burden on.**

**Week 5: My friends are treating me like crap and being passive aggressive for no apparent reason. My room mate is being petty and talking behind my back. I confront her about it.** 

Week 5 is where I'll pick up. 

First things first. Last semester my room mate didn't have class until like 3 PM most days and had no class on Friday, I had class at 9 AM and 10 AM every morning. When I woke up before her, which was every morning, I was like a freaking ninja. This semester she has class at 11:30 AM and 9 AM every morning. I have class at 10 AM and 12:40 PM. **This allows me to sleep in an hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays. ~~Being the respectful room mate she is~~, she wakes up an hour before me, passive aggressively slams her dresser shut, slams the door, crushes her water bottle and makes snide comments about me sleeping in and being lazy.**

**I had heard from a friend that my room mate had called me lazy for not taking out the trash.** This is what happened: Its in our room mate agreement that she takes out that trash. I ask her all the time if she wants me to take it out and she says no. I told her I'd take it out this one time because I had puked up my medicine in it, but it was such a side comment that I thought she didn't even hear me because she never acknowledged what I had said. I planned on taking it out but I was feeling like shit and had to study for an exam I was not prepared for and inevitably ended up failing, so it took me a while to get around to it. 

**I was pissed. I was crying. I was so tired of how she and my friends were treating me.** When I talked to her about it, she brushed it off and acted like it wasn't a big deal, like she was just joking about what she had said. I told her ""No, you have been treating me like crap. If you have a problem you need to talk to me, you can't just go behind my back and hurt my friendships with people."" Then she said, ""Well its a bigger issue than that."" **So I insisted that she tell me instead of talk behind my back and act so aggressively towards me. Doing so was not going to create a positive development in our friendship, it would only push me away. So she said that her and our girlfriends felt like I wasn't making an effort to hang out with them this semester. I stopped her and reminded her that talking to them (and I know how they talk, it isn't ""Oh gosh, I'm concerned about imaginary_account!"" like she made it sound like, its more like ""jesus, she's such a bitch. She never hangs out with us anymore. She's so lazy."" etc etc) wasn't going to change anything.** She needed to talk to me like we agreed in our room mate agreement.

**She continued to say that I was her best friend and how she realized the trash-issue was really petty and being passive aggressive wasn't okay, but she was just upset because she felt like she never had her best friend around because I was always hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends, or when I am around my boyfriend is around and she can't talk about certain things around him. This was an understandable situation and instead of arguing over how much effort I had put into hanging out with them this semester, I gave her a hug and told her I would work on it. I also mentioned that I felt it was unfair that she judged me based on 4 weeks, two weeks of which I was swamped with homework and had strep throat. In the future she needs to talk to me and she needs to make an effort to be forward about issues instead of passive aggressive.** 

Now, I understand where she is coming from. I'm an introvert by nature and I'm not used to people caring about me and wanting to hang out with me all the time. (My mom was really strict in middle school/high school and people just stopped asking to hang out because they knew they answer was no...) I don't manage a lot of friendships at the same time very well because of this. My boyfriend and I do spend quite a bit of time together, but I normally make an effort to tell him he should spend time with his friends so I can spend time with mine. At the same time, I always invite my room mate and occasionally our girlfriends to come hang out with us and his friends. They always turn us down, or when they do they ridicule his friends or complain about them afterwards. (They're not perfect but they're nice guys.) When the girls are watching a movie or TV series I don't really like, I still make an effort to watch it with them. **However, they do no reciprocate and its really annoying how they say I don't make an effort when I obviously have and they have not.** 

**So after we had this discussion, everything seemed to be better.** We talked for a good hour and a half, just about everything. We had a girls day out the next day (which, I guess they weren't planning on inviting me to until then!) and everything was better for a few days. 

**The next weekend, I asked my room mate if she and the girls would like to have a movie night and I would order some pizza. She stared at me for a second and responded, ""Oh yeah, sure sure..."" like she didn't want to.** Thursday comes around and I ask if she'd like to go shopping with me beforehand. She responds saying that she already made plans with one of our mutual friends to go to a sports game and she didn't know how long she'd be gone. I was a little upset. **Was she blowing off our plans to watch the movie? Did she even relay the message to our girlfriends like I had asked her to? The answers respectively: yes and no.** 

She invited one of our girlfriends to the sports thing and they didn't get back until fairly late in the evening. I spent most of the evening chatting with the other girlfriend and I mentioned the movie, which apparently my room mate had never mentioned like I had requested. When they got back, the other girlfriend said to my room mate, ""Oh didn't you want to watch a movie?"" like it had been her idea. **My room mate then made a very aggressive comment towards me saying that they couldn't because I had homework.** I was just thinking, excuse you? I told them that it was my idea in the first place. I made the commitment, I wasn't going to blow them off to do homework.

The next night she had a date. (**Side note: My room mate is a horrible person who leads guys on and refuses to make a commitment. She knows she doesn't want to make a commitment, but she keeps flirting with my guy friends and hurting them. She has hurt many of my guy friends this way, to the point where I finally just have to tell my guy friends its a bad idea.**) I spent that night hanging out with the girlfriends. She didn't get back until 5AM. **I spent that entire Sunday doing homework until 2AM, because I had put it all off to make time for my girlfriends. I missed a homework assignment and wasn't able to finish a 5 page essay I had due the next day because I sacrificed so much time for them. I don't blame them at all, it was my decision. But if my room mate says I'm not making an effort...**

**At this point, I feel like I've patched things up with the girls, sort of. My room mate keeps making plans with them, then not inviting me. I have a sneaking suspicion that the girls think I was actually invited and that I am just ditching them. Outside of my room mate, I make sure to try and hold conversations with them and hang out with them when I can. They have improved their behavior since last semester and have become much more respectful.**

**But my room mate... she's treating me passive aggressively again. She's talking behind my back again. She's making snide comments. She keeps making plans with the girls and then doesn't invite me.**

I have a friend who recently went through a break up with his girlfriend of two years, and he's taken a liking to my room mate. What does my room mate do? She starts flirting with him when she thinks he's weird and creepy. **She starts talking to him and she tells him I'm lazy and I don't do my homework! He brought it up to tease me but that's really crossing the line. There has been a trend of her talking to my friends independently and making rude comments about me, to the point where I feel like she's trying to separate me from some of my friends.**

**Today I broke down and cried in front of her. I just can't handle the stress. She's stressing me out and trying to ruin my friendships, my 13 year old dog back home might be put down soon, I'm failing my classes. I only told her about my dog and the classes. You know what she said? ""Oh, you just need to step it up... you need to study more and do your homework."" Which was her way of telling me she thinks I'm lazy, not doing enough work. Are you kidding me?** 

**I'm taking 17 credit hours, taking Astrophysics classes (mind you its been 3 years since I've taken a math class so I'm struggling to remember everything), and I'm in the Honors program. If I fail my classes, I lose my scholarships. My family can't afford to put me through college. My mom isn't even paying for any of this, all of it is scholarships and loans that she is making me pay off after college. If I lose my scholarships, I go back home to a verbally/emotionally abusive mother. *That is my worst nightmare*. My room mate thinks she has the authority to judge me and say that I'm not working hard enough when I have so much at stake. Who does she think she is?**

I just feel like my room is so hostile with her in it. **I can't do anything without being judged. I don't trust her anymore, and I know she's constantly talking behind my back. She takes out her anger on me. She's a horrible person and I don't want to deal with this anymore. I need to focus on my school work! I don't want to talk to our girlfriends about it because I feel like that's talking behind her back and at least I have some respect for her and refuse to do that. I can't talk to my RA because she's become good friends with her and the RA thinks she's the nicest person in the world and I'm almost certain she's already talked crap about me to the RA. I can't just stop spending time in my room because then she will justify treating me like crap with the fact that I'm ""not making an effort"". I've already tried making an effort, to the point where it was affecting my grades, but obviously it wasn't enough for her because she's back to treating me like crap. I don't want to talk with her about it because she's just going to ""deny, deny, deny"" and I'm really bad at articulating myself in confrontations.**

*I apologize for this being so long, I hesitated to post it due to its length... I just don't know what to do. I've exhausted my resources. I've talked to my mom and boyfriend about it, but only them because I feel like talking to anyone else would be disrespectful to my room mate. They both said they think she is jealous and I either have to talk to her (where she will ""deny, deny, deny"") or deal with it... has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Is there anything I can do that will ease the situation? Thanks in advance.*

**TL;DR** *My room mate calls me her best friend and justified treating me like crap and talking behind my back with the fact that I wasn't ""making an effort"" to hang out with her and the girls, even though I most definitely was. I told her I'd try harder, which I did and she is continuing to talk behind my back and treat me like crap even though I've done nothing but be respectful. She is a bad person who hurts my guy friends by flirting with them and leading them on, being two faced, being disrespectful and tries to hurt my friendships with other people. She has the RA wrapped around her finger and I don't know how to handle the situation anymore. I just want to pass my classes and finish the semester so I can get a new room mate next semester.*",AskReddit,How do I deal with my room mate for the rest of the semester?,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qfnie/how_do_i_deal_with_my_room_mate_for_the_rest_of/,1330779093.0,i can't afford a dorm,21.96
imaginary_account,1330757493,/r/AskReddit/comments/qfnie/how_do_i_deal_with_my_room_mate_for_the_rest_of/,"I'm in the second semester of my freshmen year. I live in a traditional style hall, meaning I live in a dorm room with one other girl. This girl is slowly driving me crazy. I'm going to warn you right now that this is going to get long, I'm terrible at being concise. I will try to bold important points or sum things up accordingly. *TL;DR at the end because I know how difficult it can be to read so much.*

**EDIT: You guys gave me the response I was expecting. I was hoping someone would go above and beyond and actually help. Go back to circle jerking and have a nice day if you aren't willing to help. Yes its long. Sorry...**

**We were random room mates. I thought she was really nice at first, everyone liked her and she was super agreeable.** 

After a few weeks I got to see how quirky and weird she is. I'm weird, too. No big deal, right? Wrong. Totally wrong. **This isn't the good kind of weird, its the I'm going to make you really uncomfortable and overstep every boundary you made with me and act crazy as fuck weird. On multiple occasions I talked with her about things that made me uncomfortable and she continuously overstepped those boundaries. After living with her I learned how fake she was, how judgmental and horrible she was. The problem? My boyfriend and I are the only people who know it. Everyone loves her, including our RA.** 

Lets start with last semester. We were pretty good friends, or so I thought. **She continuously disrespected me and my boundaries.** 

We have a couple of girlfriends who would spend all their time in our room. They didn't really have that many other friends they liked hanging out with, so we were the choice pick. I enjoyed their company, for the most part, but they constantly dissed our other friends and acted like we should only spend time with them. They stayed late when I had 8AM classes, they were very disruptive when I was working on homework. I constantly had to ask them to leave. Whenever I asked them to leave, they treated me like I was a royal bitch. After a while they literally started ignoring me when I asked them to leave. This was really stressful for me. I'm a very non-confrontational person and I try to be super nice and understanding... but **I was physically getting sick from sleep deprivation**. I was getting severe headaches, I had to skip class because I would wake up at 7AM only to black out in the shower. It was really bad. 

**So I confided in my room mate. She agreed that it was an issue and I asked that she made more of an effort to help enforce things with them. They never ignored her or treated her like a bitch when she asked them to leave... but she never asked them to leave. She continuously kept entertaining them and kept them over until anywhere from 1-3AM.**

One night near the end of the semester I ended up leaving the room crying because I just couldn't handle it anymore. You know what happened? One of my friends basically called me a bitch *as I was leaving the room crying*. After I calmed down I sent a text to my room mate apologizing and explaining the situation. She moved them to their room but stayed with them until 3AM, even though she pulled me aside earlier that night before I left and said that she wanted them to leave, too.

At this point I had recently got a boyfriend and was spending time with his friends every once in a while. They didn't start drama or treat me like shit because I had homework to do or I wanted to sleep. It just made sense to spend time with people who were actually nice to me. **That's when my friends started getting passive aggressive. We would discuss a movie and I'd mention that I had not seen it, only for them to watch it without me because apparently it was too much effort for them to send me a text or come get me.** 

The semester ended. I talked to some of my teachers about the personal issues I was dealing with and they were kind enough to overlook a few things and give me the grades I had worked for despite my absences. 

**I decided that this semester I was going to take things into my hands. I strictly enforced a rule where everyone had to leave the room at 11PM, including my boyfriend. I decided that if I couldn't get work done while I was in the room, I was going to leave so I could get work done elsewhere. I also decided to be fair to my room mate and friends so I told them ahead of time that I wasn't going to hang out much during the week but I would very much enjoy that we had movie nights or what have you every weekend.**

**This is how the semester unfolded.**

**Week 1: I follow through with everything I said I would do in the above paragraph.**  

**Week 2: I continue to follow through and I handle making the plans to hang out with my friends on both weekends and throughout the week.**  

**Week 3: I get swamped with homework and stay up until 2 AM most nights to stay on top of it. I plan a big get together for my boyfriend's birthday, invite his friends and my friends for a day out on the town as well as lunch at a local restaurant. We come back, I feed them cake and soda that I paid for with my own money and we watch the Superbowl together.**  

**Week 4: I get strep throat and I get 2-4 hours of sleep every night. I throw up my medicine. I miss a week of class. I had 3 exams that week, at this point I'm failing my classes. My boyfriend takes care of me because I don't like being a burden to other people and he's the only one I allow myself to be a burden on.**

XleepyJoeBenzo,1588816543,/r/college/comments/gexlp1/how_my_dorm_became_a_dr_g_superhighway_this_story/,"The year was 2012, and we were all supposed to die in December. It was my freshman year of college. I was settling in quite well. I made friends with a bunch of people in our residence hall, we hit it off immediately. We started going out on the weekends, starting with thirsty Thursday, which turns out is actually a thing. I had more than one room mate. We lived in a four person suite with two bedrooms. I had a full ride to my University, so I had a lot of extra money to spend on my living arrangements and meal plan. Oh yeah, I was also a huge pothead.

I made friends with the dealer on my floor and started buying him extra meals in exchange for weed. That's when one of my room mates came to me with a proposition. He asked me if I knew what bitcoins were. I did not. He explained the virtual currency and how it worked. Then he really laid it all out. He told me that he had quite a lot of bitcoins and that he wants to get into selling weed. It all sounded great, but I wasn't sure what he needed me for. He then told me that he doesn't really talk to anyone and that he always sees me with people and going to parties every weekend. Okay, this makes sense. He told me how the operation would work, and it sounded swell. For the record, I was eighteen and very stupid. Anyway, he would purchase the products from the Silk Road, a dark website where you can buy literally fucking anything. Our friend Noah would then get the goods delivered to his apartment, which had a mailroom with hundreds of mailboxes. This was good because it would be just a little bit less suspicious, also his apartment was not on our campus. Then we'd package everything there and move it to our dorm, which had it's own security. We lived in North Philadelphia, so the security and police were always looking out for the students. After we safely had the products, I would find the buyers.

Our first shipment went well. We ordered a half pound of weed, a gram of hash, ten hits of LSD, a small bag of opium (for us), and 1000mg of Alprazolam extract for my room mate's personal anxiety treatment. We got into this business to become weed salesmen. That weed took forever to sell. Everyone who sold weed already had good connections from their hometowns. The LSD though, that sold in five fucking minutes to one buyer who was interested in buying much more than ten hits. He asked us if we could sell him a couple hundred tabs. He said he'd pay $350 for each sheet of 100. We looked at the price per sheet on the Silk Road. It would cost us only $80 each. Yes sir, we can absolutely sell you a couple sheets. We told him we'd call him when it arrived. Later that night we brewed some opium tea and celebrated entering the LSD business. We bought the sheets for him, and we also bought two extras in case anyone else wanted some.

The next shipment came with no problems. Our friend came over and bought the sheets we had promised him. We made nearly $800 on that deal. We thought that was a lot, so we celebrated. Later that same day, while smoking a blunt in our courtyard, I made friends with some art students. They invited me to their dorm on the third floor. I agreed, went with them, and we listened to music and painted the walls of the dorm room which was super against the rules. They started talking about how they had taken magic mushrooms two weeks before and how it was life changing. I told them I had two-hundred hits of acid in my room. I've never seen people get so excited in my entire life. They bought all of it. They paid $400 for each sheet. Seemingly out of nowhere we made $600. Again, we thought this was a lot.

My room mate was really happy with my networking abilities. Dude, I was just getting high with some hipster art students. I didn't really possess the ""networking skills"" that everyone thought I had. We went online and purchased another five sheets. We started getting a bit more confident in our ability to sell this magic money making paper. That week I was in one of my classes and had to do a group project with a kid named Eddy. We went to his apartment to work on the project after class. Eddy had an apartment off campus because he was an upperclassman. On the way he asked if I smoked weed. Of course. He said he had something to show me. When we got there he showed me a small weed plant he was growing. It was an adorable little plant in a flower pot by the window. I asked if he needed any weed and he said that he did not. We smoked a bit and then her offered me a Xanax. I had never taken Xanax, so I googled the pill he offered me. Alprazolam. Huh, that's funny. I told him I had 1000mg of alprazolam in my room. This excited him.

I asked my room mate if he was willing to sell some of his private stash. Eddy only wanted to buy around 100 milligrams. He agreed and I brought Eddy to my dorm. We gave it to him for the cool price of $150, a slick markdown from what he was paying. After all we hadn't even planned on selling that stuff. He asked how we got it so cheap and if we could get anything else. We told him that we sell LSD. He said he loves hallucinogens and would love to purchase a sheet, so he did. Four sheets left. If we sell them, we can get a new and faster computer.

The weekend came and I was hanging out with two of my friends from our residence hall. Joe, who was really chill and loved smoking weed as much as I did. And Bianca, who was so cool that it frightened me. She was really intimidating. I had a huge crush on her, but she was ""talking"" to a kid that lived in Johnson and Hardwick hall. Bianca was the type of person you see in movies about cool kids doing cool things. A character who has a lot of depth, but it takes nearly the whole movie to slowly peel back the layers, and by that time you're in love. I told her if we sold the rest of our acid I'd buy her a new tattoo. She was covered in them. That night Joe was going to take us to his friend Jamie's house. We were going to try cocaine for the first time. I was terrified. Not only was I terrified about trying cocaine, but I was scared of doing it with Bianca. I just didn't know how I would act, and I didn't want to do something stupid.

We arrived at Jamie's house. Jamie was also intimidating. His house was what your typical trap house looked like at the time, with a bunch of really expensive music equipment. Everybody wanted to be a rapper or a D.J. that year. He introduced all his friends and offered us lines of coke. Here we go. Joe went first, he'd already done some before. Bianca went next without hesitation. Now it was my turn. I remember my hand shaking with the rolled up bill between my fingers. I chose the smallest line and sniffed. It did not taste anything like I expected. Five minutes went by. Oh, this is what cocaine is like. It was so underwhelming. It was also some thoroughly stepped on shit. I know that now because since then I've done some foreign blow that literally almost made my heart stop. Anyway, Jamie and I got to talking, mostly about his ""music career"". Jamie told me if I ever wanted to buy cocaine in bulk to hit him up. I laughed and told him if he ever wanted to buy LSD in bulk to hit me up. I was half joking. He looked at me with the straightest face and asked if I was serious. Honestly, this Jamie guy really scared the shit out of me. He was a good ten inches taller than me and the whole scene was really starting to freak me out. I told him I was serious though. He told me to come with him.

He brought me into his room and closed the door. In the room it was quiet. The walls were sound proofed. I looked around and the room was full of money, cocaine, and guns. Okay, he's probably not going to kill me. I hope. He then asked about my LSD connection. I told him I could get sheets for $350. He said he wanted books. Books? This guy wants books? I didn't know this at the time, but a book is a thousand hits of LSD. I told him I had to talk to some people and I would let him know the price, but that I could definitely make it happen. We went back into the party and he gave me line after line of cocaine. Joe offered him money for the lines, but Jamie told him not to pay. He said your friend here bought you guys as much coke as you want for the night. Honestly, that made me feel really cool. After the party I talked to my room mate and told him what happened. We looked up the price of a book on the Silk Road. $300. Not only could we have saved a lot of money if we had just bought a book from the start, but we were going to make a lot more money selling by the book. The days of getting excited over $800 were about to come to an abrupt end.

I talked to Jamie and asked how much he would be willing to pay for each book. He said he would pay no more than $3000 for each book. We decided we would sell him the books for $2,800 each. He agreed and asked how many we had. I said we can start with five books. He agreed. This was perfect. Not only were we about to make more money than we had ever expected, but acid was incredibly easy to ship. They were basically sheets of paper. Our supplier used to send it to us in between the pages of large children's coloring books. The books, or prints, as our supplier called them, blended with the kid's books very well. Our prints consisted of a large picture of Bart Simpson, The Grateful Dead bears, and a double rainbow portrait. If you didn't know what acid was, you wouldn't know these were dr\*gs. We made nearly $14,000 from that first deal.

Over the course of a few months we would sell close to thirty-thousand hits of LSD. We had $75,000 in cash sitting in an empty bedroom at Noah's apartment. I stopped going to class. My room mate had filled his entire room with computer parts and instruments. Noah, well we didn't really see him much, but he was always present when we needed a shipment. We broke our cardinal rule of not getting high on our own supply. We took a lot of acid that semester. It was an extremely enlightening period for us. Things in my world began to take on entirely new meaning. I had a newfound appreciation for things I had never noticed. The connections with my friends became very strong and we talked about a lot of stuff that was just too deep for my other peers to even scratch the surface of. It was nice.

By my birthday in February we had over $200,000 in cash. We didn't die in December, not that I thought we would, but some people were legitimately surprised. They were mostly art students. Things started getting a little crazy. My room mate and I were taking a lot of Xanax by this time and a lot of nights celebrating were never logged as memories. We always told ourselves we would only sell LSD. We had sparked a huge psychedelic scene in and around Philadelphia. There were literally parties where everyone was tripping acid. Many groups of people began taking acid and doing really creative stuff that I admired so much. So much good music and art was around during that period. I felt like I was living in San Fransisco in the middle 60's. It felt like we were part of this incredible scene that nobody outside of the city knew about. Of course every wave has to break and roll back.

It was getting close to the summer. I hadn't been to class in months. We hadn't seen Noah since the previous shipment about a month prior. It was a regular weekday, but I wasn't going to class, so I took two hits of acid. I spent most of that evening and night writing and yapping into my tape recorder. I was on the subject of togetherness and how there are so many things that are so incredible that we never notice even though they're right in front of us. Acid talk. I was looking at a glass of water, thinking about its importance, and how so many of us take it for granted. That's when my room mate came home. This was *my* room mate though. Remember, we had a two bedroom, four person suite. *My* room mate, who was never involved in our operation. He was obliterated, and not from alcohol. This was something else. He limped into the room and collapsed on the bed. I immediately got the rest of my room mates together. That's when Christian told me what transpired earlier while I was locked in the bedroom tripping acid. He told me that my room mate had broken up with his girlfriend, took an entire bottle of lorazepam, and tried to cut his leg open with my biology scalpel. What the fuck.

I examined his leg and he did not *try* to cut it open, he succeeded. He had a gigantic cut all the way down his lower leg that was fixed up by his father who is a surgeon. His father then brought him back to the dorm. The condition he was in was terrifying. He was breathing, but not well. His heart rate was also very low and we had to monitor him for the remainder of the night, taking shifts to make sure he didn't stop breathing. I couldn't believe his father had brought him back in the condition he was in. The next morning I was exhausted. My room mate and I, the one with the bitcoins, left and went to Noah's apartment to relax for an hour. While we were gone Bianca was to watch over him with her room mate. When we got to Noah's we had a new problem. Noah hadn't gotten out of bed for what looked like weeks. He had ran out of his antidepressants and was in bad shape. At this point I checked out. I walked into the living room and opened a bottle of champagne. I poured a glass, popped a Xanax, and sat on the sofa. I was still a little foggy from my acid trip and I hadn't slept all night. That's when my phone rang. It was Bianca.

I answered the phone and her first words were: ""Your room is full of police."". Well, it's been a good run. On my desk were a couple thousand hits of LSD and a handgun. In the other bedroom were numerous unopened box's of expensive computer parts, scales and paraphernalia galore, and a large pile of white powdered alprazolam. That room also smelled heavily of weed because there was a half pound out in the open. We had gotten very sloppy. I asked her if my room mate was okay. She said that's why the police are there. She said his mom was trying to reach him and he wasn't answering her, so she called the police for a wellness check. Bianca then started talking to someone and hung up the phone.

We pondered whether or not to flee the country and become outlaws. We did after all have all the cash here at Noah's. Close to a million dollars. Maybe more. Because we were getting sloppy, we had also started selling hash, Xanax, LSD, 25i-NBOMe, 2c-b, 2c-i, 2c-E, Mescaline, cocaine, MDMA, MDA, LSA, clonazepam, ativan, and other various designer chemicals. We were going down for a long time. I started thinking about my life. It literally was flashing before my eyes. I thought about my high school crush, and how I should have been more upfront with her about how much I liked her. I loved her. I thought about the time we slept in the same bed and I couldn't fall asleep because I couldn't believe she was really laying next to me. I remembered how I never wanted to wake up next to anyone else. I thought about my trivial crush on Bianca and how shallow it really was. I thought about my parents and how they'd raised me better. How they did so much for me so that I could go away to college and have a better life than they had. I thought about sitting on the beach last summer without a care in the world. The ""problems"" in my life that seemed hilarious now. Will I go to prom? Is my car cool enough? My k/d ratio in Call of Duty. How could so much happen in less than a year? That's when Bianca called me again.

I was terrified to pick up that phone. We looked outside to see if police were surrounding the apartment complex. They were not. I answered the phone. She said the police were gone. She had put my gun and LSD in my desk drawer. The police never entered the other bedroom. It was just a wellness check. An ambulance came and took my room mate. He was going to be okay. I hugged my partner in crime and we cried. I wish I could tell you we cleaned up our lives after that. My room mate with the bitcoins developed a really dangerous substance abuse habits after that. He spent most of his money over the next few years. I went back to class after that summer, but stopped going again because I wanted to party instead and start a career as a writer. I failed out of college. Throughout the years I went on numerous adventures all around the world. I have hundreds of stories, I just have to write them. Oh and I have to learn how to write properly. I don't use a lot of substances today, and I don't encourage people to use dr\*gs of any kind. I have unfortunately lost many friends during the opiate epidemic. Weed is cool though, I like weed. I wouldn't tell people to smoke it, but I'll never shame someone for enjoying some cannabis. Actually, I don't really shame people for anything, it's just not my place to judge anyone. Feel free to judge me though, about how my dorm room became a dr\*g superhighway.

MemeQueen1414,1625179063,/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,"Hi there, this is going to be a big huge post, so prepare yourself now for a dumpster filled with information. I am 19 almost 20 and I am a Sophomore in College (Go Owls: FAU) I been at home since the pandemic (graduated HS in 2020 and then started college soon after virtual) and home life has been worsening significantly and I don't know what to do at all and I been at my wits both emotionally and mentally since I feel trapped, I feel useless, I feel sad bc I'm always being compared to by other ppl or my older sibling, I feel un heard and not being respected or listen to at all, and expectations set for me is unreasonable or if I somehow achieve it then parents back track/change their minds or make me feel like shit or vice versa.

I suspected I have a learning disability (ADHD &amp; Potentially Autism Scale) more than what limited information I know about my Speech and Language Disorder (which family never give a fuck about and usually be by myself in my IEP Meetings in HS) and my accommodations from HS bc of S&amp;L Disorder didn't transfer since my college requires a documentation from a Therapist &amp; Psychologist to which idk where to even begin since I'm all on my own and barley have any money. My close friends that I talk to about this also suspected that I have Depression, Anxiety and maybe even Bipolar (Ma is suspected to have it since she is crazy as hell and they want me to be tested bc genetics is a lovely thing, and don't want me to be off guard even tho haven't shown signs of it) but like what I need for accommodations for college I don't know where to even begin since this is overwhelming and I am afraid of not being able to tackle those issues or just continuing to deal with it ""on my own"" or be silent as usual 

I already applied and got accepted for single dorm housing on campus (have 2 or 3 roommates, originally 3 but one drop and is vacant but its a 4 bedroom housing where we share 2 bathrooms and have a private bedroom) with a 12 meal a week food plan for the upcoming Fall semester but I'm afraid, one because haven't told parents and don't drive (have permit since end of sophomore year in HS via driver's ed class after much hell in doing so, but need practice and anxious of driving both from parents yelling first then teach, Ma telling me I stole or mess up something in her car [isn't true bc I don't take from my own parents in terms of valuable stuff, things like gum or food yea but never money or what Ma accused me of taking or screwing up when I drive in her car] or me being Black and Femme lending NB) nor own a car and two, I'm anxious they just guilt me in staying and I be more stuck then ever. I'm tired of being so useless, I'm trying to stay steady for my friends and even tho my parents (more so my Ma since she calls me worthless and hopes stuff happen to me while Dad is passive and always working 2 jobs, he's a hard worker but hes strict and traditional, always goes with what Ma says even when she's wrong and then always making me have to apologize even when Ma as usual go past my boundaries or make me feel like I would be better off dead instead of adding onto the bill by living here) besides Dad I guess and maybe my older brother (don't have a good relationship but not as bad as Ma just neutral) prob would be happy if anything happens to me

I'm all on my own and idk how to do much in terms of being an adult. I know how to separate clothes and put them in the dryer then fold them as well as ironing but I never start a washer machine (at best Ik the soap and detergent stuff goes but dk like water temperature and which is the best setting for the type of clothes) my cooking skills is microwave or things that are simple since all my life my family made cleaning and cooking a ""female"" job and I reject that bc it was so stupid growing up seeing my Ma cook and what not then be pissed when I don't do so but when my brother does she says that he can stop and she wants me. Yea ik it bite me in the ass but I don't like being told I have to do something just bc I have a uterus, not to mention at least for this semester, we don't have a stove in the housing dorm and only a community housing kitchen in one of the floors. I know how to wash, put away and start a dish washer, swept the house and clean the bathroom but not sure if I need to learn more skills that I'm just either blankin out, never taught/get frighten by being told to go away and don't learn or vice versa

Idk what to do in terms of clothing or hair since one, a lot of clothes in my closet needs major updating since I detested the clothes I wear (a good 85% don't match what I want nor gender identity) and also shopping bc Ma always had to start something or when I get something she later takes it either bc she is upset or when I used to have report cards in K-12 whenever it didn't met her expectations it would get taken away same with birthday or Christmas gifts then takes it long enough she regifts it and me being a dummy I lowkey forgot about it so I get excited for the same stuff twice. Then bonus pts for Ma in comparing me with my older brother or other ppl who did better than me. I want to cut my hair bc I heard the symbolism that cutting your hair means change but I want something low maintenance that I be able to embrace my Haitian &amp; Black Ethnicity as well as learning how to manage my 4c Texture Hair since I am a newbie and dk the products nor braiding to do on myself (I tried on my childhood doll but I just keep on messing up and got sad so I just figured I'ma always have to pay or deal with my hair on my own). Once again I do not know how to go about this so I feel trapped and discouraged already

I don't know how to pack for dorms and not even sure if family would help me without it being a battle or worse make me cancel my housing and then depend on Ma to drive 45 min to and from college. I tried to compromise and said Tri Rail, Ride Sharing with a Friend or Apps, or Bus, parents said no and said that I have to depend on Ma since Dad always working and I don't want to do that both bc even tho I'm so behind in being an adult (*Sniffles*) 

I'm trying even tho I need guidance without being yelled at or hurt or overstimulated (being yelled at by different ppl is a good way or that party noise thingy you blow is also another way to cause me to react) and that I want space, I need air and I need help both for myself to be in a better place so I can live life beyond always being at home and always doing school (which is harder with no accommodations, being in a unsupportive household, indirectly being attacked on my gender and sexuality even tho haven't been out [Religious parents but usually Ma for this], classes isn't interesting and want to take classes that means something like major classes or classes that is more helpful than a General Ed Class can give hence the distractions but just have to force myself to work through it but its becoming harder to do so than b4) never hanging with friends or talkin on the phone (I was on a phone with a friend I haven't spoken to well besides text that is since the pandemic started then my Dad yell at me for being on the phone and then told me to do something Ma wanted me to do, it was to close the TV [Bruh] and then after that Ma told me all I do is eat, shit, be on my laptop/phone and sleep, then proceeds to attack and belittle me) or just have the freedom, the confidence and at ease to be a almost 20 year old in college.

I need help and in Mid August thats when move in day for my college begins (don't have an exact date yet) and I really dk where to begin so I can have a better year in college (I started off ok in Fall and Spring with a 3.52 GPA but then my summer classes kick my ass badly and I ended up withdrawing from a class [during add and drop week for 2nd half of summer thankfully] failing 3 classes (1 class but Canvas divides the 3 credit class into lecture and lab so that's technically 2) then Accounting 1 kick my ass (have to retake it in the Fall bc its required for a business major) bc of our Douchebag prof. The only class I manage to pass was Micro with a C which I'm upset on bc Ik I could have gotten an A but bc of me feeling more discouraged, feeling depressed, I just barley pull through and I feel so freaking guilty about it enough that I'm like bawling in my room for a week and a half privately as I hear in the background how worthless I am and a waste of space by Ma. 

Dad is always working and then whenever he does see me he just be upset at me and always makes me be around Ma 24/7 or told me that have some knowledge do something with my life or act like I have sense or be smart and whenever I do try like telling my parents about this Part Time Job in Mid April, about 10 min away from my house, my folks laugh in my face and then when I get to tell them the bonus of having 1,500 in money after a certain amount of time on the job, they told me to take my ass to CVS/Walgreens (Dad wants me to work in Medical as a first job and in a clean environment even tho I did and got rejected or never call back to which Dad pointed out the other ppl younger than me and made me feel like shit when he told me ""How come I can't be like them"" then told me to try again even tho we in like the worst job unemployment of our time like its so simple, I had so much tears whenever I eagerly open up a email from a job then get crushed when as usual don't get picked or saying their hold my file, told Dad and he says to try harder and stop making excuses and that I'ma feel it when I'm older don't want to do anything with my life) then being told I'm lucky I don't be hired and then fired in the same day.

Ma told me if I was a cart pusher like in the groccery store she would not even bat an eye to me and Dad has this expectations of me working in medical and clean which funny enough the job, Uniform Advantage fit everything that Dad wanted and a bonus it was in business something that I'm actually majoring in but parents never remember and still salty I'm not in Nursing in terms of a major. Hell, my Ma until recently used to lie to my other family members on how I went to other college and taking another major and don't even freakin acknowledge what I'm in and always as usual boast about how great and awesome my older brother is. I hate being told I'm not good enough, yes I freakin know it for years now, u don't have to repeat something I already know. And Dad for the longest time was pissed that I stand up to him and told him I don't want to be in nursing (For Haitian Kids we only got 6 career paths, Basketball or Football, Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer &amp; Engineer when a kid go against that parents flips their shit bc they want a kid to have a stable and known career with bonus pts of bragging rights ofc) and wanted to be in Health Administration/Human Resources and overall Business Aspect, he told me I'ma regret it and even now still feel like shit for standing up and making him upset but I guess its one of the many things I can't just help in making my parents upset about.

Anyways continuing on, when I told my Dad when we went out to shop for food a few weeks back the store and where its at, Dad told me no then when I ask him why he told me its not medical, I reply back its a medical business that sells Scrubs for medical professionals like nurses and assistants, then he told me to apply to CVS and Walgreens which I told him why I can't as explain earlier, then he told me to apply to T-Mobile, I asked Dad in confusion how the heck T-Mobile is medical unless I missed a huge memo that T-Mobile sells Medical Devices instead of phones idk how its medical. I love my Dad but damn it he be contradicting himself and then he tells me I'm being disrespectful whenever I talk back or ask for clarification (hence I be silent and stay confused a lot leading me to get yelled at a lot since idk what I was being asked and when I ask for clarification I get told to have some sense and to figure it out) but anyways he told me that T-Mobile was clean and I legit had to fight off the urge to freakin face palm at this tho like omg Jesus Christ take the wheel.

I just need help, in terms of getting my life together and myself once I'm on campus if by some freakin miracle Parents don't start shit or make me feel like shit and guilt me into canceling the housing contract. I need a part time job to start saving for Study Abroad which I want to do in Spring 2023 and Fall of 2023 of Junior year to Australia, I need money and I don't want to depend on family more than I already have to (ex: that stupid FAFSA) and not to mention it already hurts like mf hell to take out loans for Housing which I still owe even with with loans (sub and unsubsidized loans from FAFSA) and maximum Pell Grant, I need to pay a lil over 750 out of pocket to pay clear off my balance for the fall term and its going to be the same for Spring housing as well. 

The area near my college is expensive as hell and I doubt my folks will cosign me an apartment and even if they did where the hell is a college student going to come up with 1700 per month without sacrificing full time college or being in a bad position to pay it off even with roommates its still expensive not to mention I'm not trying to scare off ppl or be afraid or deal with much ppl since I already come from a rough background I do not want to take out loans and want not just to be in the same environment again. I just feel like I'm trapped since I legit choose being in debt which I avoided for the longest then staying at home and being debt free but feel like shit.

I'm scared that my folks is going to be right and I continue to be useless, I'm trying and I feel like I'm drowning in not being able to function correctly for not being like other ppl my age is doing, I'm just tired of being this way, I didn't ask for this, to be this complicated, to be always being in pain, too hopeful, too optimistic even when hurt, too always being slow and useless, I just don't know how to feel at all anymore

I think this is a good stopping point, there is plenty I could say about my family, but I think y'all can have an idea, I just need some help with dealing with Extreme Helicopter and Toxic (more so Ma but Dad has his moments) parents with impossible expectations and making me feel like no matter how much I try I can never do it, I just end up wasting everyone's time just like what Ma always tells me. I need help with this college stuff as well, I just need help with a lot and stop feeling like I'm drowning.

Even with Ma harsh words and Dad's critical and passive, I don't hate them, I should when it comes to my Mother at least, I still have a few decent memories on whenever Ma is not being a bitch or breakin me further on how she used to be proud on when I do something like she still keep that hand print I did in 1st grade as a Mother's day gift its on the counter of her bathroom, but even with the good memories I still have on her, it doesn't replace her words or actions in the present or rather previous actions and it hurts like hell so much. I be lying if I say I'm not effected by Mother anymore, that I don't constantly wish for her to change or it be back to where it used to, that I secretly envy the ppl that had understanding and great parents. 

Yea I have a roof over my head, food on the table, a bed and then clothes but that's not enough. I don't feel supported, I feel like I'm an inconvenience, I feel like I'm here bc I have to be, I feel like I'm not living a life and its just a endless cycle that I can't escape from, I feel guilty for feeling like this since ppl have it way worse than I do, I feel like my feelings don't matter and that it's ok I'm being treated like this since for the longest time I thought (and still is even when friends told me it isn't) was normal, I been told my feelings don't matter (Mother) or idk what stress is since idk how to work and I'm a piece of shit (Mother again) so idk where to even go about for this at all, need advice please and thank you",college,How Does One Improve Their Life After Leaving Toxic Helicopter Parents Household (Well Trying Too) For College (Sophomore),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,1625200663.0,school is too expensive,21.433333333333334

I already applied and got accepted for single dorm housing on campus (have 2 or 3 roommates, originally 3 but one drop and is vacant but its a 4 bedroom housing where we share 2 bathrooms and have a private bedroom) with a 12 meal a week food plan for the upcoming Fall semester but I'm afraid, one because haven't told parents and don't drive (have permit since end of sophomore year in HS via driver's ed class after much hell in doing so, but need practice and anxious of driving both from parents yelling first then teach, Ma telling me I stole or mess up something in her car [isn't true bc I don't take from my own parents in terms of valuable stuff, things like gum or food yea but never money or what Ma accused me of taking or screwing up when I drive in her car] or me being Black and Femme lending NB) nor own a car and two, I'm anxious they just guilt me in staying and I be more stuck then ever. I'm tired of being so useless, I'm trying to stay steady for my friends and even tho my parents (more so my Ma since she calls me worthless and hopes stuff happen to me while Dad is passive and always working 2 jobs, he's a hard worker but hes strict and traditional, always goes with what Ma says even when she's wrong and then always making me have to apologize even when Ma as usual go past my boundaries or make me feel like I would be better off dead instead of adding onto the bill by living here) besides Dad I guess and maybe my older brother (don't have a good relationship but not as bad as Ma just neutral) prob would be happy if anything happens to me

I'm all on my own and idk how to do much in terms of being an adult. I know how to separate clothes and put them in the dryer then fold them as well as ironing but I never start a washer machine (at best Ik the soap and detergent stuff goes but dk like water temperature and which is the best setting for the type of clothes) my cooking skills is microwave or things that are simple since all my life my family made cleaning and cooking a ""female"" job and I reject that bc it was so stupid growing up seeing my Ma cook and what not then be pissed when I don't do so but when my brother does she says that he can stop and she wants me. Yea ik it bite me in the ass but I don't like being told I have to do something just bc I have a uterus, not to mention at least for this semester, we don't have a stove in the housing dorm and only a community housing kitchen in one of the floors. I know how to wash, put away and start a dish washer, swept the house and clean the bathroom but not sure if I need to learn more skills that I'm just either blankin out, never taught/get frighten by being told to go away and don't learn or vice versa

Idk what to do in terms of clothing or hair since one, a lot of clothes in my closet needs major updating since I detested the clothes I wear (a good 85% don't match what I want nor gender identity) and also shopping bc Ma always had to start something or when I get something she later takes it either bc she is upset or when I used to have report cards in K-12 whenever it didn't met her expectations it would get taken away same with birthday or Christmas gifts then takes it long enough she regifts it and me being a dummy I lowkey forgot about it so I get excited for the same stuff twice. Then bonus pts for Ma in comparing me with my older brother or other ppl who did better than me. I want to cut my hair bc I heard the symbolism that cutting your hair means change but I want something low maintenance that I be able to embrace my Haitian &amp; Black Ethnicity as well as learning how to manage my 4c Texture Hair since I am a newbie and dk the products nor braiding to do on myself (I tried on my childhood doll but I just keep on messing up and got sad so I just figured I'ma always have to pay or deal with my hair on my own). Once again I do not know how to go about this so I feel trapped and discouraged already

I don't know how to pack for dorms and not even sure if family would help me without it being a battle or worse make me cancel my housing and then depend on Ma to drive 45 min to and from college. I tried to compromise and said Tri Rail, Ride Sharing with a Friend or Apps, or Bus, parents said no and said that I have to depend on Ma since Dad always working and I don't want to do that both bc even tho I'm so behind in being an adult (*Sniffles*) 

I'm trying even tho I need guidance without being yelled at or hurt or overstimulated (being yelled at by different ppl is a good way or that party noise thingy you blow is also another way to cause me to react) and that I want space, I need air and I need help both for myself to be in a better place so I can live life beyond always being at home and always doing school (which is harder with no accommodations, being in a unsupportive household, indirectly being attacked on my gender and sexuality even tho haven't been out [Religious parents but usually Ma for this], classes isn't interesting and want to take classes that means something like major classes or classes that is more helpful than a General Ed Class can give hence the distractions but just have to force myself to work through it but its becoming harder to do so than b4) never hanging with friends or talkin on the phone (I was on a phone with a friend I haven't spoken to well besides text that is since the pandemic started then my Dad yell at me for being on the phone and then told me to do something Ma wanted me to do, it was to close the TV [Bruh] and then after that Ma told me all I do is eat, shit, be on my laptop/phone and sleep, then proceeds to attack and belittle me) or just have the freedom, the confidence and at ease to be a almost 20 year old in college.

I need help and in Mid August thats when move in day for my college begins (don't have an exact date yet) and I really dk where to begin so I can have a better year in college (I started off ok in Fall and Spring with a 3.52 GPA but then my summer classes kick my ass badly and I ended up withdrawing from a class [during add and drop week for 2nd half of summer thankfully] failing 3 classes (1 class but Canvas divides the 3 credit class into lecture and lab so that's technically 2) then Accounting 1 kick my ass (have to retake it in the Fall bc its required for a business major) bc of our Douchebag prof. The only class I manage to pass was Micro with a C which I'm upset on bc Ik I could have gotten an A but bc of me feeling more discouraged, feeling depressed, I just barley pull through and I feel so freaking guilty about it enough that I'm like bawling in my room for a week and a half privately as I hear in the background how worthless I am and a waste of space by Ma. 

Dad is always working and then whenever he does see me he just be upset at me and always makes me be around Ma 24/7 or told me that have some knowledge do something with my life or act like I have sense or be smart and whenever I do try like telling my parents about this Part Time Job in Mid April, about 10 min away from my house, my folks laugh in my face and then when I get to tell them the bonus of having 1,500 in money after a certain amount of time on the job, they told me to take my ass to CVS/Walgreens (Dad wants me to work in Medical as a first job and in a clean environment even tho I did and got rejected or never call back to which Dad pointed out the other ppl younger than me and made me feel like shit when he told me ""How come I can't be like them"" then told me to try again even tho we in like the worst job unemployment of our time like its so simple, I had so much tears whenever I eagerly open up a email from a job then get crushed when as usual don't get picked or saying their hold my file, told Dad and he says to try harder and stop making excuses and that I'ma feel it when I'm older don't want to do anything with my life) then being told I'm lucky I don't be hired and then fired in the same day.

Ma told me if I was a cart pusher like in the groccery store she would not even bat an eye to me and Dad has this expectations of me working in medical and clean which funny enough the job, Uniform Advantage fit everything that Dad wanted and a bonus it was in business something that I'm actually majoring in but parents never remember and still salty I'm not in Nursing in terms of a major. Hell, my Ma until recently used to lie to my other family members on how I went to other college and taking another major and don't even freakin acknowledge what I'm in and always as usual boast about how great and awesome my older brother is. I hate being told I'm not good enough, yes I freakin know it for years now, u don't have to repeat something I already know. And Dad for the longest time was pissed that I stand up to him and told him I don't want to be in nursing (For Haitian Kids we only got 6 career paths, Basketball or Football, Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer &amp; Engineer when a kid go against that parents flips their shit bc they want a kid to have a stable and known career with bonus pts of bragging rights ofc) and wanted to be in Health Administration/Human Resources and overall Business Aspect, he told me I'ma regret it and even now still feel like shit for standing up and making him upset but I guess its one of the many things I can't just help in making my parents upset about.

Anyways continuing on, when I told my Dad when we went out to shop for food a few weeks back the store and where its at, Dad told me no then when I ask him why he told me its not medical, I reply back its a medical business that sells Scrubs for medical professionals like nurses and assistants, then he told me to apply to CVS and Walgreens which I told him why I can't as explain earlier, then he told me to apply to T-Mobile, I asked Dad in confusion how the heck T-Mobile is medical unless I missed a huge memo that T-Mobile sells Medical Devices instead of phones idk how its medical. I love my Dad but damn it he be contradicting himself and then he tells me I'm being disrespectful whenever I talk back or ask for clarification (hence I be silent and stay confused a lot leading me to get yelled at a lot since idk what I was being asked and when I ask for clarification I get told to have some sense and to figure it out) but anyways he told me that T-Mobile was clean and I legit had to fight off the urge to freakin face palm at this tho like omg Jesus Christ take the wheel.

I just need help, in terms of getting my life together and myself once I'm on campus if by some freakin miracle Parents don't start shit or make me feel like shit and guilt me into canceling the housing contract. I need a part time job to start saving for Study Abroad which I want to do in Spring 2023 and Fall of 2023 of Junior year to Australia, I need money and I don't want to depend on family more than I already have to (ex: that stupid FAFSA) and not to mention it already hurts like mf hell to take out loans for Housing which I still owe even with with loans (sub and unsubsidized loans from FAFSA) and maximum Pell Grant, I need to pay a lil over 750 out of pocket to pay clear off my balance for the fall term and its going to be the same for Spring housing as well. 

The area near my college is expensive as hell and I doubt my folks will cosign me an apartment and even if they did where the hell is a college student going to come up with 1700 per month without sacrificing full time college or being in a bad position to pay it off even with roommates its still expensive not to mention I'm not trying to scare off ppl or be afraid or deal with much ppl since I already come from a rough background I do not want to take out loans and want not just to be in the same environment again. I just feel like I'm trapped since I legit choose being in debt which I avoided for the longest then staying at home and being debt free but feel like shit.

I'm scared that my folks is going to be right and I continue to be useless, I'm trying and I feel like I'm drowning in not being able to function correctly for not being like other ppl my age is doing, I'm just tired of being this way, I didn't ask for this, to be this complicated, to be always being in pain, too hopeful, too optimistic even when hurt, too always being slow and useless, I just don't know how to feel at all anymore

I think this is a good stopping point, there is plenty I could say about my family, but I think y'all can have an idea, I just need some help with dealing with Extreme Helicopter and Toxic (more so Ma but Dad has his moments) parents with impossible expectations and making me feel like no matter how much I try I can never do it, I just end up wasting everyone's time just like what Ma always tells me. I need help with this college stuff as well, I just need help with a lot and stop feeling like I'm drowning.

Even with Ma harsh words and Dad's critical and passive, I don't hate them, I should when it comes to my Mother at least, I still have a few decent memories on whenever Ma is not being a bitch or breakin me further on how she used to be proud on when I do something like she still keep that hand print I did in 1st grade as a Mother's day gift its on the counter of her bathroom, but even with the good memories I still have on her, it doesn't replace her words or actions in the present or rather previous actions and it hurts like hell so much. I be lying if I say I'm not effected by Mother anymore, that I don't constantly wish for her to change or it be back to where it used to, that I secretly envy the ppl that had understanding and great parents. 

Yea I have a roof over my head, food on the table, a bed and then clothes but that's not enough. I don't feel supported, I feel like I'm an inconvenience, I feel like I'm here bc I have to be, I feel like I'm not living a life and its just a endless cycle that I can't escape from, I feel guilty for feeling like this since ppl have it way worse than I do, I feel like my feelings don't matter and that it's ok I'm being treated like this since for the longest time I thought (and still is even when friends told me it isn't) was normal, I been told my feelings don't matter (Mother) or idk what stress is since idk how to work and I'm a piece of shit (Mother again) so idk where to even go about for this at all, need advice please and thank you",college,How Does One Improve Their Life After Leaving Toxic Helicopter Parents Household (Well Trying Too) For College (Sophomore),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,1625200663.0,can't pay for school,21.433333333333334
[deleted],1331318181,/r/AskReddit/comments/qp6xp/how_far_would_you_go_to_defend_your_viewsbeliefs/,"Two days ago I got into a huge argument with this girl at school about KONY 2012. I'm shooting rebuttals left and right at her, she won't have any of it. Eventually I shut up, as everyone else started yelling at me for being a heartless piece of shit. 

I go back that evening and post a long post to her Facebook wall, with all the information I talked about and more, with the proof. I made it very non aggressive, and made sure that I agreed with the cause, but not the means. I few minuted later someone tells me to stfu, and then she says ""shut up you knob"" and deletes the post.

Unfazed, and by this point kissing my social standing goodbye for a few weeks, I post a copy of my wall post as a status. I get into a very long argument with someone about the legitimacy of Invisible Children, rebutting every single argument he throws at me.

Today, I got called heartless, a cunt, a piece of shit etc by almost every single person who has seen my status/ heard me talk about my views toward this campaign. Some racism got thrown in there too (I'm Jewish, and am saying not to donate to them. You can guess what they say), and I'm still saying ""No! These people are lying to you, using your money for their fancy offices and fat salaries!""

So, Reddit. Is it better to stand up for your views and take a risk, or just go with the sheep? Share your stories below.

**Transcript of status/argument**

Even if you do read this, you probably won't change your mind. But I would feel wrong if I didn't write this.Firstly, I don't feel that it's a bad cause. On the contrary, Kony is a bad man, what he does is bad and he should be stopped. However you should not be donating to Invisible Children to try and stop him, for a number of reasons. 

1. The finances of Invisible Children are public (http://c2052482.r82.cf0.rackcdn.com/images/737/original/FY11-Audited%20Financial%20Statements.pdf?1320205055). That means that we can see what is bring done with the donations that they receive. If you look at them, you can see that they use around 2/3 of the money for the travel, films, and salaries of the staff. Hardly ideal for an issue that needs action, not awareness. Of the $8.9 million in donations they spent in 2011, this is the breakdown: $1.7 million in US employee salaries $357,000 in Film costs $850,000 in Production costs $751,000 in Computer equipment $244,000 in ""professional services"" (DC lobbyists) $1.07 million in travel expenses $400,000 in yearly office rent in downtown San Diego $16,000 in Entertainment etc... Only 2.8 million (31%) made it to their charity program (which is further whittled down by local Ugandan government officials) - what do the children actually get?

2. Invisible Children support the Ugandan government. It is a dictatorship, and among many of its human rights violations the regime tortures prisons, oppresses other political parties and the press and also wishes to introduce a bill that would have 'convicted homosexuals' put to death.

3. In the civil war in which Yoweri Museveni gained power child soldiers were used by his army (National Resistance Army) which is now the army of Uganda but under a different name. (http://www.teachkidspeace.org/doc315.php)

4. The bulk of Invisible Children’s spending isn’t on supporting African militias, but on awareness and filmmaking. Which can be great, except that Foreign Affairs has claimed that Invisible Children (among others) “manipulates facts for strategic purposes, exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders and emphasizing the LRA’s use of innocent children as soldiers, and portraying Kony — a brutal man, to be sure — as uniquely awful, a Kurtz-like embodiment of evil.” (http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136673/mareike-schomerus-tim-allen-and-koen-vlassenroot/obama-takes-on-the-lra?page=show)

5. Still, Kony’s a bad guy, and he’s been around a while. Which is why the US has been involved in stopping him for years. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) has sent multiple missions to capture or kill Kony over the years (http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136673/mareike-schomerus-tim-allen-and-koen-vlassenroot/obama-takes-on-the-lra?page=show). And they’ve failed time and time again, each provoking a ferocious response and increased retaliative slaughter. The issue with taking out a man who uses a child army is that his bodyguards are children. Any effort to capture or kill him will almost certainly result in many children’s deaths (http://chrisblattman.com/2011/11/21/what-you-should-be-reading-if-you-want-to-understand-the-us-and-the-lords-resistance-army/).

**Argument in comments on said status**

**TL;DR** Kony is a scam. NO IT'S NOT. Yes it is. NO IT'S NOT. x1000

**HIM**‎ 

1. Yeah idvck those people have to live? and of course they need money for the travel to Africa, the equipment, etc... They're putting time and effort into this, it's called a profitable charity. What you want them to spend all their time supporting a cause flying to Africa, without getting paid? The 2 thirds that they keep is necessary for them to keep going. And the third that they used for the kids is what this company is all about. Payment for the film was necessary idvck because they raised awareness, and now many people will donate and the charity will raise more money. 

2. They work with the Ugandan government because they have to as their government are trying to take down Kony. So yeah the ugandan government is a dictatorship, But they can't do anything about that can they? So instead of saying ""oh not gonna work with and just let the cause down"" they actually do their best to help the ugandan people to fight against Kony. 

3. Fighting against a government is much harder than just fighting against a crazy guy. There's dictatorships in many countries, but it's not our country, we can't do anything about it, except go to war, and end up killing more people. But that cause can treated, without going to war with the government, by working with them.

4. Do you think that if you don't exaggerate and the cause doesn't look ""that bad"" people will donate? No don't think so. They did raise awareness, for a reason, not for fame; to fight against Kony. 

5. Did anyone know about this cause before? Did they donate money? No. Now they will, and it'll help the government fight for the cause.

6. Why can't you just accept that what they did was great, and it's gonna help many people who are right now fighting against their will?

**ME** 

1. they have offices in downtown san diego with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of furniture. that's not what I think of when I think charity. (http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/qk0pd/kony_2012_help_raise_awareness_and_stop_joseph/c3yjbbn)

2. you could work against a government that does worse things, considering Kony's army is 250 strong. (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1763486362045&amp;set=p.1763486362045&amp;type=1&amp;theater)

3. tell that to the people of egypt, libya and syria.

4. and for profit, as previously stated 20% of donations go towards salaries.

5. yup, they will, and that money will go towards their nice offices and furniture, maybe finance another film, or buy some new cameras.

6. so great. too bad the cause is non existent anymore, as Kony's army is now only 250 and withdrew from Uganda 6 years ago.

**HIM** 

1. Do you just believe anything you see on fucking reddit? 

2. If you were the mom of one of those 250 kids how would you feel huh? Any cause deserves awareness. 

3. Yeah but that's different idvck cause it's people from the actual country who didn't ask anything to anyone, just decided to rebel. 

4. As i told you already, they need salaries. They can't just keep fighting for a cause without getting a salary... 

5. Bullshit. Why would they make a new movie? And a third of the money still goes towards uganda... Jesus idvck you have to make a profit, you can't just live of 
nothing -.-

6. It still is existant, maybe not in Uganda, but it still is. There's people fighting for a cause, give them credit for trying.

**ME** 

1. yes. in case you don't, here is a link. http://g.co/maps/2z8he looks pretty fancy to me, certainly for a charity.

2. the fact that I'm the grandchild of a holocaust survivor doesn't stop you making jokes about it. 

3. well okay then let's fight against these 250 kids who aren't even in our country anymore.

4. that equates to about 45k per employee. pretty high for a charity.

5. well they have 200+ videos on youtube, so obviously that $1.7 million of computer equipment is being put to good use…

6. if you're gonna put that much effort into a cause make it for one that's going have a relatively large impact.

**HIM** 

1. Oh so a charity shoulds work in the streets? 

2. Um ok now can i go back in time and stop holocaust? No. And i'll still make jokes about Jacob and his african accent..

3. What d'you wanna do? Just abandon them? 

4. 45K a year idvck. That's under the average american revenue... 

5. Umm that's good dumbass. And that's not the 1.7 million, it's the other 2 thirds.. 

6. What's a large inpact huh? Is 250 kids not a large enough impact for you? heartless bitch

**ME** 

1. it's a non profit, they should not be working in a fancy skyscraper. 

2. well you can't go back in time and stop the abductions either. but you can respect the dead, especially in front of someone who's related to someone who witnessed it. and I haven't heard you make a joseph kony joke once yet (and yeah, it's joseph, not jabcob), but even if you did that would not be right.

3. sometimes you just don't have the choice. it's all they've known for their whole lives.

4. $18 under the average salary. I bet you it's a lot higher for the founders too. 

5. you're right, it's more than $1.7 million. silly me. ($357,000 in Film costs, $850,000 in Production costs, $751,000 in Computer equipment)

6. remember in that psychology lesson? when you said it's better to save six people than one? well the same thing applies here, you could intervene here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011–2012_Syrian_uprising or here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War and save a lot more people.

**HIM**

1. no, they should work in good offices like everyone else. They need to be taken seriously. 

2. No, but those kids are still alive. And you don't see kony in the movie dumbass, but you do see JACOB the black kid with his african accent. And it's racist jokes, get over it. 

3. idvck you're being so heartless, 250 lives is alot! a lot of kids are out there, used as infantry for no reason... 

4. Exactly they deserve an average salary. 

5. As i've said already it was to raise awareness. Now that they have, they're not gonna buy more computers, or make another movie... 

6. Many people are already on that. The movie was made so that an unknown cause could be taken into account by the population. They've managed to get more soldiers looking for them... So maybe they're taking a bit too much profit, but they're doing it for a good reason.

**ME**

1. NO THEY SHOULD NOT. If I give money to a cause I expect it to go to the cause, NOT to some fancy offices and furniture or to computers or to making films. I expect it to go to the cause, to help change something.

2. I didn't watch the whole thing because I got sick of the manipulative style and lies.

3. how many people do you see posting about ""Save Homs"" or ""Save the Syrians""? none. however, if you look, 1770 people have been killed there in the last year. that's a better cause to get worked up about. but you know why no teenagers care? because some fucking director didn't make a manipulative video about it.

4. no they don't. if I work at a not for profit I do it out of the goodness of my heart, not because I want a good salary. 

5. oh really. wanna bet on that? and even if they didn't it would still be a lot of money wasted. 

6. it's unknown for a reason. 250 people are not a lot. it's bad, sure, but there are worse things that are happening out there. 

7. can you show me that you donated like you said you would?

**HIM**

1. So they should have no offices, no computers? 

2. Because you don't care about a serious cause that doesn't involve jews. 

3. Okay, well that's a good thing to know for the future, that by raising awareness through social networks, we can make things change. 

4. So they're suppose to get no money and live on the streets? 

5. They actually care about the cause idvck, not just a fucking movie.. 

6. Oh 250 people is not that now is it? Dick.
 
7. I said i'd ask my mom. I don't have enough money. And many people will donate you'll see on their site, their ""public shit"". **[He gets a hundred euros a week doing a rich kid's homework]**

**ME** 

1. they should have computers, they should have offices, but not expensive offices and expensive furniture. that money would have done much more in uganda. last thing I heard ugandan child soldiers don't benefit from high rise offices and expensive furniture thousands of kilometers away.

2. how many jews are there in syria? or mexico?

3. no, you can't.

4. no. you're supposed to get minimum wage and work there because you want to and believe in the cause. if you really want to support the cause you work a proper job and give some of your salary to the charity.

5. which is why only a third of their income goes to Uganda?

6. it's not a lot compared to the amount of people dying in syria or mexico, right now. (8500+ and 35000+, respectively)

7. you got 50 euros this morning. if you weren't selfish you would donate to the cause you are so generously spreading.

**HIM**

1. Also guys we need proper furniture for a charity to work. Do you really think they can just go around and sit down in huts on little plastic chairs and drink out of plastic teacups? NO we must donate money to keep them and their furniture.

2. Oh so you've donated to mexicans now have you? 

3. Yes you can, prove is everyone know about this and i guarantee donations will be made. 

4. Idvck this takes all their time, they are fighting for something, and deserve money... 

5. Idvck i've already told you, the 2 thirds are needed for them to make a minimum living, and get the equipment needed, raise awareness.. etc.

6. Just because it's a small cause doesn't mean you can't stand for it. They shouldn's just be abandoned cause there's ""only"" 250 of them... 

7. I'm not in the position to donate, my parents don't even know i have this money. And i never said i'd actually donate? I just said the cause was touching, and they did a good job and i'm glad they'll get help for those kids.

**ME**

1. you don't need to live in a skyscraper and have fancy furniture to work well.

2. no, but I'm raising awareness. like you, spreading this stupid campaign.

3. It's always someone else. never you.

4. you don't work at a non profit for money.

5. how come the red cross can use 92% of their donations on their causes?

6. they're not being abandoned. the US has made many attempts to kill/capture him.

7. so go to the nearest charity and give in 50 euros in cash then.

**HIM**
‎

1. ok they went a bit OTT with the furniture and all.

2. If they'd made a movie about mexican traffic and a foundation and everything, they'd probably be further along with dealing with it. 

3. That's what you think. People do donate to charities idvck. Just cause you don't doesn't mean other people don't. 

4. They need to live and do this full time. 

5. Red cross has people who work for free and beg for money. These people are just doing it more smartly. 

6. Now they'll make a biggeer attempt, because of them. 

7. I have a life, I don't want to spend money on that. My mom gives money on a regular basis to charity including amnesty international or medecin sans frontieres.

**ME**

1. One down, 6 to go.

2. you shouldn't need a movie to donate. you should be doing it out of the goodness of your heart and you should believe in the cause.

3. I don't see you donating, even though you have a substantial amount of disposable income.

4. so they should work a proper job and give to the charity, NOT take money away from the cause and keep it for themselves. 

5. it's really fucking smart to lie in a video and ask people to donate.

6. unfortunately, as it is an election year, nothing will happen.

7. what do you have to buy, now that you got caught smoking weed and aren't allowed out? and so does mine fyi, but I don't because I don't have a steady stream of disposable income.

**HIM**

1. I said they went a bit OTT. Didn't agree. Met you halfway. 

2. Well do you see people talking about mexican drig trfics everyday? naha. They're more affected by a movie like this. 

3. As i said my mom already donates to charities and everything. And i never said i'd donate or i'm a good person? I'm saying what they're doing is good. 

4. ummm yes they should, then they have all their time for the charity. 

5. They're not lying in a video. And it seems more effective than going out in the streets with a red uniform...

6. We'll see about that. 

7. So? I want to get a new guitar, and many other shit. I never said i was gonna donate and shit or whatever, i didn't even share the video... But if i was an adult with much more money, i'd donate 100 euros or so yes. and i'd know 33 euros of that would be used for a good cause.

**ME**

1. got you to change your viewpoint. that's good.

2. exactly, but they shouldn't be. 

3. yes you did. We were arguing, I said you should donate and you said okay.

4. 5 to go.

6. they exaggerated about the cause (http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/311353/20120308/kony-2012-video-invisible-children-uganda-lra.htm) and implied the LRA was 
still in uganda, when it hasn't been for over 6 years.

7. you want a new guitar over saving poor child soldiers? you ""heartless bitch""

I recommend that you read this entire post, but you can certainly skip around if you wish. Also, just because this post is geared toward people who haven't been to college before doesn't mean returning college students won't find any good advice here. I encourage all college students to check out this post, and if you've been to college before feel free to share some of your own insight too!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[1\] Academics- Building A Good Schedule***

* **Get familiar with the logistics of course selection**. Many colleges have specific websites or platforms used to pick classes. Each school does it a bit differently, so make sure you know what to expect.
* **Know the exact day and time you can start picking classes**. You want the best chance of getting into your classes, especially if you’re a freshman with little to no credits earned.
* **Have backups for your classes**. Since you probably have few credits earned, you might not get into all the classes you want, but you still need to take at least 12 credits per semester to remain a full-time student.
* **Use RateMyProfessors wisely**. Sometimes you must take a certain class for your major and/or the only person teaching it has bad reviews, but for gen eds and/or classes where there are multiple instructors it’s always better to choose someone with good reviews.
* **Don’t be afraid of early class times**. Dragging yourself to an 8 or 9 am might be miserable in the moment, but you may dread a night class more. If you couldn’t take a class during prime midday hours, would you rather take an early class (one starting at 8-9 am) or a late class (one starting at 5-6 pm)?
* **Map out the classes you plan to take each semester during your freshman year**. To do so, get familiar with general education requirements and the required courses for your major. Many advisors will be happy to help you with this if you ask them. However, it never hurts to double-check with an upperclassman because I’ve heard some advisors give advice that forces people to take summer/winter classes to graduate on time or stay an extra semester.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[2\] Academics- How To Succeed In Your Classes***

* **Read the syllabus**. First, you avoid wasting your professor’s time because you asked a question outlined in the syllabus. Second, you get a sense of course expectations, assignment descriptions, and due dates early on. Sure, you won’t memorize every single detail or due date by reading it once, but you can always refer to the document as needed.
* **Spend money on textbooks wisely**. Unless your class requires the use of a textbook with an access code, try to find a cheaper version of the book. Amazon is a great way to get inexpensive textbooks, especially because they often allow you to rent e-books, which tend to be cheaper than physical ones (bought or rented).
* **Don’t skip class**. Not going to class once is like a gateway drug – after that, it’s easy to justify not going whenever you’re tired or just not feeling it. The only exception is when you’re really sick and can’t focus on the lecture anyway.
* **Sit in the front during class**. This is partially an image thing, as professors think positively of students who sit up front since they tend to be more studious. Also, sitting in a spot where the professor can easily see you will make you more likely to be attentive.
* **Go to office hours whenever you’re struggling**. No matter how small your question is, it’s better to get it answered early instead of letting everything pile up right before an exam.
* **Figure out your note-taking style(s)**. Will you take notes with a pen and paper, a laptop, a tablet, or a combination? There are many factors to consider, including but not limited to:
   * Will the class involve calculations or diagrams that require pen and paper?
   * Can you handwrite quickly and neatly enough?
   * Can you type quickly enough?
   * Can you avoid the distractions of a laptop or tablet?
   * Can you afford a tablet?
* **Study your notes after each class or review the notes from all your classes at the end of each day**. Doing so reduces the stress brought on by cramming the night before, and it helps you retain information better because you’re reviewing it regularly.
* **If you have assigned textbook readings, read them after the lecture**. It’s like a review and the context from the lecture can help you understand the material better.
* **Avoid using your phone or other distractions until your work is done**. The more time you spend on distractions, the less time you have to do work. Also, even if you “only” spend 10 minutes doing something else, you end up losing more time than that because it takes time to refocus on the task at hand.
* **Start projects early**. You don’t need to complete the whole project the day it’s assigned; just work on a bit each day to start, and as the deadline gets closer increase the workload.
* **Always do the extra credit**. Even if you're doing well in the class now, there might be a tough assignment or exam later in the semester that lowers your grade.
* **Make at least one friend in your major**. That way you can study together and support each other academically. Who knows, you might even become best friends!
* **Check out academic support resources offered by the university**. Depending on the university you attend, there may be centers that provide general study tips, math help, writing help, and so on. Ask your advisor what services your college offers. They’re “free” because you pay tuition – use them!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[3\] Organization &amp; Time Management***

* **Use Google Calendar and Google Keep**. Use Google Calendar to mark times you have class, assignment due dates, and exam dates; and non-academic events like work or clubs. Use Google Keep to make a variety of to-do lists, such as daily tasks, weekly tasks, and tasks that break a big project into chunks.
* **Use a reminder app to keep track of small things you want to do**. This is great for smaller tasks that we tend to forget if they aren’t written down, such as making a phone call. I know iPhones have a designated Reminder app, and I’m sure other smartphones do too.
* **Avoid listing too many tasks to complete on a given day**. It’s better to put fewer items on your to-do list and add more, rather than add too much and get upset if you can’t get everything done.
* **Organize your computer.** Make sure you have designated folders for emails instead of letting them pile up in your inbox, make folders for each class you’re taking, and so on. Even though there isn’t physical clutter, having a disorganized computer still makes productivity difficult.
* **Find out where each class is located in advance**. Instead of scrambling to find your class in the morning, try to walk the campus the day before to ensure you know how to get to each building and room. This is especially helpful if your campus is big!
* **Get around campus efficiently**. If your dorm is far from most classes, don’t come back until the end of the day; instead, find spots to study close to your classes. This is particularly useful when the weather is bad and you want to spend as little time outside as possible. Also, even if your campus has buses, actually using one tends to be inefficient because you’ll probably spend more time waiting for it than it takes to get to your destination. Save the bus for bad weather when it’s truly a miserable experience walking to class.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[4\] Dorm Life***

* **Be a respectful roommate**. Even if you don’t do unequivocally bad things like bringing unannounced guests or turning the room into a pigsty, your habits may still annoy someone else. For example, if you like calling friends or family in the room often, some people find it distracting. Ask your roommate what they don’t like and try your best to accommodate their needs within reason.
* **It’s okay not to be best friends with your roommate as long as you get along**. In fact, it’s better not to be BFFs so you have the motivation to branch out and make new friends.
* **Always try to sort out conflicts with your roommate before escalating things to the RA**. Many roommate disagreements are minor enough to be sorted out between the roommates. By doing so, you learn how to deal with interpersonal conflict, which is an important life skill.
* **Don’t be obnoxious to your RA**. Most RAs don’t want to make your life miserable because they’re busy students and don’t have the energy to write people up. As long as you avoid doing something that’s obviously not allowed, such as having visible alcohol, they probably won’t care.
* **Don’t sit in your room all day**. It might be easy to spend time in your room whenever you don’t have class, but it prevents you from exploring all that campus has to offer. Also, your roommate may need personal space sometimes and that isn’t possible if you’re always around.
* **Do laundry when things aren’t too busy.** Laundry rooms tend to be pretty empty when most people are sleeping (early in the morning), afternoons at the start of the week (Mon, Tues), and when people are going out (Friday or Saturday night). On the other hand, afternoons at the end of the week and Sundays are generally busy. It’s also a good idea to scope out your specific laundry room to see when it’s the most or least busy. Another tip: stay in your dorm while you do laundry to catch up on homework or perhaps tidy your room since you’re already in the cleaning mindset!
* **Always take your keys and lock the door**. Do this whether you’re going to the bathroom for a few minutes or will be gone the whole day. The people on your floor may be perfectly trustworthy, but you never know for sure.
* **Decorate your room at least a little bit**. Even putting up a tapestry or some fairy lights will help make your space more cozy and relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[5\] Extracurriculars***

* **Start making connections with professors as soon as you can**. You can do so by participating in class, asking follow-up questions after class, and asking them about their research. Knowing at least 2-3 professors well can provide you with quality job references and strong recommendation letters for grad programs and/or scholarships.
* **Get involved in a professional and just-for-fun experience – at least one of each**. Professional experiences include research or a job/internship related to your major. Having this under your belt allows you to obtain valuable experiences and soft skills you can discuss in an interview. Just-for-fun experiences include clubs or intramural sports. These allow you to take a break from school while doing something enjoyable and making friends.
* **Sign up for a bunch of clubs at the start of the semester**. Join the email list for each club that sounds remotely interesting, and then you can decide whether you truly have an interest in that activity or are free when meetings are held.
* **Get a part-time job on campus**. There are many benefits to working: You have money to spend on “fun” things like going out or ordering things online, can start saving for the future, and improve your time management skills by balancing work with school. I recommend doing no more than 10-15 hours a week, though it’s possible you have such a busy schedule that you can’t work at all. As far as getting a job, most colleges have a portal with on-campus job listings – find out how to access and use it. Many students end up at a dining hall or do some type of office/administrative work. Generally speaking, dining hall jobs are easier to get but require more hard work, while office/administrative jobs are harder to get but give you some time to catch up on homework. A few tips for getting a job: If you don't get an invitation to interview within a few weeks of submitting your application and there was a contact person listed on the job description, follow up with them. Since many people don’t do that, it’ll make you stand out. Also, many colleges offer resume critiques and practice interviews that make you a better applicant, so find out how to access this help.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[6\] Social Life***

* **Don’t let your past social life set you back**. Even if you were socially awkward or disliked in high school, you now have a fresh start! There’s no way everyone can know each other, especially if it’s a big campus, meaning you won’t have the reputation you did back in your hometown. Even if you end up not clicking with someone, there are plenty of other people to meet!
* **Say yes if anyone offers to hang out**. Even if you don’t like them at first, they might end up being really nice! This is particularly important if you don’t know many people yet.
* **Be prepared for unique opportunities to make friends**. Being in the same major, class, or club are excellent ways to meet new people, but they’re not the only ones! To use a personal example, once I got locked out of my room and couldn’t text my roommate since my phone was still in there. I ended up borrowing the phone of a girl in my dorm lounge and we became friends.
* **Quality over quantity**. This saying holds true for many things in life. In this case, a few friends who’ll be there for you in times of need is better than 20 fake friends.
* **Make plans with someone at least once a week**. Whether you grab food, study, or go to an event, it’s important to have some type of regular social support. With that being said…
* **It’s perfectly okay to be alone in college**. No one will judge you for eating alone at the dining hall or walking to class by yourself. In fact, spending time alone helps find yourself and ensures you don’t rely on others for all your happiness.
* **If partying is your thing, no judgment**. Just know your limits and always go with people you trust in case something goes wrong. With that said, you don’t have to drink to have a good time!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[7\] Health &amp; Wellness***

* **Try to eat 3 balanced meals a day**. If you don’t have time for breakfast in the dining hall, at least have snacks you can eat before you head to class. For lunch, eat a meal that includes carbs (ex. rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) and veggies. For dinner, eat some carbs and veggies, plus some protein (ex. chicken, fish, beans). I know it’s tempting to just eat grilled cheese and burgers, but that should be an occasional treat rather than a daily occurrence.
* **Stay hydrated**. Drink something with every meal at the very least, and then anytime you’re thirsty. Water is best but tea, coffee, or juice is okay too. Consume sugary drinks like soda in moderation.
* **Work out when you can**. Even if it’s hard to get to the gym 5 days a week, you can still incorporate physical activity into your life in creative ways. For example, walk as much as you can, do stretches in your room, run up your dorm stairs, go on jogs around campus, take fitness classes at the gym, arrange weekend bike rides with friends, etc.
* **Make your mental health a priority**. Taking a few moments to take a deep breath, meditating, having social support on campus, and reaching out to family back home are a few ways to maintain your mental health. Learn what works for you, don’t be afraid to try new things, and get professional help if you’re seriously struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[8\] Miscellaneous***

* **Be smart with your money**. Going out, ordering delivery, and buying things online is fun, but try to keep it as a reward rather than a weekly (or even more often) occurrence. Also, consider getting a credit card to start building credit, as long as you’re responsible with it and avoid debt!
* **Spend time outside**. Most college campuses are beautiful and have lovely places to study or relax outside. It really depends on the specific college you attend, but simply walking around campus for a few weeks will help you discover some of the best outdoor areas to spend time.
* **Don’t go home every weekend or call your family all the time**. College is meant to be a stepping stone to living completely alone. Make sure you can be without your family while you still have thousands of peers around you for support.
* **Find a good bathroom on campus**. When nature calls, you want the process to be as smooth as possible. Since you can’t always return to your dorm, make sure to find another bathroom that doesn’t get a ton of traffic, isn’t too far, is clean, etc. I generally go to bathrooms on higher floors in buildings toward the center of campus.
* **Tackle your fears**. Everyone is afraid of different things, but no matter what they are it’s important to face them head-on. For example, I used to hate calling on the phone, but then I got a job on campus where I had to call people regularly and my fear of the phone was greatly reduced.",college,Things I wish someone told me before I started college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vw3u15/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_i_started/,1657516488.0,struggling with tuition,20.006666666666668
[deleted],1322733666,/r/AskReddit/comments/mvzpd/how_do_i_get_my_life_back_on_track/,"There is a tl;dr version at the bottom.

Back-story - This is a story of a what has happened because of computers and what my life is currently like. It has happened in 2 separate locations.

State: Texas
School District: Klein ISD, Cleveland ISD
Schools: Klein Oak High School, Cleveland High School

I was a Teenage Boy when all this happened(13-16). My Parents, My Siblings(1 Brother, 2 Sisters), and I moved to a new house in the Klein ISD School District. I was in 8th grade when we moved. The middle school had a unique perk starting just this year. All teachers and students in the school were leased a Laptop(Had to pay $80 insurance) to use during classes and bring home for the entire school year. 
Now this part has nothing to do with the legal problems but I am giving a backstory.

We basically spent the entire year doing classwork, homework, and tests on this computer. The setup was basically, ""Laptop &lt;-&gt; WEP Encrypted Wifi &lt;-&gt; Network Servers(for homework, etc.) / Internet"".
Remember how I said I was shy and had Social Anxiety? Well I didn't really know how to communicate with people. But essentially I heard guys and girls that said they wanted to go to MySpace or some game websites. I knew about proxies before I went to that school so the knowledge helped me help others. 
They had a two tier system of filtering websites. One was a network-wide based filter and the other one was a Native application. 
At anytime only 1 was active. If we were using the school network the local application was inactive and if we were at home the local application would become active.
They had a couple of flaws.
1. The network-wide based filter didn't filter SSL websites(However the Native application did) so we could just use the https version of a site or if that option wasn't available you could just use the https version of a web-based proxy.
2. You could essentially bypass the native application while at home by booting up the laptop with a Live OS(In my case it was Damn Small Linux / Puppy Linux). And while at home surf anything you wanted on the device(Though I could just use my own computer. Other people at my school didn't have to themselves or didn't have one at all.)


Now lets skip to the next grade. My legal problems didn't occur until I was in 9th grade. Since they considered the first trial such a success(Which is really debatable), they expanded the program to one of the districts high schools. Which consequently was the High School I was headed to. Over the summer I learned new things.
Basically the computers were set with network login credentials. 
And connected to network folders.(Basically they called it the N and Z drive.)
The N drive was our own personal network storage for storing our classwork, etc. So that incase there happens to be a fault with the computer the student wouldn't lose there work.
The Z Drive was where we would put our work when requested to / completed. Inside the Z Drive was each teacher in the school and we just go to there folder and leave the document there with our name and the assignment name.

One day(October 31st, 2008 which was a Friday I remember that day clearly.) I was in my AutoCAD Elective Class.
http://i.imgur.com/dxVhN.png I made a picture of what the classroom looked like.
We used desktop computers while in that class to use AutoCAD.
None of our work is saved to the computers. It is saved to our personal N drive. 
So one day my N drive *cough* *cough* randomly *cough* *cough* decides to not work. Couldn't access it at all. So my teacher told me to fill out a tech report and give it to the tech department so they will fix it.
Since we were very far into AutoCAD my teacher said I didn't have to start from the beginning I just had to catch up whenever they fixed it.
So I was fooling around and there were people next to me. They were bragging about playing pokemon through emulators(O.o). So while I overheard them I was just messing around on the computer. 
I found this location, can't remember accurately but something like, ""\\KleinISD\hrdepartment\"" Basically the location had excel spreadsheets that contained the information of every employee in the district. Around 5000. 
It had Names, Spouses, Addresses, Phone Numbers, Social Security, Insurance Information, Paygrade, etc.
I had an idea of how serious this information was but for some reason I didn't think this file was real / accurate. But anyways the people beside me were seniors. I was trying to show off and even before that they thought I was techie(helping with proxies, games, etc). I don't remember exactly how the conversation was brought up but basically I casually told them looked what I hacked into. I showed them the information and they were amazed. It was near the end of the period and the bell rang.
So in my next period which was geography. Well basically I bragged off to like 1-2 people that were always picking on me about the information I had. They went back to there seat and a couple of minutes before the actual class started the person I bragged to asked the teacher to come. Even though they were far away I could hear what he was saying. Basically what I heard when the teacher responded to the student was jokingly said, "" I don't have any money in my bank account anyways"". I think he thought it wasn't true. :P

Well that period is over and I went to my next elective which was Computer Science? Something like that. Basically they taught excel, powerpoint, etc...
I was bragging to some people / friends that knew me as a technical person about the information. Saying like ""If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn't very technical with computers."" I was trying to make them think I hacked to get the information which I didn't.
Well then next period started which was gym. So we were in the locker room changing. It was like a 5-10 minute wait before we went outside.
So I was on my laptop showing off the information to alot of people. I said ""I could use this make me thousands of dollars."" I was just saying it casually. So we went outside and then the 5 minute bell before class was over rang and we went inside to change back into our regular cloths. Then soon as we were done we went to our final class of the day. Mine was Science. So basically I had neighborhood kid sitting behind me. He was pretty cool. Very technical. I told him the same story about principal, police, and teachers as I did with the people in my 5th period. And I told him the same thing about making money off it.
Was joking around of course. But he thought I was serious for a moment but I told him I was joking and he figured my intentions were non-ill.
So like 3 minutes into my class, a tech department person and the assistant principal for 9th grade came in and looked at me and said don't touch your laptop.
Basically they heard from a person in my gym class saying I hacked to obtain this information and was planning on using it for fraud. They lead me to the assistant principals office and had me explain. I was kept there even after school let out.
I told them I just randomly found this information that same day and wasn't planning to use it. So basically it was a hour after school let out and I was asking if I can leave. They said I could but to return to the office monday morning(It was a friday.) They called my parents about the situation and I had to explain myself clearly to them what happened.
So the weekend passed, my Halloween ruined.
Went to school Monday and went to the office like they told me. 
So basically I told them I told people I was joking around. And I said a few of the names of people I told that were kind of like friends. 
They had me in a separate room when they were asking them questions. But I could hear one of them saying that I told them to say, ""If the police, principal, teachers, ask what they knew about me. Say I wasn't very technical with computers."" to them. I was just joking around when saying that to them to make it seem more impressive...
So basically after all that I was arrested brought down to downtown houston Juvenile Detention center. They Fingerprinted, Took pictures, had me take a drug test(?), they put me on a computer to answer questions to determine physiological state. I was only there till like 5 P.M. and my dad picked me up. 
After the initial suspension went by the school said I was to be placed in Alternative Education Center(Where people who get in trouble get sent). Thats what they first said. Then they said that I was to be placed in a Out of district Alternative Education Center(The place where Multiple Schools ISDs send student who get in trouble while already at the in-school district Alternative Education Center).
So Essentially they skipped me through because they deemed me dangerous to normal people? By the way they would not provide transportation to this place. It was 40 miles away and in the opposite direction of where my parents work.

So essentially my parents decided to move to the Humble ISD school district.
They called before we moved and tried to enroll me in there but they asked if I got into trouble before and my parent had to say yes. So that school district said I would be in the in-district Alternative Education center. So my parents said that was fine and we moved. But then the district later on called my old district, etc. And figure out what happened. And you know what they did? They told my parents after we all moved that I would have to be placed in a out of district alternative education center(I thought the whole point of the original school district placing me there was because they didn't want me in there district at all. They had a PR nightmare with the employees. Didn't think this school was going to do that.). I mean we moved for nothing.

This one provided Bus transportation at a certain point though. It was 15 miles away from where we lived and was in the opposite direction of where my parents worked.
This place was the worst of the worst. This was the place normally districts would send after they got out of juvenile jail for weapons / drugs/ etc. Pic: http://i.imgur.com/OoWqu.png

Actually had one student overdose and die at this place while I was there.

I've been typing for a hour or so and its starting to get annoying so I'll make this part short.
Now after that school year was over we happened to move to Cleveland ISD.
We had computers in certain electives. And me being my dumb self I decide to show-off to make friends since I was in that horrible place for like 7 months and I was the only white person and everyone hated me. And when we moved to cleveland I had no one to talk to for 3 months(Remember me being shy.) 
During that time someone related to the police showed up to give the court documents to me and my parents. The school was charging me with a felony 1st degree saying I had intent to commit fraud which would end me up in Juvenile facility(I was 14 at the time and 15 when this got settled). The court appointed lawyer said that its good to lengthen out the cases and just keep delaying as long as possible. When we finally decided to settle it my lawyer managed to get the judge to only give me 6 months probation with community service. And for some reason Anger management and Theft classes? I lol'd because up until this day I have never yelled at another person outside my family and never got into a single fight. Also the classes were on separate days and like 20 mile drive to there and back. My parents couldn't afford the gas. 

Over the course of a couple of weeks I repeatedly shutdown the thin-client computers to impress people so we wouldn't have to do work...
In my other class on the desktop I managed to get administrator level privileges and was showing off to one kid. I could reset everyones password in the district through some application on the network.(Don't ask me how. I am not a very technical person and hardly can remember anything. I just was looking around and found it.)
So I reset everyones password and reset the entire network. No one could log in. Though they had a backup and fixed it within 20mins.
A couple of weeks later in that class me and the person I was showing off to were friends now. He was very interested in Linux. And I told him about some Distros that I used while I was in my other school and others I found over the summer for example Back-track, #1 tool for script kiddies..
Anyways I burned some discs and he showed me what he burned at home. We booted up the computers we were using in that class with the linux distros each other burned. While I used Puppy Linux before I hadn't used it in a while so I was seeing what updates there were.
But basically a police officer, Principal, and a tech person come in and find see us. I don't know how but they somehow thought I was the caused the issues of the network. Anyways my supposed ""friend"" tells them that he saw me do everything. The only reason he snitched is because he was a senior and 18 and the officer was threatening to take him to jail.
Well they to me to the local courthouse, fingerprinted me, etc. They couldn't do much more because they couldn't contact my parents and since I was a juvenile they drove me back to the school(?) and then the school found out what I did at previous school. They were asking if I had encountered any financial / employee information. I kept telling them no..
I told them how I did everything. That it was all wide open and didn't require any ""Hacker tools"".
Well then school bell ringed and school was out and I asked if I'm allowed to go. They let me get on my bus.
Told my parents later that night what happened. I was scared. But to honest they didn't seem to care anymore.

Anyways I was sent to alternative school again and the same for my friend that did nothing(wth..)
And like a month later early in the morning that same cop arrested me and another cop arrested my friend(He was sent to Jail since he was 18). 
While in the car I ask the cop why he was arresting me again for the same thing. Unresponsive at first I persisted and he said it wasn't related to that. He said that the I.T. department for the school was getting anonymous threats against them and they said we were the only choice.(Which neither I or my Friend did)
Well anyways They take me to the schools police department and fingerprint me again.. and to the courthouse again and then back to school police department.. They said they were going to take me to the Juvenile Center after they inform my parents.. Once again they couldn't get in contact with my parents(Winning!) and they just drove me back the Alternative Education center. Just when the last class period was starting. People saw me get arrested and wondered why I was back here. lol
But anyways I told my parents and they didn't like it in cleveland. It's a horrible drug addict redneck country hick town. And with the 3rd charges we just moved to Dallas, TX.
Anyways the probation was broken by getting in trouble for a 2nd time but my parents didn't care about it anymore. 

Anyways I was forced to drop out at 10th grade because I were to be enrolled they would find me and arrest me for breaking probation from a felony charge.
The place we live in is under the landlords name, etc.
No way they can find me.
Until then I just have to hide out.
My parents didn't seem worried about my education. They didn't even worry about homeschooling. They assume I am smart enough and can figure out what to do when I turn 18.





tl;dr Stupid kid gets caught and gets charged with a felony. Goes to alternative education center for rest of the year. Next year goes different school district. Gets in trouble for something not as big but charged with a misdemeanor, etc. Gets arrested again for something that they accused me of which I didn't do. Breaks probation moved to Dallas. Parents forced me to drop out with 10th grade education and Hiding out till all these Juvenile charges get dropped. Currently just informing myself on the internet and waiting till I am 18 to get a GED.

Now after reading either the long or the tl;dr. I'd like to ask how to get my life back together. The problem was I liked to explore to much and my curiosity got me in trouble but lets  leave that aside.
I have no way of getting proper education. ",AskReddit,How do I get my life back on track?,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mvzpd/how_do_i_get_my_life_back_on_track/,1322755266.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,19.933333333333334
[deleted],1395843726,/r/AskReddit/comments/21eyv1/what_is_my_lifes_purpose/,"Alright, this is a serious question, that I'm hoping someone on the outside looking in can help me understand, explain and/or see. I don't understand what is my purpose here in life. What is my life's purpose? And here's a little about my life. I'm thirty, when I was about seven, I had a good chance of leaving here and dying when I almost drowned in my uncle's pool. However, I was saved by mu uncle and I'm still here. All during my years in Elementary school, I had no friends and when I say no friends, I don't mean like one friend or two friends, I mean, I had no friends. Why? Because during my years in elementary, while all the other kids were busy tongue kissing boys and acting all fast and wild, I was this nerd into studying, books and education and writing and into the arts, so I was without friends and severely bullied several times over. 

When I was in high school, I had zero friends, why? Because at my all black school, while all the other kids were busy listening to hip-hop/rap, smoking weed, doing drugs, having sex and acting wild, I was extremely old fashioned in behavior and in dress, I was interested in what they called ""white music"", I was called the ""black girl, trying to act white"", I was interested in Broadway, the arts - theater, filmmaking, writing, Science, Biology, education and so once again, I was severely bullied to the point where I spent everyday during lunch in the bathroom, because I was afraid of sitting in the cafeteria and then the bullied continued all the way until I graduated - emotional and mental trauma that still haunts and affects me today, which is why no matter how many times a few people tell me how pretty, slim and all that, that I am, I have a hard time believing them, because of the zero self esteem I have now. That all came from the bullying I faced from the time I was in second grade all the way up to when I finished high school. It's also the reason why I have social anxiety disorder and mild aspergers, because I'm afraid/super shy of being around a group of people and being ridiculed and bullied verbally, so I prefer being alone - all by myself. I don't know how to engage in conversations with people, I don't know how to socially interact with people, because every time I tried to do so, I was verbally (and at times physically) bullied and that fucked up my mental and emotional state when it comes to interacting with people.

So, then there's the thing where it's just my mother and I, sure I have two uncles and two aunts, but they're not like the regular aunts and uncles in other people's families. My aunts and uncles won't have anything to do with you, unless you're on their rich financial level - my mom and I are not, so we're shunned by them. The family members we did have, that did show us true, unconditional love (not material love, I mean emotional and family love), they died. Every family member that my mom and I were really loved and were truly close to, God took away and left us with the four who don't give a damn about us - period. The four family members we have left here (and their children), they're mean, cruel, selfish, they treated my grandmother like shit during her last stages of Cancer - Cancer which THEY caused her to have, due to all the emotional and mental stress they put on her on a 24/7 basis. This is how bad those four family members my mom and I have - so anyway, they refuse to deal with my mom and I, because they feel they're too good to be around us, because they have money and wealth and we don't. 

So, it's just my mom and I and it's been hard. My mom is a teacher, I'm a filmmaker. I graduated from high school as a valedictorian, graduated from college with honors. I'm a really smart kid, who is also a teacher part time but a filmmaker full time, being a filmmaker is my dream. It's a dream I was inspired by, because during all my years in school, when I was getting bullied, the only person who kept me from putting a rope around my neck and killing myself was actor, Dallas Roberts. I used to watch all his films regularly, every time I'd come home from school, crying and depressed and suicidal from being bullied, I'd watch his films and I'd feel better, seeing someone do an art that I always tried to do during my years in school (and got ridiculed for it by my fellow peers at school) and his work inspired me and I said, if I can just make it through school and make it through all the B.S. I'm going through in school, maybe one day, I can go become what he is. I can do great art like he's doing. I've always wanted to be a filmmaker, he was just my great inspiration and in a way, he's the reason I'm alive today, he was a inspiration. 

Anyway, my mom and I are poor (and no I'm not asking anyone for anything, so relax, I don't want a handout, I want an answer as to my life's purpose), and when I say poor, I mean, poor to the point where, for all but about three or four years of my living, my mom and I have lived in shelters, and sometimes in storage units. I'm thirty and my mom is in her sixties and we're still homeless. We aren't on welfare or on government assistance, because we don't want a handout or anything handed to us, we want to work hard like everyone else for things, but trying to find a job is hard. You go out and send out resumes for teaching jobs and you know you have the experience but these jobs never call. You send out resumes for ANY job out there and no one calls - what do you do? You lose your place of living. And being homeless in the dead of winter is hard on me, yeah but I don't care about myself so much as I do my mom. She has asthma, COPD and being homeless has been hard and extremely tough on her. She has been battling bronchitis/pneumonia for weeks now and she's been without medicare, because she doesn't have money to buy medicare, so she can't get her sickness treated. Then there are agencies and such that can help people from being homeless - sure, but you call these agencies and such and they're either way too swamped helping others, to be able to help anyone else or they can't help because they themselves have run out of funds to help others. So what do you do? You can't find a job, you lose your place of living, you can't afford medicare, government agencies and such won't help - what do you do? Pray. 

My mom and I consider ourselves to be christians. Before I was born, my mom was poor herself, then she had me and continued being poor - we became poor together. However, we thought we always had God. I as a young thirty year old, have always been loyal to God. I've never had a boyfriend, never committed fornication as they say in the bible. My whole life has pretty much revolved around education and being a christian. So my mom has been praying to God for help, because it says in the bible to just ask God for what you want and he will give it to you, so we pray and fast and pray and fast and pray and fast......and it just goes on and on and on and - NOTHING. It's like we're praying to air, to nothing. Prayers go unanswered. These other ""pastors"", ""ministers"" and ""christians"" are driving around in BMW's and fancy cars with big homes and it seems they're getting ""blessed by God"" and they're crooked as hell but my mom and I, who are devout christians, who defend Jesus on a regular to anyone and everyone, we're struggling worst than a homeless man in the middle of a hurricane in Texas. I mean seriously, all our lives, we've had nothing but bad luck and struggling. All the family members we loves - snatched away, we've had our most precious, personal belongings and keepsakes snatched away from us four times before, because we couldn't pay to keep our stuff in the storage unit we were in, I'm talking about my HS diploma, my graduation photos, my baby photos, the only video I had of my grandmother when she was alive - all gone and sold because we didn't have the money to pay for the storage unit the stuff was all in. And so, I keep asking God, why? WHY is this happening to us? What are we doing (did we do) wrong? We read the bible daily, we don't drink, we don't party, we're christians, so why are we being made to suffer while others aren't. Why does God make good people suffer? 

Then I heard this story of how Jesus and Christians were invented by the Romans and the Pisos family and I though, is that the answer? That Jesus and the bible are all invented things? They aren't real and that's why our prayers are not being answered, because there IS no God? I still don't know the answer to that and that bothers me. I'm starting to think with so many good people suffering, maybe there IS no God, maybe he WAS invented by Rome and is not real.

Then, there the issue with me. I'm 30, I never had a life, and I mean seriously, I never had a life. I never had friends, I don't know what it means to have someone (other than my mom - and her expression of caring and love is very rare) to truly love and/or give a damn about me. My father abandoned my mom and I and that also played a part in fucking up my emotional state, to where it's made me feel like I'm not good enough for anyone because my father left. It made me feel like something is wrong with me, because my father didn't want me as his kid. As a young girl/woman my age, I've never been anywhere, I don't have things other girls/women my age should have, because of being poor. I don't have any self esteem, because when I was younger (not only by those at school, but my four, evil family members and their children), I was constantly made to feel and believe that I was ugly (which I'm not, from what I've been told - one girl said I should even get into modeling because of my pretty face and slim figure and all that but whateve) and just been verbally told everything negative about myself, so I look in the mirror and even though, there's a pretty face there, all I see is ugly. Then I'm the type of person where, I care about everyone - strangers or not. I don't know why that is but I do and I'm not bullshitting when I say that. I literally care about everyone that comes in my path, whether I know them or not. If a stranger on the street needed an umbrella because it was pouring out, I'd take them to a store and use my last five dollars and buy them an umbrella, that's just how caring and nice I am towards people. I care about everyone a little too much. I don't know how to hold grudges and stay angry at people. Someone can throw cold, ice water in my face and I'll be mad for about an hour and then the next hour, I'm back wanting to be their friend again. I don't know why I'm like that, I just am, it's like I only have one feeling of emotion towards people and that's the emotion of being nice/caring. 

Being this way, sometimes people take advantage of my niceness without me knowing it (not sexually, but just by asking me to do things for them and go places with them and knowing I'd never say no to them because I am so nice). Anyway, so with all that, with me caring for everyone - it seems no one gives a damn about me. I never get people asking how I am, unless it's my mom and that's even rare when she does ask me how I am. I don't get calls and emails from people because I don't have friends, and I can't go out and meet friends, because until I get a job and get out from being homeless, I can't go out to dinner and movies and etc., to meet people but I mean, it would be nice to know at least one person gave a damn about me, but no one does. I have no one to talk to about my feelings and emotions and such. As I stated, the family members who did give a damn about me, God snatched away, but no one does anymore and that hurts. I get on the bus and train and I smile at people and/or say good morning, because I was raised with manners and people look at me like they can't stand me and I'm a very sensitive person and that hurts because I don't get why they're doing that to me. I try so hard to impress people and get them to like me and it's like for all my trying, I feel like the most hated person in the world by people. I still get treated like crap by people And it affects me so much where I cry all the time. I cry because I'm tired of people reacting so coldly to me and treating me like crap, I cry because I'm tired of my mom and I being poor, I cry because I'm tired of living day to day for - what? Just to be poor and homeless and to have a shitty life. 

I used to tell my mom when I was younger that when I became an adult, I'd buy her a house and that I'd take care of her, but I can't even do that. My mom and I have never been in a house - ever. At my mom's age, I should be taking care of her and I can't even do that. Then I feel, maybe if I weren't here and my mom were here by herself, she could make it and be better without me. Maybe she wouldn't be homeless or in poverty anymore, because everyone - EVERYONE likes my mom. She has no friends she calls or anything, but everyone my mom meets, she just charms them and they like her - that's not the case with me. I can be nice to anyone and still be treated like crap and I don't get it. So, I say to God at times, if this is all my life is  supposed to be, then just let me go to sleep one night and not wake up. Why do you have me here, God? Just to live day to day and suffer in emotional hurt and suffering and to be in poverty and homelessness until the day either my mom or I die? I mean, what is my purpose in life? What is my mom's purpose in life? My mom is a phenomenal teacher, and she has a lot to offer as a teacher. Teaching is her gift, like being a filmmaker/screenwriter is my gift. I've let people read my scripts and they've been so touched by my writing, that they're moved to tears. I've been told my gift is in filmmaking and writing but how can my mom and I use our gifts, if we can never be in the right type of situation to use them? I just don't get what our lives are for? 

So, last night, I tried taking a few pills and ending it, but here I am, awake another morning. I don't know if maybe self-consciously, I purposely didn't take enough pills or if I did and God just refuses to take me out of this life, because my purpose is to keep suffering, but I am so, so tired of this life, of this world, where everything you want, you can never have, unless you're rich, where people are so mean and cruel to you and treat you like crap, where you pray and pray to a God that you've been told exists and nothing happens. I just - I'd like to know why was I put here? What is my purpose for being here? I think if I weren't here, maybe my mom would be better...If someone can read everything I put here and determine what my purpose is, I'd be forever grateful, because I have no idea and it's to the point where everyday, I'm literally hoping to get struck by a stray bullet or hit by a car so I can be put out of my misery. Because people don't believe this, but every day is like being slowly eaten from the inside out, by a cancer with no hope in sight for being cured....That's what my life feels like and I need answers.

[deleted],1353905733,/r/AskReddit/comments/13sq0o/askreddit_how_would_you_the_socially_awesome/,"Hello /r/AskReddit. I am in desperate need of some advice because I am driving myself CRAZY thinking about this.

Tiny bit of background info about myself: senior in college, living in parents' house until I've saved up enough, employed. I have made some unwise financial decisions in the past, which explains why I haven't moved out yet. I'm taking responsibility for those choices and working to pay off my debts. Also, I am working to repay my parents for having supported me up to this point. 

I have anger problems, and two summers ago my older sister called the police on me for slamming an unlocked door that swung open and scraped her. I had to go to 26 weeks of Domestic Violence class, and I learned how to cope with my anger by reminding myself of the reality of the situation, not my emotional interpretation of it.

Lastly, I have a weiner if that means anything.

To begin, my older sister and I have not had the best relationship. When we were younger, she used to boss me around and torture me if I didn't do what she wanted. Don't get me wrong, we had our fun times as kids but she started to go berserk when she hit puberty. She even almost choked me to death twice. We grew older, and I finally stood up to her. She left me alone and stopped asking me to do anything for her, because I finally had the power to say ""no"".

Even still, I couldn't escape the negativity that she brought my family. She was suicidal throughout middle school and high school, and made life stressful for my family. She was into drugs briefly at one point, dropped out of high school (she got a GED at least), and has had the police called on our house for crazy parties twice (never again thankfully). She has already been married once, and when she tried to divorce him he refused to sign the papers, so she still has a different last name. He took all of her stuff, which was only really an Xbox 360 and a bed, but still. She married this dude after knowing him for three weeks. In Vegas. 

We found out after her last hospitalization that she shows signs of Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. After counseling and anger management classes, she has gotten A LOT better and is, for the most part, a tolerable person. There's just one problem (okay, maybe more than that).

Around 6 months ago, she met a guy she moves in with after like a week. Right before she met him, she broke up with another ""long-term"" boyfriend. I've noticed over the years that she is very needy and co-dependent of other people's identities to sustain her own. If she does not have a boyfriend around, she gets her girlfriends to live with her so she can hang out with them (which has also made me and my mom furious). Thankfully, we've managed to kick out the last few girls who just won't go home. 

Anyway, said dude has a 4 year-old daughter. They get kicked out of their own place because my sister does something crazy (never fully explained to me), and my dad gives them permission to move in. They play it off as ""we'll only be here a few months"" but quickly it becomes evident that this is not the case.

Said dude has a job when he moves in. Great, cool. I approve. He can throw down a little bit for utilities and cover his and his daughter's food expenses. He's a fairly likable dude, and we have a few similar interests. He helps me out a few times, and I'm appreciative. I get along with him and his daughter for the first few weeks. 

Problem is, when he, my sister, and their daughter go out, they shop and eat out. They buy useless groceries (candy, cookies, soda), DVDs, and toys for his daughter. With my dad's credit card. Of course, my dad gives them permission to do this, BUT STILL. Dude is like 23 years old with his own daughter living in someone else's house and spending their money.

I will put a disclaimer here and say that he does get food stamps, so there is food in the pantry that is technically his own. I know this because it has come to the point that they mark their food. Ironically enough, this acts as proof that they don't cook the shit they buy and eat out instead. Fuck me gently with a chainsaw, right?

I'd also like to add that instead of fuming about my problems or passive aggressively snarking at them every chance I could, I sent her a Facebook message that neutrally explained how I felt about the situation. I would say I did well in explaining my feelings rather than reacting to them--I used ""I"" statements to convey what I felt, not what I was assuming about her or her boyfriend, and expressed my concern for our family's finances. I tried to illustrate how her actions have consequences for the people around her and asked that she remain aware of that fact. I also ask her and her BF to get their shit together so they move out within a couple of months. She turns this on me, calls me ""narcissistic"" (which I am, but no more than most?) and says that no one has a problem with them living there. I do what I used to do when we were younger--I backtrack and assume a majority of the blame. I figure, at least I said what I needed to say.

Cut to 4 months ago. He loses his job because of ""discrimination"". He has a medical card and eats baked medicine at work because he's handicapped. When he was younger, a car run over his head (?) and it caused brain damage. Because of this, he is in excruciating pain and needs to medicate frequently. Fine fine fine. He's not mentally disabled by all means, and it seems like he could hold a job if he needed to. My parents keep pushing him to get one, and he says he's looking. In the meantime, he and my sister are still going out to eat, buying stupid shit, and making messes that they generally don't clean up. My mom and I learn to deal by leaving my dad to clean all that up, since we are not the ones responsible for this mess.

I have gotten so frustrated with their inconsideration for my family that I have yelled at both of them twice. I even yelled at the daughter once (and that's how I won my Asshole of the Century® Award). Long story short, they got angry at me for using the shower we share because it woke his daughter up too early. I apologized for that, and tried to learn from my outburst. They forgive me, and eventually we get along (for the most part).

Come August, my grandma decides to visit. My mom, grandma, and I are having a nice conversation when it veers into how we disapprove of my sister's lifestyle. Hearing how upset my mom and grandma are makes me indignant and I decide, that's it, I need to talk to my sister's boyfriend. Note that at this point I am pretty furious in my head, to the point that I try to walk it off the night before. Apparently, this is not very effective...

Next day. It's the morning, my sister and his daughter are downstairs eating breakfast or something. I ask if we can talk man-to-man, and he says okay. I let him know that I don't approve of his spending habits, and I don't approve of the fact that he doesn't have a job. I tell him that I want him to move out by December and stop relying on my dad so much, since my family is not necessarily in the best financial situation of our own. 

Instead of listening and agreeing, he counters that my sister wanted a new HD TV or something and he stopped her from getting it. He then continues to talk about the 3 cars and 4 houses he has owned (!?) and how I don't know shit about his bank account. I start to get furious because I had a mission when I came into this room: he was going to look me in the eyes and tell me that he was going to move out of my parents' house soon. He does this, but I raise my voice, and he starts this ""WOAH DON'T COME AT ME BRO"" BS. I'm standing all the way on the other side of the room! We get into an argument because he says that he will knock me out, then call the police on me and say that I was trying to molest him (I'm gay). And AskReddit, you have to believe me. The look he had on his face when he said it. He shrugs his shoulders slightly and says, ""Well what if I tell them it's sexual assault?"" with this smug asshole face. WHAT. THE. FUCK. I go apexbatshit CRAZY and call him a lying piece of shit who doesn't deserve a speck of my respect. My sister bursts in, guns figuratively blazing, and my dad hauls me off to another room.

My dad is trying to calm me down and is LIVID that I am stirring shit. I keep screaming about how this isn't okay, and how someone needs to do something. BAM, in walks my sister with a fucking medium-sized cutting knife. She starts screaming about how I shouldn't be talking shit about people and points the knife at me. Adrenaline junked up me jumps in front of her and basically eggs her on. At this point I think, at least if I die my parents will be free of this evil bestowed upon us. (It makes sense in my head at the time.)

My dad jumps in, tells her to knock it off, and the fight simmers down. I go downstairs, my sister goes downstairs, it simmers back up. We yell at each other, no less in front of my grandma (yes, AskReddit, I'm a fucking scumbag too). The fight ends when my grandma actually starts to make jokes about it, and I apologize to my parents and grandma for my behavior. Sister's boyfriend? Not a word. Apparently he told my family I was ""all up in his face"" and he said what he did about sending me to jail for sexual assault was ""out of defense"". Biggest pile of shit I have heard or seen with my eyes, hands down. Not in the shit though.

I go to apologize to my sister, but at this point she is talking with my dad and crying. She tells me to leave her alone, I do. I hear afterwards that she is upset because she is trying to convince my dad to either let her get a restraining order against me or kick me out of the house. He doesn't allow either because he knows that I can't afford to move out, and he can't afford to sustain me if I move out.

In the aftermath of this is the first day of my senior year of college. Yeah. My sister is texting me while I drive there, telling me about how I am going to go to jail and how I violated my probation from my previous domestic violence charge. I counter that she pointed a knife at me and has no say over who should go to jail. I let her know that I am done with her manipulating and controlling me, and that she is dead to me. She says the same about me.

So this happened in August and for the past 4 months, I have not said one word to her or her boyfriend. I say hello to her daughter if she says hi to me, and I am nice to her if she is nice to me. I have slammed the door on my sister's face a few times, as an obnoxious way to be like ""SEE!? You're dead to me!"" but I've apologized to my dad who relays the message that she is not happy about it. I would say over the past few months I have learned how to stay in the moment and not let my emotional judgments cloud reality. Simply put, if I yell or scream at them again in any way, I am 100% sure that my sister and her BF are going to find a way to throw me into jail. (I could have my probation reviewed but I didn't do the service hours so I just prefer to wait it out until it expires, which is next year I think.)

This entire time staying out of contact with my sister made me realize the responsibility I have to myself to rid myself of the negative emotions I feel. As I'm sure you know by now, the events are very vivid in my mind but I am completely honest with myself when I say that I am mostly to blame for how things transpired that day. For one, I did not talk to my sister's BF ""man-to-man"". I raised my voice and unleashed the worst aspects of my personality for people who frankly, don't deserve it. They're not spending the money that I've earned, and they're not living in a house that I'm paying mortgage or even a rent for. This is the part of me letting go of my controlling behavior.

Lastly, I also recognize that a big factor in this equation is my dad. He is the one giving them the money / his credit card (!) every time they ask for it. When he says no, my sister flips out (part of her BPD) until she gets what she wants. We are hoping that she matures emotionally soon, but she's 23 and while we've seen progress, I can tell that she is a huge burden to my parents, especially my dad. He just hides behind a passive aggressive attitude while doing his best to placate her because he has dealt with her suicidal threats before and he just does not want that at all. Saying yes to her is the easiest way for him to ""live"" his ""life"".

I definitely know that my sister and her BF share a part of the blame in our fights as well, and I think I get so angry with them because literally NO FUCKS GIVEN. This is especially why I freaked out when he shrugged off what I had to say like it doesn't matter. This is my biggest issue. I want him to know that he is not welcome to use my family for its financial resources because he's too lazy to go out and get a job. I want to express to him the amount of disapproval that I have for his lifestyle in way that impacts him, not just by screaming at him. How would you deal with this in a way that can improve the situation without overstepping your authority? I know that I am moving in a few months and that this won't technically be an issue for me then, but I still feel like it's my ""duty"" to let him know where he stands. I know it's not my place, but after everything I have gone through with my sister I am still in ""fight"" mode. I admit this is a waste of energy, but I just don't like the way my family is handling this situation. I want to do SOMETHING. Question is: how?

[deleted],1333403082,/r/AskReddit/comments/rq53i/meme_presenters_versus_meme_dissectors_two/,"This isn't a question, as much as a ""I just had a thought. What do you think?"". I guess this post is like an informal version of presenting a paper for peer-review. Is my model over-simplified in any important ways? Can it be further refined? Am I missing something that would invalidate it?

It has recently occurred to me that there are two different kinds of people: meme presenters, and meme dissectors.

Meme presenters pride themselves in presenting surprising, counter-intuitive, relevant, or otherwise interesting ""facts"". However, there is almost no rigor regarding the reliability of those facts. The source - such as ""I read it in such-and-such a newspaper"" or ""The host of such-and-such TV/radio show said this"" - is mentioned only in passing. What is implied is: You can trust me on this, I got it from an authoritative source.

Meme dissectors are more rigorous with knowability. They too like to present relevant or surprising or counter-intuitive facts, but the meat of what they present in conversation comes when they then say ""Apparently there was a study set up like this, and there was a correlation between this outcome and people with that characteristic"" or ""They think that this blurry area of this image points towards such and such an object or effect, so while it could be nothing, it at least points towards the next area for investigation"" or ""In my experience, this has been true every time, so while it's possible that it's not true all the time, I think it's pretty reliable"". They are much more rigorous about why they have good reason to believe that the fact is indeed true, they recognize that their conclusion is only one interpretation of the data, they understand the motivations/agendas of the people pushing the ""fact"" and how that leads to bias… and they can think of an unbiased way (even if impractical or hypothetical) about how the truth could be established.

(If you don't have much time to spare, you may wish to skip from here to the part about the epistemology of cooking shows).

It seems to me that among engineers, techies, redditors, and atheists, there is a greater fraction of meme-dissectors than in the general population. My mother and her friends are definitely meme-presenters. My friends and my coworkers are definitely meme-dissectors. (Then again, this may just have to do with what the situation is, at any given time. In some social situations, dissecting memes takes more time and thought and concentration and rigor than anyone would like to use at the moment, so maybe the difference is not so much ""kinds of people"" as much as ""kinds of conversations"". Then again, I bet some people prefer one kind of conversation and some people prefer the other).

In my experience, we all start out as meme presenters. Children are still using new facts as they building blocks for the web of causal relationships in the world around them, so any fact that would greatly enrich a child's model of this web makes the child impressed and appreciative. And kids know it, too, because they love surprising other kids with ""Well, did you know that… Yeah! Wow!"". But then we learn that people have agendas, and that some people honestly believe things that are false, so we need to be skeptical, we need to ask ""How do you know?"", and ""What beliefs does this new fact invalidate, and how solid are those beliefs?"", and ""What would we expect to observe if this is true, or if this is not true?"". However, some people apparently never do develop this sense very strongly. I have been in many conversations recently where someone says something about homeopathy or acupuncture or astrology, or about orthomolecular nutrition or drinks with ""chlorophyll extract"", or about Barack Obama… and everyone else is impressed, or shocked, or curious, or says ""My gosh, this means I should do X Y and Z""… and I'm the only person in the room who says ""Whoa whoa whoa. This sounds inconsistent with some pretty well-established models, with our understanding of how this kind of thing works"" or ""What mechanism could possibly link the things that happen in this real with the things that happen in this other realm?"" or ""How could anyone possibly know this?"". I am met with scorn: ""You can't possibly be claiming to know more about this than the guy who they had talking about it ON A TV SHOW"". And then I fumble trying to explain ""It's not a matter of knowing more or less, it's a matter of understanding how knowledge works, of interpreting data, of having a vague idea about what forces impact what kinds of systems"".

(Here are some easy examples: You don't have to be a biologist to suspect that tayloring someone's diet to their blood type is a ridiculous idea - you just need to have paid attention in high school when they explained what causes different blood types, and what kinds of vitamins/minerals and amino acids and fats/carbs a human body needs and why. You don't have to be a psychologist or neuroscientist to know that the position of celestial bodies during someone's birth will not promote this or that personality trait. You don't have to be a physicist to realize that magnetic/ion bracelets are thoroughly BS. You don't have to be a chemist to realize that homeopathy can't possibly work. You don't have to be a statistician to see that yes, we can pretty much know for sure that vaccines don't cause autism, to roughly the same extent that [we can know that reindeer can't fly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJTUAezxAI#t=3m18s). And don't even get me started on Christianity).

But this isn't just about skeptics' pet peeves. Those are black and white. (Of COURSE astrology and homeopathy and magnetic bracelets are BS). Usually things are fuzzier. Here's a more illustrative example;

The epistemology of cooking shows:

I was at the gym the other day, and they had a cooking show on TV. (I include this detail as a way to imply that I would never dedicate time solely to watching a cooking show, although I'll be honest and admit that this implication may or may not be correct. Anyways…). The chef was talking about how to make a certain kind of dish. He made several generalizations of the form ""Adding this substance will really bring out the flavor"" or ""This ingredient and that ingredient are a great combination"". Always stated with so much conviction! To each of these claims, my reaction (which I thought to myself on the treadmill) was a disapproving ""How can you know that?"" or ""What does it even mean to say that?"". For example, some of his claims were about taste and flavor, which are subjective experiences and personal tastes. Unless you run a controlled experiment, asking a whole lot of people whether they prefer this version of the dish or that version of the dish, can you really know that adding this twist to the recipe really makes it better? All you can know is that ""I like it much better this way"", or ""I tried this once and it was a big hit with all my friends"" or ""…with all the people who tried it that night at the restaurant"". And even if you did know that - and even if you ran a large pharma-style double-blind controlled experiment - does that mean it's ok to say ""This makes the dish better"" in such a simple and absolute way? Whatever happened to *De gustibus non est disputandum*? The chef's statements were like saying ""People who do X are more attractive than people who do Y"" or ""This chord progression makes the song be better than that chord progression"". Isn't it necessarily dishonest to make that kind of a statement without preceding it with ""In my opinion…"" or ""Once I asked a whole bunch of people and they pretty much all agreed that…""? Unless you can really point to the neural pathways that cause people to react to one thing more positively and to another thing more negatively, and explain why these pathways are probably present in almost all people (e.g. they are formed in utero rather than being significantly shaped during upbringing), I don't see how it's ok to claim ""People will like the dish better if you do X"" so authoritatively. Of course, it would be absurd to expect the Food Network to use neuroscience to back up claims. But it really seems to me that ""In my opinion / According to everyone I have asked…"" is not too much to ask.

Afterwards, I tried to explain this to my girlfriend, and her primary reaction was feeling angry at how I apparently thought that I know more about cooking than the host of some show on the Food Network. I certainly do not. I probaby know less about cooking than the average guy my age. But it's not about thinking that what the host said was incorrect. It's about thinking that the way he said it implied an unreasonable amount of certainty, knowledge, authority, and/or experience. She tried to tell me that he DOES have that much authority, since he's been doing this for a living for many years, and they picked him to be on TV. I tried to tell her that no human being can honestly make that kind of claim. She tried to tell me that the ""in my opinion / as far as I have observed"" qualifiers were implied in what he said and that it was ok for him (or the video's editors) to leave them out. I disagreed, and said that at a gut level, I would have felt much more comfortable trusting him if he had included the qualifiers. (That having been said, I do still want to try out a couple of his ideas…)

Maybe I am unusual in this way because of the kind of work I do. I don't want to give too many details, but my work involves deciding how to do some engineering analysis that could easily cause hundreds of deaths if done improperly. If you've seen videos or articles about large engineering creations failing (or almost failing) spectacularly, my work involves developing equations that describe those failures and requiring engineers to do certain kinds of analyses to ensure that their creations will not experience those problems. So I'm basically in a group of scientists that must satisfy some government regulators by saying ""The engineers are doing this in such a way that those catastrophes will be avoided"". A sentence often heard in my group - be it when talking with government regulators, with engineers, or just among ourselves - is ""How do you know?"". We may say ""When you lay things out this way, that will make it less prone to that kind of failure"". But laying things out that way is more expensive, so… how do you know it will protect us from that failure? Or: This failure mode always happens before that failure mode, so you don't really need to worry about that failure mode as much, just test for this one. Well, how do you know? This change will have a negligible impact on the safety of the system. How do you know? This test covers not only this thing, but any things that are the same size or smaller. How do you know? The question is so pervasive that most of us (especially our most senior researchers, the geniuses who have been in this line of work for years, who have overseen dozens of test programs and authored engineering textbooks and industry standards) always start sentences with ""In my understanding…"" or ""In my experience…"" or ""As shown by this data…"" or ""The trend in this relationship…"" or ""My intuition, which could be totally wrong, tells me that what would probably happen is something like the following… but yes, we should find out for sure, because I can already foresee the possibility of slightly different outcomes, so we should't rely on this expectation"". And we finish sentences by saying things like ""I say this never happens because we always design using this guideline, and always assume that the environment will be roughly like this. But if we disregard the guideline, or change our assumptions about what this thing experiences, then yes, this other failure mode could start to dominate"". Could it fail in such and such a way? We don't just say ""Yes"", we say ""It has happened once or twice"" or ""It's a pretty extreme corner case but it could happen maybe once every couple decades"" or ""Only if this and this and this all happened at the same time, so the probability is negligible"" or ""absolutely impossible"". How do you know? ""Because this other thing would happen first, as predicted by our models"" or ""as shown by this series of tests"" or ""as suggested by this one test which admittedly isn't necessarily representative"". We don't just have to know what we know, we also have to know with what certainty we know it, and what we would have to do to know it with more certainty… because our job is to define and request and oversee and interpret (and apply the results of) the research that expands our knowledge of how these kinds of systems fail. The question I answer isn't ""How long can this very large and expensive thing last before it's unsafe to not replace it"", the question is ""What tests do we have to run in order to sharpen our understanding of what will happen to this large and expensive thing after a few decades, so that we can determine what failures to protect it against, and whether that can be done safely and reliably… And no, we just can't build a whole other giant thing and break it, so any data that we can afford will only give part of the answer"". Anytime I meet anyone in a professional environment and they say ""Oh, this never happens"" or ""This failure mode always happens before that failure mode"" without that key piece of metadata (how do you know, with what confidence), then I regard their statement as useless. So it's possible that my career has led me to expect too many qualifiers in people's claims… but I don't think my expectation is that unreasonable.

One final thought: I think that this line of thinking reveals why I, and many people I know, prefer to read blogs instead of print periodicals. Print periodicals just say ""So-and-so, an authority on the subject, says this"". Blogs (and NPR, and a few other traditional publications) often go further and say ""You may be wondering how they can know this"" or ""…what leads them to claim this. They did a study, and surprisingly, this phenomenon was correlated with this characteristic…"" and admittedly ""Yes, the causality isn't clear, but the correlation is definitely there"". Is that too much to ask?

Is it so uncommon for most people to distrust a source when the source makes claims that are to be trusted on the basis of authority, without any metadata about how they know this and with what confidence and based on what observations?

It seems like an almost binary property: Some people, and some publications, care not at all about that kind of metadata, while some others (like myself) are ready to disrespect a source based solely on the lack of this kind of metadata (even in matters as inconsequential as cooking).

**WARNING:** All the examples I give are from the university I went to, but I went to a highly acclaimed American school and I know many people who got a lot less from other ""better"" schools who paid a lot more than I did. It also goes without saying that all of these examples are much worse at most American ""party"" schools where they prioritize teaching and career prep even less, and I know a lot of people who went to these types of schools.

**I know what you're thinking: ""This is some kid who didn't do well and didn't find a job so he is blaming his problems on something else."" Actually, this is further from the truth.** 

**I graduated with an engineering degree with a high GPA and I easily got a good job in my field after graduation. I am satisfied with my life at this point.** I definitely learned a lot in college, but I can't help think that I could have learned a lot of this on my own without spending 10s of thousands of dollars or at least what I got out of college was not worth the price. Even with an academic scholarship for 50% off tuition, I still paid a ton of money. I was really funny to see that athletes got priority in an institution that was supposed to be about learning. I actually almost became a starter on one of our best varsity teams since I was recruited, but I figured it would be a waste of time since I don't want to spend 4 years playing sports instead of learning. Athletes had the same scholarship I did, but with a 0.5 point lower GPA requirement and with preferential treatment in course scheduling. I get that athletes need to get priority to schedule things around practices and games, but this just proves that American colleges prioritize sports over actual learning.

I used to be a college advocate because people in my industry frequently told me that they prefer college graduates over self-taught people because in college you learn the meaning behind all the principles that you are taught and you could therefore be creative and extrapolate them to engineering new things. Despite this argument, I kept noticing that all I need from college are these key explanations, and professional instruction, which is what I got, but I still think the price I got them for is a rip-off. Some of the best professors I ever had agreed with me. In class they would say ""Tuition is ridiculously expensive and the price that you guys pay per hour to be here is unjustified so it's in your best interest to pay attention.""

I think that this is caused by colleges falling prey to chasing profits. **There is nothing wrong with chasing profits since it is a great incentive structure to make your product better, unless it causes your product to get worse...**

American colleges nowadays prioritize selling ""The College Experience"" over learning and being tough. They love to raise tuition so that they can pour millions into sports facilities, professors' research that sometimes isn't very useful, and random events that totally overpower the actual objective of being there: actually learning. I loved the ""College Experience."" Partying and having fun with friends and going to events and being able to discipline myself as an adolescent to get my life together was great...but I can do all of that without paying tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately this has created a perverse incentive structure where student ""happiness"" is prioritized over learning. Colleges will get more student satisfaction and good reviews if they make their classes easy, super informal, and have the professors bow down to the students. American adolescents love this type of stuff since they are immature and have been sold this type of lifestyle. And I don't blame them. Why would you go to a school with hard classes and strict professors, when you can get the same degree from a school with a similar ranking/reputation with easy classes and pushover professors?

I went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. 

So many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought ""You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award."" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time ""Full Time"" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work

Not all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the ""Canvas"" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like ""pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study"" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: ""OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info."" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**

I did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **""If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.""** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. 

**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**

1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**
2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**
3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.
4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).
5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)
6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.
7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the ""less practical"" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**

My favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**

It was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or ""book smart,"" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.

Most of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(

I really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.

**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB. Hire people based purely on their skills and abilities, and not whether or not they spent a bunch of money to get a fancy title next to their name.**",college,"American Colleges are a Scam, even for STEM Degrees.

I went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. 

So many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought ""You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award."" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time ""Full Time"" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work

Not all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the ""Canvas"" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like ""pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study"" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: ""OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info."" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**

I did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **""If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.""** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. 

**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**

1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**
2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**
3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.
4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).
5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)
6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.
7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the ""less practical"" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**

My favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**

It was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or ""book smart,"" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.

Most of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(

I really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.

**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB. Hire people based purely on their skills and abilities, and not whether or not they spent a bunch of money to get a fancy title next to their name.**",college,"American Colleges are a Scam, even for STEM Degrees.

I have no idea what happend. I woke up this morning and now I am going to start going through a divorce. 

Let me give you a backstory/life story: 

Growing up I was always a *fat* kid. I was always teased at school and my self esteem was always low. In 5th grade I moved to a different part of the state that was higher income and less poverty. This was the turning point to my life, it seems like kids were better behaved, but the teasing was still there. In 8th grade we moved again to a lower income part of the state again (not the same one as previously mentioned). It was not as bad but considering I had to make new friends my middle school years were pretty horribly. Highschool came and I decided to go to the same highschool that I was going to attend before we moved in 8th grade. I got to befriend all my friends again. The only problem was that my self esteem was still really low. I was always a *Charles Barkley"" type athelete, loved playing basketball and was usually the top 5 players in the school, but I was never selected to a basketball team because ""i was too out of shape."" No one understands the love I have for basketball and this just contributed to my low self esteem. I decided to join the football team but the coach didn't really seem to ""care"" and my concerns were validated when he transferred to a school with a bigger football budget. That was 10th and 11th grade. 

**Senior Year**

We had a new coach that cared for his players. I rejoined the football team. When I joined the football team in 12th grade I was about 270ish pounds. Like I said, for my size I was always atheletic and could outrun many smaller folk on the team and every linemen on the team. I decided that I really had to change my lifestyle and was at 185 a couple months into my senior year. I got my first job as a cashier making minimum wage. 100% of my money went towards rewarding myself. I bought close, nice shoes, and $100 cologne. By this time I was extremely popular with the ladies. I was tall,dark, and hansome. 6'2 185 and lean. The problem was that my self esteem was still pretty low and I still had a hard time with girls. I quit the football team because they wanted me to be a linemen when I felt more of a tightend and the coach wouldn't have it. I started focusing in school and at work. One day at work a coworker mentions why I dont speak to girls, I lie to him and tell him that I do but no around people. We start talking and decide to have a competition to see who can get the most numbers by the end of the week. We bet $100, and since we were making 7.25 this was a big deal and i was taking it VERY seriously. I was up to about 12numbers when a girl comes by me, we talk and I ask for her number which she gives it to me. I had to interest in her but it was another tally. A week later she calls me and it so happend to be on my day off. I didnt know this until later but the girl gave my number to her friend and we hit it off. Her friend gave the okay and we started dating. 

**The dating**

This was my first real date and we really hit it off. Stupid things happend 3 months into the relationship and we were pregnant. She comes from an extremely christian household and if i wanted to be with my kids we **had** to marry. So anyways I didn't mind marrying her because deep down I knew that's what I always wanted. With my garbage pay I furnashed my bedroom at my parents house (keep in mind i'm still 17) and we got married and she moved in. Things took a turn for the worst at this point because I started to know her personality more. I always wanted a women just like my mom, a true ""stay at home"" mom. I told her this and she got mad and said ""Go fuck your mom then"". She is didnt want to do anything and just stayed in bed all day and watched tv. She could have taken this opportunity to learn how to cook &amp; clean properley. I talked to her about my dislike of lazy people but she said she was not lazy she was just shy doing stuff because it was not her house. We decided to move to her parents house, but guess what, same issues but this time I wasnt only living with my lazy wife. I was living with her crazy Christian mom, and my crazy sister in law. To make things worst I quit my cashier job because I had enough of that place, and I couldnt find another job for months on end. So now I was a lazy bum living off of her parents. After about 6 months I found a job at a call center and we moved back to my parents. At this point she became better but still was lazy. I would come home some days and ask her for a back massage and she would respond with a variety of no's ""Because it's not like i'm working in construction"". She always took it too far but I kept my mouth shut. She always degraded me, i felt worthless. She said I wasnt a man because I couldnt provide a house for my family. Keep in mind that she  never could hold a job, since we have been together she has had two jobs in childcare which she could only keep for 2 days exactly before she was fired and I never forced her to work again. So we were living off my $10 an hour job and she expected me to buy her a home. She never took into consideration all the OT and hard work I put into that place. 

**Fights**

Over the last couple of years we got into 3 major fights. Each of the fights I was the aggresser telling her how I felt. In EVERYone of the fights she agreed that I was in the right. The first fight was because I told her I wanted her to be more like my mom. The 2nd fight was me telling her that she needed to grow up and if she was not going to work, she needed to start learning how to be a stay at home mom. And the 3rd fight from a few months ago ... well ill explain later. After each of the fights everything would be good for about a week and then she started slowly going back into her old habits. 

**2nd Baby**

About 3 months into my job we got pregnant again. We were on the pill and this was a miracle baby, and yes he is mine. I worked hard and exactly a year into the job, I was promoted to manager. She cared, not much. What no one realises is that this company is huge. We have 40 locations and nearly 20,000 associates worldwide. At age 19 I became the youngest manager by a couple of days in company history. I also only had less then a year of being on the job. There are about 12 other managers in my location and each one is at least 9 years older then me and had worked here 5yrs before being promoted. I bought her a home and I fully furnished it. This would solve the problems right? She now has no excuses because we have our own home and she has no excuses. WRONG, she was still extremely lazy and it got to a point where the only way I could stand being with her is to start smoking pot. I started smoking pot really heavily because I was able to be happy, even when I was angry. But things never go my way and we got into our **3rd fight.** In this fight i TOLD her everything that was on my mind to the point where I was crying like a little bitch. She acknowledged everything I said and claimed I was in the right. That fight worked wonders and she started cleaning and cooking and just in a better mood every day. This fight was about two months ago and again after about a week she started being lazy again.  But this time it would flucuate, she would be lazy some days and good other days. I quit smoking pot about a month ago because i felt that was in the best interest of my kids. 

**Countdown to today, the breakup**

Don't want to go to much into our sex life, Let me just say it was HORRIBLE. We never did anything fun, she grew up in a christian household and only wants vaginal penetration. It's frustrating when you want to have a fun sex life and the other person wants none of it. I started lurking /r/sex and was really jealous of how some women treated their husbands. 

I went to my friends house from highschool that I havnt seen forever. He is also married and that's when I realized something needed to change. I can't wait, as my wife claims, for my wife to change. I'm not going to sit around and be misserably until my wife decides she is ready to make something of her self. SHE HAS NO DRIVE, no dreams, no hopes. We're living paycheck to paycheck and thats not how I want to live my life. I would have loved for her to study and get a degree while I worked my ass of for her. But I love my kids and decided I would not mention anything and I would stay with her until she made the changes she claims take time. 

**2 days ago**
I wake up and she is up with the kids watching TV in the living room. For some reason she is in a pissed off mood and starts saying crap. She put me in a horrible mood, then she notices i'm mad and starts to be nice but i guess she expected me to be nice back? Anyways at night she starts bitching that I was an asshole all day and this and that, and then I mentioned she started it from the start of the day and put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. She appologizes and we went to sleep. 

**Today** 
I wake up, she's folding some clothes and first thing I hear is ""I slept really unconfortable you kept *@$@#$@#$!"" I said okay whatever I'll sleep in the living room tommorow and this apperently made her angry and started being a bitch. I told her that she is going to put me in a bad mood like yesterday but she didnt give a shit and stated that I'm only in a bad mood because i want to be (Yes i enjoy being in a bad mood). I had to pickup my transcript and a haircut so i just showered and left. I come back and I'm still upset, i sit down and start watching TV. She sits down next to me and I scoot over a little. Then she says wow this and that and whatever but we just sit there any watch TV. 5 minutes later I get over being mad from the morning but then she touches me and I jokingly move my arm as if I dont want to touch her with a grin on my face. She gets up without a word and lays down in the bedroom. Half an hour later I go into the room and tell her to get up and do something. She doesnt say anything. I tell her to move or scoot over so I can lay down before work (always lay down an hour before work) she calls me a motherfucker and goes to the living room and just starts watching TV. I go to the living room and tell her what a worthless piece of shit she is and then she says ""I'm leaving you asshole"". I was actually happy when she said this, although she always  does this, she always threatens to leave me, and it was a habbit because she would threaten her parents before we got married. She called her family to pick her up and at this point i started feeling regret because I LOVE MY KIDS. I told her if she wanted to try to work it out and she said she was done, I asked if she could play stay and that I would move into the extra room. She refused. I got ready and came to work (where i am now) I was holding back tears the whole time just thinking of my kids. After eating breakfast of Mcdonalds (At 4PM since the bitch cant even cook for me) and started thinking of the feature I started to feel better. I dont feel like crying, i still miss my kids a lot though and dont know how i'm going to feel apart from them. Typing this out made me realize that it's not worth it for me or the kids to live around an unhappy relationship. I still love the bitch to dead, she's the mother of my two kids. It's not that easy to get over someone even if you are not compatable. I just dont know what to do moving forward and if anyone, at least one person read this I would be so greatful. Am I in the wrong? Where do I go from here? I Cant stand being alone, i feel i need to start dating to get over the relationship. Someone give me advice!

**MY Problem** 
My self esteem is even worse then when I was 15. Since I have been married i have gained around 200LBS!!! I tore a ligament and was unable to afford surgery on it (Before i worked) and was in bed resting it for a long time. My wife was pregnant at the time and needless to say that along with my new job at a call center it just got too bad. I'm 6'2 380lbs and who would want to date a fatass with two kids? I'm only 19 my birthday is in a week. I never liked clubs and I know my relationship is OVER today and there is no turning back, for the better. My kids will always be my kids and I will always support them.

**TL;DR I married the first girl that showed me love because I was volnurable. We had are HIGHS and our LOWS but it is time to end our relationship. We have two kids together and I have no money to my name, no starting point, and don't know how to move forward.**",AskReddit,"Reddit, Can you help me move forward to the next stage in my life?",http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y8k0o/reddit_can_you_help_me_move_forward_to_the_next/,1345016476.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,16.893333333333334
Throwaway39334,1295344663,/r/AskReddit/comments/f4cqd/reddit_my_mom_is_on_the_brink_and_i_feel_like/,"Please, I can barely think straight I'm so nervous, and I have no idea how else to begin this. It's 3:30 am right now and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope and I need someone to listen to my pathetic story, even though most of you may not be able to relate to it. I want to apologize because I just realized how long this is getting but I feel like I need to get this off of my chest.  

To start, I'm middle eastern and my mom and dad have been married for more than 26 years. Their marriage was a traditional parents pick who they marry type thing. Because of this, my mother's life has been absolute hell because of my father. 

Just to give some background on him(I'm trying to show why this is so confusing for me), he moved to the U.S. back when immigration wasn't as strict as it is now, in hopes of providing for his family back home(My mother and her 3 children living with his family). After making it here, he got us all in and naturalized( I wasn't even one year old when I got here). His intentions seemed good.

However his upbringing may have been worse than my own. His mother was controlling and abusive. His father wasn't very influencial even though he says that he respected him and admired him(societal norms: son respects father). He had nine brothers and sisters all under the same third world roof. He grew up on hard work and his own country's idea of what things are and how they should be. Skipping forward, he gets married off to my mom. He was the only one of his family to get out of there and get a steady job to pay for the rest back home.

I'll skip the details but basically, when I first started noticing that my parents were fighting, when I was nine, I tried to keep it secret from anyone else around me. This would later manifest in my excessive nervousness and inability to remain calm under pressure later in life. My mother always tried to stay together with my father for the sake of the children and he would be stuck in his traditional ways of the man should be the authority figure and everyone should listen to him, and would throw that in her face. I should also mention that we are all extremely religious, even now more so than ever to Islam.( I don't blame Islam, I blame the norms behind misconstrued interpretations of it) But anyways, he would scream at the kids and at her and would at the same time express feelings of love. He would buy us things but yell at us. He would be ""normal"" for a week and then one little thing going wrong would set him into a frenzy. In hindsight, it looks like he's got some sort of psychological condition probably from the stern raising he was given mixed with the culture shock of being in a different society. 
This would ultimately leave my mom regretful of her situation with him but given her upbringing as well, she would always think of the children first. She maxed out credit cards and destroyed her credit to take care of us when he refused to offer even a cent. This is while they are living together too by the way. He would purposely put her in positions of relying on him so he could verbally and psychological abuse her and tell her how worthless she was and how much of a terrible woman she was. How she was ""disobedient"" to her husband and how her family members were all terrible. The irony is that HIS side of the family ended up being filled with sociopaths and all sorts of fucked up people like him, while hers was the most calm and nice part of my childhood that I can remember. He didn't need a wife, he needed a slave.
Nevertheless, I am probably about 12 or thirteen when things get out of control, and i can't even begin to fathom whats happening and why. I was too wrapped up in my own selfish life that i never stepped back and looked at what was happening to my mother. She had suicidal thoughts for so long, but because she was extremely religious and that Islam forbids suicide, she could not act on her desires. She was trapped and was spiraling. Her friends offered the typical advice of just leaving him, but the reality was that he would never give her the divorce and that he had her financially stuck. She had no family nearby to go to, she was living paycheck to paycheck and still going deeper into debt just to be part of his sick fucking game of ""I'll pay when I want to"". And this part really kills me....all the while I kept whining ""please don't leave dad, please stay with him."" He was so good at turning me into his puppet, and making me feel like he cared, that he knew that I would guilt her into staying. I cried so much every time she stormed out saying she wasn't coming back. I would chase after her and try to keep this disfunctional group that i called a family together because I couldn't bare to see my parents break up....But she would. She would stay because of her kids. Meanwhile my older brother and sister who were in high school at the time were making her life even worse. They were hanging out with the wrong people, getting in trouble, and from a objective standpoint, being teenagers. But it wasn't helping the family troubles. He would throw that in her face and say that his kids were terrible and that he hated them. This would set her off like nothing else, and cause more fights. Things would calm down, then start up again. This continued for years.

One summer when things were looking up for my parents staying together, they decide to go back to Pakistan to visit. That's where this all started by the way, i kept forgetting to mention. Everyone is gritting their teeth and pretending to be normal but soon the fireworks start, and my dad's side of the family begins to fill his head with more lies about how my mom is an awful person. To be frank, these were small petty squabbles that were used to start a fight for no reason.....Okay I've trailed off much to far. I really do apologize, but I feel like you can't understand without knowing the backstory.

By the time I got to the age that I was aware of everything, I was sick of all of this shit. I am a very skinny guy and I would often wonder what would happen if I had to physically try to stop my father from going over the top. It scared me.

My brother and sister are both with my mother about what is happening, but they are living two seperate lives. My brother is now engaged to a girl he found and truly loves while he has his own career( USMC), but my sister was married off the same way as my mother was. I don't know the details of why this was allowed, I know that my dad would want it but I don't know why my mom let it happen. This was three years ago.

The real problem starts here. My father was and still is in my opinion, insane. He is genuinely happy and tries to be kind sometimes but othertimes, to be fair, i think in his head he sees what he does as righteous and still psychologically ends up torturing my mom and sister. He picked a man that was a high ranking officer in the Pakistani military and married her to him. 

She lived with him for two years and had a daughter. While this happened, my father went over for some more ""traditional"" faux visiting and niceties. While he was there, after having another petty argument with my sister, he tells her husband everything that he shouldn't have told him. 

As I mentioned, her husband is living by his society's norms, and is suddenly finding out that when my sister was younger she dated guys(WHORE!) and went out at night( DISOBEDIENT WRETCH!) etc etc. Since that day, he made her life a living hell. He would probe her with this and say that she's a whore because her father said so. He goes on and on and tortures her everyday with things like this. This year my mother bought her a plane ticket to come back for a bit. 

Out of left field, my little brother is born. He is now two years old and my mother is worried about his future as well now. As I mentioned before, she would die before putting him up for adoption, its out of the question of any of you are thinking that. He's not the burden, my father is.

Reddit, I come to you in my hour of need. I am nineteen and my mother has just told me all of this and more and I refuse to let this go on any longer. I have watched and remained silent for too long. I never want to see her break down like that again. After hearing her I wanted strangle the life out of that bastard. You have no idea of how much hate I have harbored for him, how much he's taken from us. At the same time my conscience reminds me that I don't know everything and that he did provide for us as well, even though to me it looked like he was throwing money at his problems,  and no matter how fucked up he is, a part of him is still the father that loved his kids and his wife for the first five years of his marriage. 

I am trying to stay rational about this and think of what's best for everybody. He isn't psychotic all the time, only when he gets into a fight and you don't back down. I know my brother is coming home in a week and then the whole family will be together. We live in my mom's house which, because of her credit she had to have my brother co-sign for. The reason we can't immediately kick him out is because the cars that me and my mom drive were both taken out under loans by him. Like I said, either moments of genuine compassion or opportunities for leverage. I know for a fact(he's done it in the past), if we tell him to leave, he'll take the cars and then we'll be fucked. My mom needs to drive to work and I need to drive to college and work. My credit score was like 730ish the last time i checked, since I only had one credit card and hardly a year's worth of credit history. The last time he took the keys for his car, i tried to go with my mom to a dealership but we couldn't get approved because of it. One guy even symathized and told me to start up like 4 lines of credit so that there would be a better chance of getting approved sooner. I have yet to do that and may have to, because I am afraid if I buy a cheap car for a few hundred bucks, which is all i can truly afford, I will drown in repair bills. 

Meanwhile my sister's husband is berating her through email and saying that if any harm comes to his daughter, he will murder her relatives in Pakistan. And to be honest, with the amount of authority he commands, its not out of the question. She got through security at the airport there practically on a red carpet because of a few phone calls he made. I remember before her wedding when I drove around with him for a bit. He did whatever the hell he wanted and would simply throw out his rank and name and get a salute to continue on. The truth is that he wants her to come back there so he can hurt her, which I'll be damned is going to happen. And seeing as how the country is so corrupt that not even the court system is safe from the military, pressing charges isn't exactly the best option. This is just one big mess for her and her daughter. She shouldn't go back but is almost thinking of it because she knows that he is still a good father to her daughter. She even said that he reminded him of our father in his shifting attitude which scared me the most.

I don't know what to do. My grades are impeccable and whether or not anyone believes it, after witnessing many different topics on reddit, my eyes opened to the fact that i didn't want to continue pursuing my current degree, so i switched to engineering. This means that I will now require an additonal 2 years to get my associate's for that and then another 2 for my bachelors. Basically I'm so focused on school i feel like I am shirking my responsibilities as a son. I don't want my mother living with this man anymore and i don't want my sister living with her husband. I want for them to be able to start again and this time, choose what they want. But as of now, my mom has terrible credit history, not to mention that she is about to let the house go and my brother's credit history is going to get destroyed in the process. He already knows this and is entirely supportive of it, because he knows she needs to do this and cannot make payments on this house while supporting everyone else. I hear her praying everynight and asking for this to be resolved. I do as well. I'm not going to get into a religious discussion but the only reason any sane member of my family is still here is because of hope, and even now I still hope that someone may be able to help.

If there's anything I left out that you want to know, I'll do my best to answer it. 

So please, to anyone still out there who may be able to offer some realistic advice, please tell me.

[deleted],1326531937,/r/AskReddit/comments/ogn4s/dear_reddit_my_cousin_was_wrongfully_reported_by/,"My cousin and her husband moved to the bay area from Bangalore, India 5 years ago. Both of them were born and brought up in India. He has a masters in computer engineering and she was a veterinary doctor in India. They have a beautiful 6 year old daughter. Her husband works in IT in the bay area and as of the past year she stays at home to take care of her daughter. This past christmas break her husband did not allow her or her child to come visit our family for our usual christmas get together. 

My cousin's parents (grand parents of the child) had been staying with them and when they said they were planning on driving down to visit our family anyways he refused to allow them to use any of the cars. They ended up renting a car and staying with the rest of our family in central california until early dec 24th morning. While they were with us my uncle expressed his concerns about his son in laws erratic behavior. He would often ask him to invest in what my uncle saw as a plain out pyramid scheme. My uncle repeatedly refused to invest is the schemes and he would get very angry with him. My uncle and aunt drove back on the 24th since they didn't want my cousin and their grand daughter to be alone on christmas day as he did not permit going to any of the parties they were invited to there.
My uncle and aunt left to visit India 2 weeks ago and so it has been cousin, her husband and daughter alone again. 

The following events lead up to the arrest of my cousin:
My uncle called my dad up, from India concerned about the fact that my cousin's husband had taken her to a psychiatrist this past Thursday and gotten her a 'diagnosis' of schizophrenia. She was given a prescription by the psychiatrist (who we have now found out is apparently a friend of her husband's), who told her to take the medication that evening. My cousin is unfortunately a very naive person. When she recounted to her sister, later that evening, that the psychiatrist had said ""You should have been a more diplomatic person in your marriage otherwise you wouldn't have gotten yourself here would you? In a psychiatric office"". She didn't seem to realize there was anything off about the Dr. saying that to her until her sister pointed it out. 

My uncle got in touch with my dad who is an Internal Medicine Dr and explained the situation. My dad reviewed the diagnosis with her while her husband was at work. He basically found it to be complete horseshit and the medication prescribed (i will find out the details asap) as absolutely unwarranted. He made sure to consult with three psychiatrists at the hospital he works at and to over the treatment plan that was given to my cousin. They all unanimously said that it was absolutely unnecessary for her to be on such strong medication after a first time visit. Basically something that would knock her out for a good 16 hours after she took it. 

Upon calling my cousin back with this information my Dad found himself admist an argument between my cousin and her husband. She had hid the medications because she felt uncomfortable taking them (since she had an idea of what they would do to her) and her husband was furious and was yelling at her to find them and to take them. My dad spoke to her husband, to both of them and said trying to calm them down and told them he would drive up to the bay area first this Friday morning and they would all sit and talk. He also told them that he would get my cousin an appointment a well qualified UCSF psychiatrist he is familiar with so that they could have another evaluation done. My dad ensured them he would help figure this all out and had talked them down until they seemed to be calm. He also said that and absolutely under no circumstances should my cousin take those pills. My cousin's husband was very disgruntled with my dad at the end of the conversation. 

My cousin called her sister a little bit after this conversation and recounted to her that her husband stepped out of the apartment and she overhead him speaking to on the phone to someone she didn't know on the phone. Apparently he said ""Looks like our plan is going to fail now, she's got her uncle driving up here tomorrow morning"".

 Friday morning her husband dropped her daughter off at school but 2 hours late. He then called up the police and claimed that his wife physically abuses their daughter and that she is cruel to her. Child protective services was called into her daughter's school and questioned her about if her mom hits her etc etc. She answered yes to a questions such as ""does your mom hit you"". Her husband gave a colorful police report about my cousin being mentally unstable and a diagnosed schizophrenic hence he wanted a restraining order. He then with his daughter in his car directed the police to his apartment where my cousin was alone at home. When she answered the door he was there with the police to positively identify her as his wife. She was taken too the station and was very confused about what was going on. He husband didn't say a word to her as they took her away he got in his car with his daughter and that is the last anyone has heard from him. My cousin was arrested and was to be held until tuesday at which point she would be admitted into a psychiatric inpatient clinic for evaluation. 

When she questioned on her husband about if he was a good father etc she replied yes and spoke of him only in a positive light. She was still confused that he was actually pressing charged against her. She thought that maybe a neighbor had mistakenly heard them yelling or something and her husband was actually somewhere in the station trying to explain things/get her out. She was also given a 2 month restraining order from seeing her child on the ground of her being mentally unstable as per evidenced in the psychiatric evaluation she had received the day before. She called up my parents and they drove up to the bay area this afternoon and bailed her out. In the meantime her husband has not picked up any phone calls from his relatives or her relatives or friends. The neighbors have been periodically checking their apartment to see if anyone is home and so far they had reported that the lights have remained off. And no one seems to be home.

My mom is a pediatrician and is quite familiar with child/physical abuse cases. She often visits my cousin and her daughter over the weekend and while she is no expert or a social worker she seems to be convinced that she has not seen any signs of physical abuse or indications. My mom seems to think that the few hours that my niece turned up late for school her dad may have been having her rehearse what she should say to social workers. I've grown up with my cousin and find it extremely shocking that someone would accuse her of that. Our entire family is in shock and were still trying to gather up all the information to get a full picture.

My uncle tells us that, while they stayed with them, my cousins husband would often provoke her into an argument and when she became heated enough to yell back he would record it on his phone. When asked why he was doing it he would lie or evade the question.

It seems to us that at the bottom of all of this is an unhappy marriage that her husband was possibly trying to get out of and have sole custody of his daughter. A year and a half ago my cousin enrolled in a graduate veterinary course in Louisiana that allowed her to complete a certain number of credits and give her experience to practice as a licensed vet in the US. She lived in Louisiana for 8 months, during which she visited the bay area only 2 times as her husband had said to much flying back and forth would be expensive. It is now seeming very likely possible that during this time period her husband may have met someone. It seems to my family that a lot of her husbands actions have been premeditated so as to gain sole custody of their child upon separation.

There is also a concern that he may have had money problems while being tied up in the pyramid schemes he was asking people to invest in as I had mentioned above. The other factor is that divorce is extremely taboo in the south asian community still and someone must take the blame when it happens. In this case we feel that my cousin being harmful to her child was the case her husband wanted to build for a separation. In addition they have both in the midst of the process of getting a green card and my family seems to think that having her arresting may lead to deportation when they review her for any criminal record.

At this point what can we do at this point to ensure that her daughter is safe? Since my cousin cannot see her due to the restraining order and no one has been in contact with the husband we are worried that we will not see her again. The husband has not even answered his own parent's phone calls. Can she go to the court and try and fight this? What are the most important things she should do at this point. We are also very worried that it is very hard for my cousin to disprove a lot of the accusations that her husband has made as she has no evidence to back her up. Any social workers, attorneys, people who are familiar with custody issues please offer me any advice and guidance in this situation.
Sorry for all the grammatical errors or punctuation issues I'm just writing everything in a hurry. I will update with more information as soon as I receive it. And thank you for reading through all this up there for all those who managed to!

**TL;DR- My cousin's husband seems to have completely screwed her over got her diagnosed as a schizophrenic by a questionable doctor as a way to get sole custody of their child. He had her arrested for child abuse and as she was in jail trying to figure it out he has now disappeared with their 6 year old and no one has heard from them.**

Edit 1: I added paragraph breaks I didn't notice the formatting first pass! Sorry about that! Punctuation and grammar fixes.

Edit 2: My cousin's sister called the cops to report that no one has heard from the husband since and they are concerned for the welfare of their niece. The cops said that since he is the biological father there is nothing they can do but they offered to go check the apartment and no one was home they arrived and they said if no one hears word to call back  again tomorrow.
  My cousin is also now bailed out of jail. She told me Psychiatrist she was scheduled to see did not actually see her and another lady introduced herself as ""not the doctor who usual works there but came in just for this case since your husband requested"". She didn't state her qualifications and the prescription she was given was written on the pad of the original doctor who was supposed to consult her. Her husband was very insistant on seeing just this doctor and no one else.

Edit 3: There is a psychiatric nurse that my cousin's husband supposedly kept company with. She was known to my cousin as one of his close friends (looking like possibly more than that) and she set up the appt with the psyc doctor.

Edit 4: I read the statement given by her daughter that supposedly qualified for abuse it read ""My mom slapped my hand with a spatula 5 times because I misbehaved""...when asked if it hurts my niece replied ""Sometimes it does""...When asked has she done it before her reply was ""once before in November"". I feel like they should have sent someone home to to interview my cousin as well?? This was done at her daughters school. In addition when the police arrested her they said it was due to her ""mental illness"" to which she replied I'm fine. And they said they have information from her husband that she had seen a psychiatrist and questioned her - did she go out of her own will. And her reply was ""He said if i didn't he wouldn't give me a second child and or a house to live in anymore"". 

Edit 5: My parent's got a call from my cousin on Friday afternoon around 4pm saying she was in jail and they wanted to keep here there until Tuesday. She had also called her husband as well and he said there was nothing he could do to bail her out she had to wait until Tuesday. He apparently told her he was ""working with an attorney"" to get bail. My dad called up the station and asked about bail and was she not allowed to be released, to which he was told thats absolutely not true. He asked when can we get my cousin out, they replied as soon as you fill out the paperwork and pay $500 dollars of the $5000 bail. At approx 7pm my dad received an email from her husband stating the same bold faced lie that he was still trying to ""get bail set with an attorney"" but unfortunately cannot get my cousin out. When he sent this email my dad had finished all already the paperwork and was waiting for her to be released. During this whole time period he had not picked up his phone just sent out one email. He has yet to answer any phone calls from any family or friends.

125098124,1620069384,/r/college/comments/n44p8n/trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/,"Hello folks, sorry for the incoming essay.

Right now I'm a junior working towards a B. A. in History with a minor in Music. Yes, I know, useless major. The full story was that I also had a major in Education, I was going to become a history teacher. Then Covid-19 hit and I lost a required student teaching opportunity because ""essential personnel only"" at schools. This student teaching was required to complete the education program, so for now I've dropped it. This does however leave me in a bit of a hole, since now my upcoming degree is gunna be useless with pretty much no real job prospects, and I don't really have the time to switch in a more useful major or minor.

My father's cancer relapsed recently, it's the third time. Externally, he looks in a lot worse condition than the first two times, and I'm legitimately afraid he won't be around much longer. A bit of a problem since between his job and the family savings (which are nearly dried up now), he's basically bankrolling 3/4 of college for me. I work 25+ hours a week after classes in fast food to help pay for a tiny bit, and I've taken some federal loans for the remainder. Partially because I was an absolute idiot who didn't plan ahead sufficiently for this sort of situation, partially because of a recent rapid grade slump, and partially because I spend so much time outside of school working instead of studying, my GPA is just barely above a 3.0 - so while I'm not in danger of getting kicked out, and I could still apply to some lower-tier graduate programs, I probably can't expect any scholarships or grants to help out.

My greatest fear at this point is that I'm going to graduate and not be able to find a half decent job, and get stuck working fast food for the rest of my life (which doing the math I can just barely manage, I'll just have to kiss any dreams of returning to school or ever having a family goodbye). I know that in order to actually have a chance higher than 0.001% of getting a half decent job, I'm going to need to go back to school. But with family savings literally almost emptied out (we have just barely enough for me to complete senior year), and my father literally breaking down, I don't know if we can do it financially. Plus, just looking at my father barely able to drag himself out of bed every day, coughing and barely able to stand, hurts my heart. As soon as I graduate and I'm no longer a burden on him, I legitimately want him to just take whatever money we've got left in the bank, and just go retire and enjoy life. He's earned it, unlike me. He's got a long list of things he's always wanted to do and places to visit, and he hasn't traveled for a vacation in almost 20 years. 

At the same time, the more I keep going to school, the more I hate it. I know I should count my blessings, being able to attend a fairly highly ranked school with enough savings available to pay through without having to take any loans except federal loans, but as I keep going I find it harder and harder to focus nowadays. Just one year ago I would spend all of my spare time just poring over historical texts and reading as much as I could, history was the one subject that I found joy reading and talking about; I legitimately could spend hours just talking about history. But over the last few months that's all changed. I barely motivate myself to get through the readings required for the next class. My grades are just slipping, and the more time I spend trying to study and work on papers and such, the more frustrated I feel when my grades keep going down. I'm kind of just forcing myself through the hoops at this point. I keep thinking about how my history degree is literally going to be useless in the job market, and that I've spent the last three years doing feck all without any actual result. I can't bear to read any of the stuff I used to. Just last week I took my small collection of history-related books and just dumped it all in the recycling bin. Inside, I've begun to feel resentment against my interest of history; or maybe, I just hate myself in general.

When I was in high school, I had a friend who actually still lives down the street from where I do. He was your classic future ""going places"" kid - really good at music (got into Nationals so you know he's good), tons of connections, a near-perfect high school GPA filled with APs and honors, tons of extra academic awards. He was literally the one kid everyone said was going to be a future lawyer - he was going to make it in life, he would just breeze right through and everything was going to be great. He even got accepted to Harvard. Then in the last two months or so of high school he just suddenly stopped showing up to school. He never ended up going back to school again, never attended graduation, I'm not sure if he even got his high school diploma. He spends his entire day either cooped up in his house staring at the walls of his room, or walking around outside alone for hours. From what I've heard, he doesn't really talk to anyone anymore except his parents, turned down his offer from Harvard, doesn't have anything he does in life (he doesn't even have a job), and pretty much nowadays all he does is exist. I'm scared that I'm turning into him as well, except a lot more slowly. I can barely force myself to go to classes I used to be passionate about, I have no interest in the things I used to enjoy, I no longer really have any goals in my life. Above all, recently I myself have started going for ""short walks"". I tell myself that I'm just going to take half an hour to clear my mind, and a moment later it's been four hours and I've just wasted all of my spare time with no memory of what happened. I legitimately think I'm burning out, and I'm afraid of turning into my neighbor - all promise and potential, but he burnt out of high school and nowadays he's just a ghost that just sort of exists.

Now of course this isn't the place to talk about finding a job; I've already made posts about that elsewhere, so there's that. But I am trying to weigh out my options. When I was 17 and just about to jump into college, I wrote out a path that I wanted to take based on my interests, but didn't think too hard about the other possible paths, or about a backup plan. This time, I'm going to spend some time assessing every single one of my options before I go anywhere, and I'm going to make sure I've crafted at least some sort of backup plan.

After some thought, reflection, and research, here's what I've come up with in terms of options.

Problem 1: Graduate early to save money (useful for future financial emergencies, or early funding for a future return to school if that happens)? Now that I've dropped the education dual major, I'm actually on track to finish almost all of my graduation requirements for my History major and general education. My music minor is already complete, and doing the math it's possible for me to finish up the last requirements and graduate next semester, which would be one semester early and save me 30k (which mathematically I've calculated would be enough for me to barely survive for one year where I live).

1. Graduate early, take the money saved, and roll with it. The pros are that I get to save enough money to survive a year, and I only have to worry about burnout for one more semester, instead of two. The cons are of course I'll have one less semester to fill up with classes to attempt to pad my GPA, so my final GPA will probably be lower than it could be, hurting my chances of getting into a half decent graduate program in the future, or returning for another undergrad degree.
2. Don't graduate early, spend the final semester just padding my GPA with random classes. The pros are that obviously I get to mentally put off the future for another semester, graduate alongside my few friends, maybe get some final happy memories before I face reality, and of course, I get one final semester to attempt to pad my GPA with easier classes which might help if I go for graduate school. But on the flip side, I would need to keep potential burnout at bay for one more semester, and I'd end up with less money and a tiny bit more debt. Also if I screw up and keep burning out, I'll end up with a worse GPA.
3. Put off graduation and basically redo college to get an actually useful degree. This is technically an option, but considering the family's financial concerns and my father's health, as well as my feelings of burnout, this would be incredibly risky. The pro is that I obviously get a more useful degree with actual market value. The downside is that with the finances in such dire shape I'd basically have to bankroll the entire education with private loans, which might end up killing me even more afterwards. Plus, I'm already burning out now, and completely collapsing and turning into my neighbor two years down the line with all these private loans out would literally not only end my life, but also everyone else in my family, with no result. Still, if all my other options are sufficiently stupid ideas, I'm willing to give this a shot; it'll just be a huge gamble with the odds against me.

Problem 2: Go for further education immediately? My GPA as-is won't be good enough for medical school or law school. I have absolutely no interest or knowledge in medicine anyway, so forcing myself through that might just burn me out even more anyway. It's still good enough for some programs at schools with lower rankings, although my grade slump in the last year or so is going to impact how admissions looks at my GPA. Plus, immediately jumping back into school is going to kill me financially, not as much as delaying graduation since I might qualify for more federal funding if I do a master's, but still, I probably won't qualify for scholarships or grants and the family savings are nearly dry. On the other hand, at least I get to dodge reality for a few more years, and I might come out with a more useful degree.

1. Get a Master's in Education, which would be the plan that most closely follows my original dream. With a state school it wouldn't cost too much, so theoretically if my father was alright with it we could make it work without taking too much in loans. Downside is, in my state, we have too many qualified history teachers for open positions, so if I can't somehow beat out the most recent 1:900 ratio that's been reported, I'm going to be back where I am already, but with more debt. Plus, potential burnout.
2. Get a Master's in some historical subject. Unlikely and not a good idea since I'll just get an equally worthless Master's degree, plus burnout potential.
3. Get a Master's in some other subject. It's a possibility, but it will cost a lot of money. Plus burnout potential. Plus my GPA is already too garbage for most of these programs anyway.
4. Apply to a lower-ranked school and go back as an undergrad. I can pray that they'll give me some financial assistance, and theoretically the classes shouldn't grade as harshly maybe. That being said getting a degree from a no-name school might not help very much. Plus burnout potential of course.
5. Do an associate's in some sort of trade. Most of these seem to be in healthcare though, which I have absolutely no interest in, so I might just end up burning out of those too. They do tend to be a lot cheaper, so I might be able to work it financially. In the very worst case, I could just attempt to do some associate's in business administration and just go be a low-paid office clerk. I'd hate the job but it would pay a hell of a lot more than fast food, have mostly reasonable hours, etc.
6. Yolo into an apprenticeship or trade school. Good future potential and an apprenticeship gets me pay. Downside is that I have a leg problem; I can still walk and do some manual labor tasks, I just don't know if I can keep doing it 10 years down the line. Still, man's gotta earn money.
7. Don't go back to school immediately. On the plus side, it gives me a lot of time to reflect and actually figure out what the hell I want to do, and might help with the burnout. In the meantime, I will need to find a job though. If it pays enough, I might be able to save up enough to go back to school. But if all I can get is some minimum wage fast food job, I guess I'll just kiss my future goodbye. Especially since I probably can't expect my parents to pay for my education 5 years down the line.

Desperate4Advice,1296905299,/r/AskReddit/comments/ffqza/im_desperate_i_could_use_some_advice/,"Reddit, I am in desperate need of advice.  First, however, I need to tell you my story and explain my situation.  I apologize in advance for it will be long but necessary.  I will also warn that this story will be a bit complicated to keep organized as there are several different parts I’ll have to jump back and forth in attempts to give all the details.  Forgive me if it becomes difficult to follow.

I am originally from Florida and my wife was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Pennsylvania.  My wife’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1999 leaving her in Pennsylvania.  She eventually ran out of money and she had succumbed to dire situation of being without immediate family and having no money to support herself.  She followed her family to Florida and I eventually met her through her brother.  After being together for about seven years and living together for about four years, my wife and I decided to get married.  This was some of the greatest times of my life.  The year following our wedding was fantastic.  We honeymooned in the Bahamas, we camped out in Key West, and we took a two week vacation in Yellowstone National Park.  Unfortunately, it was this year that also lead to the precursor of the desperate situation I am in now.

In November or December of 2006, I had begun to notice a pain in my right abdomen.  It wasn’t anything severe, it was just noticeable.  At the time, I had great insurance so I went to the doctor to make sure it wasn’t anything severe or serious.  The doctor seemed unconcerned about it being severe but had asked me if I wanted pain medication.  I declined as it wasn’t anything I couldn’t deal with and I was a person who refused to take medication for anything.  I would suffer through headaches because I was so stubborn concerning medication.  In the meantime, the doctor had sent me to several “specialists” and had several tests done on me.  I had C.A.T. scans, Ultra Sounds, full blood work (13 vials worth of blood), and I had gone to see a surgeon and a gastrologist.  Nobody could figure out what the pain in my abdomen was.  

About a month later, I began vomiting profusely.  For fear it was appendicitis (abdominal pain and vomiting are usually indicators), my wife took me to the E.R.  It was later revealed that the vomiting was from the Flu.  The E.R. performed several C.A.T. scans of their own concerning the abdominal pain but still, they found nothing.  What they did find out, however, is that I was diabetic.  I had suspected that I was diabetic for a while.  It was revealed that I had been diabetic since I was 20 years of age.  I’m not an obese person by any means, but my entire family on both sides are diabetic: all four of my grandparents, my father, my mother, and several blood aunts and uncles.  I was convinced that my abdominal pain had something to do with my diabetes.  So far, no connection has been made.

At some point around that same time, my wife and I had decided that we were going to move from Florida up to Maryland so that she could be closer to her family and we could have a scenery change.  We chose this particular time to move because I had just received my Associate’s Degree and my wife had just earned her Master’s Degree and we both decided that it would be a good time to transition.  We made the move up to Maryland in July of 2007.  I was attending two separate universities undergoing a dual-degree program and my wife had found a good job teaching at an elementary school.  That October, we bought a house (our first time).  Another reason that year was so fantastic.  Even though school was tough that semester (I had to leave my house before 6am to make a 2 hour drive to school before class started at 8am and I didn’t get home until after 9pm), it was very enjoyable.  Through the rest of that year, the abdominal pain slowly got more painful.

About halfway through the elementary school year, my wife decided to quit her job.  The reason my wife left her job is due to the fact that the school administration was telling her to give the children passing grades (unearned) and to not spend so much time actually teaching the children.  My wife was becoming physically stressed and physically ill due to this.  Unfortunately, the consequence of her quitting meant that her teaching license in Maryland was suspended and she couldn’t teach anywhere else in the state of Maryland.  A week later, we received the greatest and scariest news I have ever received; my wife was pregnant with our first child.  I was ecstatic but frightened that neither of us had a job to pay the mortgage of the house we just bought.  My wife found an inventory business to work for.  She eventually had to leave that job as well as they were only giving the employees 15 minute breaks during 10 hour shifts.  They got around giving them more breaks because they would only schedule everyone to work for 4 hours and it would just happen to take longer.  

All of this was happening at the beginning of 2008, which was the beginning of the recession.  The area of Maryland in which we lived was extremely rural.  If we wanted milk, it was a 45 minute drive.  Work was nowhere to be found for either of us.  I was having trouble paying for books and tuition due to out-of-state tuition.  I had failed to realize that Maryland does financial aid differently than Florida does.  In Florida, you pay for your classes with a student loan and if you withdraw from that class after the add/drop date, the class is still paid for and you just end up paying back the student loan for that class you didn’t receive a grade for.  I thought Maryland was the same procedures.  Well, apparently not.  In Maryland, when you withdraw from a class paid for by a student loan after the add/drop date, the student loan lenders actually unpay the school.  Needless to say, I currently owe the university $5000 so I have been unable to attend school since 2008.  Until I pay the $5000, the university will not release my transcripts and no other university will take me without my transcripts.  We’ve been severely broke since 2008 and I doubt I’ll ever be able to get back in school.  

With foreclosure of our house immanent, my wife and I took a trip back down to Florida to scout out some potential employment.  We had planned to stay with my mother and father for a few weeks to attempt to find employment and housing, go back up to Maryland to pack our stuff, tie up any loose strings, and say our goodbyes.  A week after we were back in Florida, my (pregnant) wife had noticed she had some slight bleeding coming from her vagina.  We had been having sex so we figured this was the cause.  My wife had decided to not take the chance and I took her to the E.R.  The nurses said that it was probably just from us having sex.  However, upon further investigation, they discovered that my wife was dilating.  The baby wasn’t due until October 6, 2008.  It was June 13, 2008.  At this point, we didn’t even know whether we were having a boy or a girl.  The doctors had performed several tasks in order to keep her from going into labor.  These efforts were in vein as the following Tuesday, June 17, 2008, my son was born at 3:18am.  My son was born during the 14th week of the gestational period (3.5 months early).  My son was 1lb, 11 ounces and he fit in the palm of my hand.  He couldn’t breath without a ventilator and needed constant care.  My son spent the next 3 months in the N.I.C.U.  During that time, our SUV had been repossessed.  

After my wife recovered, she found a job teaching at a community college.  We moved out of my parents’ house and into a duplex.  It was several months later we had to leave as my wife’s classes got cut.  We moved in with my wife’s sister and her significant other.  That was disastrous and we ended up moving back in with my parents who had since moved to a double-wide trailer.  This was a horrible situation.  My mother is a severe hoarder.  We were confined to one bedroom and the living room, which was almost completely filled up with her “craft stuff”.  My son was just beginning to crawl and he would go through these boxes and find knives, razors, scissors, and other stuff that shouldn’t be in the reach of a baby.  Cooking was impossible as the counters were covered.  It would take us almost a year to get out of that place.  

My wife had received a second job with a second local community college.  She was making enough money to support us while I could stay home with our son.  I only have my Associate’s Degree with only a little bit of experience in retail and fast food.  Not only were none of these places hiring, but none of these places would pay enough for me to justify working these jobs and put my son in daycare.  I had one job offer but I would be making less than what I would be paying the darecare.

All the while this stuff is happening, the pain in my abdomen is getting very, very severe.  There are days I can’t get out of bed it’s so severe.  I go to several more doctors.  At this time, I have no insurance so every doctor’s visit is money we don’t have.  They do nothing but send me to “specialists” who want an arm and a leg.  I go through more C.A.T. scans, more Ultra Sounds, more blood work, a HIDA scan, and even a colonoscopy.  Nothing.  It’s has gotten to the point that I ask the doctors if they can give me something for the pain until they can figure out what it is.  This sends off red flags to them and I instantly become someone who (in their eyes) in begging for drugs.  This is not the case at all.  I just want to be able to function.

Recently, we lost over half of our income.  We’ve applied for Food Stamps but it’s taking them over 30 days to approve or decline us even though we were told we would receive a 7 day expedite.  Even with the Food Stamps, we currently cannot afford rent.  The internet will soon be turned off as we cannot afford to pay for it.  I have been looking for employment but we only posses one vehicle.  We have a 2.5 year old as well.  My wife works over an hour away so I have to be able to find work that will be opposite to when my wife works.  The other problem is how severe and frequent my abdominal pain has become.  There are days I cannot get out of bed.  How am I suppose to keep a job with uncertainly like that?  I have a friend that has chronic sciatica and consequently has a prescription for Vicadin.  He gives me some here and there but  I feel terrible for taking it as I know he needs it himself.

The abdominal pain has severely diminished my quality of life.  I use to be someone who never stayed home.  I was always out doing something.  Now, I currently never leave the house.  It’s put a severe strain on my marriage.  She understands that I am in pain but my inability to get up some days puts more work on her plate.  I understand why she’s angry about it.  I don’t blame her.

I don’t know what to do anymore.  I need to find a job to keep from becoming homeless.  I need to get rid of this abdominal pain so I can stop being useless.  I don’t want my son growing up seeing me this way.  I so much just want to be a productive member of society and be a good father.  I want to have energy to do things again.  I want my son to be proud of me; I want him to look at me someday and say “that’s my dad” and to be proud when he says that.  I want to return to being someone who is out doing recreational things instead of sitting at home day in and day out.  I don’t want to be physically unable to get out of bed until 3 in the afternoon.

I don’t know what I am expecting anyone to say.  I don’t know what I am expecting at all.  I’m desperate.  I don’t know what to do.  I feel useless (because I am at this point).  It kills me to be unable to provide for my family.  It kills me that I am unable to do the simplest of tasks.  Standing up and walking can sometimes be unbearable. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  Thank you in advance for any and all advice.

TL;DR - I can't go to school because I owe $5000, myself and my wife lost over half our income, can't pay rent, and I have a severe abdominal pain that is debilitating to the point that I can't even get out of bed on some days.  It's become more severe and more frequent with time.

xxsilverrainexx,1310281386,/r/AskReddit/comments/ilgm3/is_it_right_for_me_to_quit_my_new_job/,"First and foremost I apologize for the wall of text that follows but I feel I should try to be as detailed as possible because well my life has been really bumpy.

I've honestly had a lot of stress issues with jobs in general in the past due to a lot of deep rooted issues that I'll get into as much as I can. 

Basic family:
My work ethic is essentially garbage, I grew up in a home where my dad worked 12 hour shifts to stay away from my mom (guardians not real parents I was given away at birth) who had never worked a day in her life. Currently I live with my mom who years after they divorced has worked at a grocery store. Growing up I had a lot of social issues, I dropped out of school at 14 because I couldn't handle the stress and being picked on nonstop growing up thus leading to a huge lack of self confidence. 

During this time starting when I was 11 years old I was taken advantage sexually by an uncle (I'm a male btw), which continued until I was 16+ however by 16 I had the courage to stand up to him and tell him I wasn't interested. However by this time my parents may has well have forgotten I existed and this was exploited.. My uncle worked out an arrangement that I needed to continue my ""Work"" with him for 100$ an hour every 2 weeks which I regretfully took because at the time I had no other source of food, clothing or happiness.. edit: this arrangement ended when I was 18 and I was blamed for being an emotional fuck up for him because he couldn't depend on me.

Work Experience:
I've worked at a lot of jobs and well very few have gone well, I started working in various fast food chains where I could barely last a week.. I couldn't stand the repetition and stress of possibly making a mistake and getting yelled at for being at fault. I would call out a lot and generally had a slow pace and didn't do my job well emotionally these jobs made me feel like crap. 

When I was 21 I got a job at Best Buy doing computer sales (was supposed to be hired for geek squad), I'm extremely tech savvy and computers have always been my thing. That ended poorly after being told I had no chance for advancement for over 6 months and I wasn't doing my job well enough for them. This is due to the fact that I was more than 5 minutes late 5 or 6 times during holiday hours where I was scheduled off my availability (3 write-ups in 1 week all in the same day); but to my own defense they knew I was living in a house that was considered an arcade and it was hard for me to get up for shifts earlier than 11am (there was a drummania machine above my bed that was on until 4am). 

I'd found an ad on craigslist for an arcade repair tech, and as previously stated I was living in an arcade at the time. I had a few friends who had collectively purchased machines and it became a hobby of mine to work on them regularly so naturally I got the job at a local skating rink fixing all their arcade machines. This job paid extremely well (15$ an hour) and I got good hours, it was plenty for me to pay all of my bills and I was set. I was extremely happy working at the job, I essentially made my own hours and took care of business as it needed to get done, I was challenged physically and mentally and always learning new things. [8 Months later] However the home owner I lived with ended up getting a boyfriend and our adjusted rent followed by giving a note saying we had to move out in 2 months. 

Thankfully I actually managed to get a side job with [Adult Swim] a few months prior building a few arcade machines for a festival. So I should have had enough spending money to cope, but of course this was not the case due to some hardware failure and transportation issues.  

I had nowhere to go and ended up selling a few arcade machines I'd been able to purchase / acquire through work, taking the money and moving 1/2 way across the country into a house with 4 of my WoW guildies. I had a lot of trouble finding a job, on top of a lot of culture shock and drama things didn't work out.. My dad was nice enough to bail me and give me enough money to get home after I exhausted all of my funds. 

Today:
9 Months later of being unable to find work I'm living with my mom, who after her divorce ended up not receiving alimony from my dad for almost 2 years. She'd lived off and exhausted all of her 401k and savings (which wasn't anything to begin with ) and had to move into a new apartment. She ended up taking a lot of high risk high interest loans to try to get by and our bills went into collections; as well as making a deal with my dad for him to pay up past due alimony to never have to pay her again. At this point we've again exhausted everything, and aren't making enough to get by, we've received emergency assistance to help pay 3 months of back rent and my dad has helped catch up on 2 months ahead, but after August there is no possible way for us to afford the rent and bills once again. (My mom is waiting on hopefully getting state housing assistance)

Due to being unemployed for 9 months my old college loans are deferred, my car payments are extremely behind, I have phone and credit card bills in collections, and I'm being sued by my college for financial aid they pulled on me. 

The job:

I'm currently working at a company called Staples (not sure if its only a New England chain) at a department called Easy Tech. Its essentially geek squad but without the training, I was hired as a Master Tech to do in-home installs and tech work. Currently I've worked for them for over 5 weeks, I've called in 3 times now due to the way I'm treated and generally feel about the job. I've received little training (it took them 4 weeks to train me to use the register) and was pushed off to the side for most of my beginning weeks which prompted me to talk to corporate (My manager was giving me an attitude because I didn't know how to do anything besides stock things and I was scheduled to work on the tech bench. I was also told that we only get hours if we're performing well and my hours got shafted to 1 day a week). 

Now I've worked by myself at the tech bench 3 times, I have no idea what I'm doing because their paperwork trails are confusing and nobody really shows me what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel extremely uncomfortable and stressed even thinking about the job, and the quality of work we do makes me feel morally wrong because of how much we take advantage of people. We had a situation where a customer was told they had to purchase new ram, they failed to explain that its because our tech fried it by mishandling it. We use a scanner program called PC Doctor and 90% of computers fail the hard drive tests due to bad or unreadable sectors (most harddrives have some bad sectors or issues they just end up being ignored by the OS and aren't an issue, and this particular computer passed the test a few times before failing it) and I had to tell a 60 year old woman her computer was unusable because of a few bad sectors and she had to purchase a $50 harddrive + $50 install + $120 Windows install and if she wanted any of her data backed up it would be $240 since the harddrive had issues and it would be an emergency recovery when there was nothing and she had brought it in for a ""Free Tune up"". 

I typically pride myself on my computer knowledge and I have plenty of experience in a lot of fields. I'm proficient with all hardware and software platforms, and I'm familiar with Photoshop, After Effects, and Maya. I spend most of my free time studying and learning new things but lack the confidence to really put anything I learn into motion. 

At this point the job I'm working is dragging me down emotionally, I'm starting to have panic attacks and I honestly don't feel like I have what it takes to blatantly rip people off for services that aren't performed and deal with a company who's left me pretty much in the dust because I'm too slow at learning. The thought of going into work is physically making me ill and I honestly do not want to deal with this anymore. The embarrassment of wasting their time and quitting on the spot make me feel even more useless and more like I'm fucking up and I'd like a job that I feel like I'm actually accomplishing something or at least something that challenges me like the arcade did.

As far as reasons to keep the job:
I have a car insurance bill, car payment, monthly payment for a lawyer to prevent being sued, monthly payment for credit card overdue, etc etc. Rent I can't afford. There is a cute girl who works the register who smiles at me a lot (but I have enough girl drama)

Why I want to leave:
At this job I'm making minimum wage, my checks have been ranging from 40$ to 150 (on an extremely good week with time and a half), no commission and I won't be receiving more hours. The job is entirely dependent on me having a car however I can barely afford the car payment, I had to take a high risk loan in order to get my car insured but I was unable to pay the past due $600 to my other car insurance company. Once that bill hits collections my car insurance is once again cancelled, which cancels the policy on my car payment putting my car back up for repossession. I'm stressing out and making myself sick I have no idea what to do and regardless of what I do in a few months I'm bound to be homeless or in a worse situation anyways, we've been living off luck lately. My girlfriend of 6 years has been helping as much as she can with my bills but I feel at this point its a lost cause I'm essentially a leech, I really want to file for bankruptcy because I know there is no way I can catch up. 

I've applied to other jobs and haven't had much luck, and to be honest I don't feel like I can just take anything because of my stress issues in general. I'm extremely introverted and have a lot of trouble dealing with the public in general but it all really seems like a lost cause.. I'm so far behind and really don't care anymore.. 

One big issue is that I look back at the work that I do and compare them to others... I just recently did a 5 hour job that paid as much as a week of work with my normal job and I can't help but say to myself ""I used to make $100 an hour for sex"" or ""I made twice this much a few months ago for the same work"" or ""I'm better than this""

I have no friends or family who can help me, I've tried and my last visit with relatives ended up with a few ""good luck being homeless"" comments.

I'm a complete stress case, I have a lot of issues that I don't know how deal with, I don't have health insurance and don't really deal with doctors.. I've had nothing but bad experiences with psychologists, medications and treatment centers and the last thing I need is more bills to worry about.

I know reddit isn't full of doctors and I don't expect anyone to really be able to help.. But I figured its worth a shot to explain myself a bit and see if anyone has enough of a heart and enough knowledge to offer some advice. All I know is I don't want to go into work tomorrow, I'm going to be stuck cleaning up after an incompetant tech team's mess with no idea of how to do any of their paperwork and having to disappoint people I don't have the heart for it and I have enough on my plate.

Do you think quitting my job and getting the stress off my shoulders would be a positive step towards clearing my head and getting into a better situation? I'd really like to start my own tech business and I have a friend who's on the same page as me I just have no idea how to start. 

I'm sorry if the formatting is terrible as well its 3 am and I'm sure I'll edit this post a thousand times as I go over it. 

edit: holy shit this wall of text is a lot bigger than I thought it would be... I don't blame anyone for not responding...

Edit: TL;DR I have serious emotional and stress issues, no work ethic and I'm being paid no money to rip people off..

Myjobistaxing,1588423584,/r/college/comments/gc5vlx/tips_from_a_graduating_senior/,"Hope you can benefit from the experience I’m about to share. 

TL;DR
With two weeks until graduation, I have a few words of advice: 

I am not saying to abandon your art degree. I am saying to seriously consider your return on investment. How much will it cost? How much will you be making after going to school? How long will it take to pay off your loans? This goes for any degree. 

Another thing: take your total semester tuition and figure out the math to find out how much money you are spending per in-person class. Say your tuition is $12,000. You’re taking five classes. 12,000/5= $2,400 a class. Your class meets twice a week for 16 weeks, (32 times). Each in person class is $75 a class ($2,400/32). Take pride in your work. Don’t ditch. Try to learn something and pay attention. 

Unless dorming is an absolute necessity, as in driving more than 45 minutes-hour each way, don’t do it. I know way too many privileged people that needed the “college experience”, dormed despite living less than 30 minutes away, and have insane amounts of debt. They’re all moving back home. 

Consider going to the least expensive option you have. 

Another HUGE piece of advice, don’t go away to college to study anything that can be studied at your local, state university, even if the program is better. It would have been a foolish waste of money for me to study accounting at a private college. (Unless you get an insane scholarship)

Instead, if you get accepted into another specific program, such as a physics program, and the closest program is the one you’ve been accepted to, but it’s far, then dorm! The point is, living at school will cost roughly a minimum of $40,000. That is a substantial amount of money; quite literally a downpayment on a condo!!

In short, dorm if you live too far from a university or if your program/field of study is far away. (Not many state colleges offer aerospace engineering or something like that). When figuring out whether to dorm or not, consider your career prospects given your major of study- you must. 

Also, definitely consider community college!! People who do this route wind up with the same degree after transferring to a four year college!

I didn’t realize that even at a state school, while saving money on not dorming as a commuter, a local, state education is still one the largest financial decisions of your life. It’s easily $50,000-$60,000. I had little concept of this at 18. If you’re unsure of what you want to study, and you don’t have a scholarship contingent on you attending this fall, consider a gap year. I don’t want this to come off as privileged; instead, I want to illustrate the point that it’s much better to take time off than racking up $40k of debt before dropping out! However, rather than traveling, use the time to try to figure out just what it is you’re interested in. With these uncertain economic times and unprecedented amounts of student loan debt, we are in very similar economic positions as those in the Great Depression. 

Use Amazon to rent to textbooks. 

Use rate my professor- not to take the easy way out with easy professors, but instead to avoid exceptionally poor professors if possible.

You can still pursue your arts outside of your area of study. There’s no shame in being addicted to food, water, and shelter. Thus we’re tied to a capitalistic system. You are not a sellout if you decide to change your mind and venture from art. 

Work hard. Don’t sweat the small stuff though. 

For many entry-level jobs, it doesn’t matter what you study so long as you have a degree. 

Regardless of what you’re studying, don’t limit yourself to identifying with that given major. 

Beware of 5 year arts programs!! (5 year bachelor programs are most practical if they’re necessary for your degree, or if your bachelor degree has a high return on investment. 

Avoid drugs, alcohol, and caffeine. Don’t become dependent on them. 

College is entirely what you make of it. If you study hard, but go to a local school, you’ll thrive. 

I’m graduating with a 3.84 GPA with a Bachelor of Science and minor in economics. During college, the internship I had paid $17 an hour and I’ll be graduating with no debt. I have a position lined up for $62,000, and I plan on moving out soon. I would never have been able to do these things had I continued down my original path of music, which I highlight below. I also attribute my lack of debt to COMMUTING. As of now, I have the time to pursue my love for music outside of school, yet I received a much broader education, having taken many more gen eds than a typical music major! I’m not advocating that money=happiness, but sadly we need it. I’m advocating for those unsure of their degree, to be open to any possibility. 

YOUR COLLEGE MAJOR IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TO YOUR PASSION. 
Often times, you can study your passion outside of a more practical degree. You love English, but want better job security? Do English education! You love music but are fearful of job prospects? Become a musical scientist! You love history but don’t want to teach? Study history in your leisure and study something with a better career prospect. You become more well-rounded that way, too! Plus, you can combine a more practical degree with your passion!

The degree doesn’t make you talented- your hard work does. You can become a talented writer without studying it in college. Plus if you study what you’re familiar with, you might only get marginally better. For instance, where I’m at a musician versus where I’d be had I pursued it in college wouldn’t make a difference to an average listener!

You can define yourself as an artist or musician yet still study something like math, science, etc. It’s frustrating we don’t economically incentivize humanities or arts outside of academia, but it’s true. And I came to that realization, if you want to read my story!

Here’s some books I read in college
The Accounting Game- if you enjoy it, you’ll probably enjoy accounting. Be warned, though, long hours exist in this field depending on where you go post-college. 
The Little Book of Common Sense Investing
Where the Crawdads Sing
This is Your Brain on Music
The Cigarette Century
Walden
One More Thing
In The Shadow Of Man
Firefighting
100 Heartbeats
The Joy Of Living
Musicophilia

If you read throughout college, you can get yourself a Harvard education for the price of a book! Apply yourself. 

My story:
Four years ago, when I was a naïve high school senior, I had one goal: make it into a very competitive jazz program and get my undergraduate degree in Jazz Performance and Music Education. 

I was rejected, and I remember feeling shattered for not being “good enough” at my craft. 

During this time, I also felt pressure to attend college immediately upon graduating high school in the spring, because I had a substantial scholarship that was contingent upon me beginning my collegiate career in the fall of that same year. 

I wound up attending, going in declared as a Musical Studies major. It was during my first two months where I realized it just wasn’t for me. (I still remember sitting in a choir class with roughly 80 other students doing “lip trills”, and that’s where it “clicked” with me.) I was paying $75 a class for this!

Another huge disadvantage of a music degree were the 0 and 1 credit courses. Every semester you wind up taking 9-13 courses- many 0 and 1 credit courses. For me, taking 9 classes, (only 16 credits I think), was just too much for me to handle compared to the 4 at a time I was used to taking in high school. (We had a block schedule, set up very similar to college, with a fall and spring semester. We take 4 classes in the fall and 4 in the winter). I wouldn’t have minded putting in this extra work. But after college, job prospects are rather bleak for music majors. Why put in extra work for less return? (Unless you truly BREATHE it). 

One of the biggest disadvantages of a music degree is the lack of a well-rounded education. At least at my school, I think that some general education courses (gen eds) are waived in order for you to take music courses. I also know of some schools which require 5 years to get a bachelor’s in music education and performance. 

If I had one piece of advice for myself back then, it would be to not limit myself. I now believe that a person interested in a given subject can become passionate about another one that uses similar skillsets. Back then, I was more idealistic than practical, and it actually limited my thinking. 
Idealistic thinking: I can only be happy if I study music. Practical thinking: I can apply the same discipline and work ethic I put into music somewhere else, and still be happy.

For me, it was surprisingly accounting. The theoretical side of music has always interested me. Likewise, the theories and frameworks in accounting are similar to musical theory in the sense that they are quite logical. I’d even argue it uses that same analytical side of the brain found in the analysis of a musical piece. 

You may love music, but find yourself interested in other areas, too. After reading “This is your brain on music”, I thought it would be just as cool to study neuroscience!

I believe that the advice, “Do what you love”, is terrible. There are plenty of necessary jobs that people do not love, but are incredibly important for the function of our society. For example, garbagemen, mailmen, grocery store workers, and all front-line workers during this time are vital! We owe them a lot of gratitude; they are truly heroes during this crisis. I doubt they are loving what they are doing now though. 

Doing what you love may stem from privilege. Some people do not have the option to do what they love, which shouldn’t preclude you from doing what you love, but the recognition of this fact is important!

Additionally, I want to see everyone going into college, set up financially. On that note: 

In the past, now I could be wrong, but college was not only cheaper even when adjusted for inflation, but there was less competition. (There
were less people in the world, and we are now becoming highly educated and affluent.) An increasing number of people now have a college degree. It’s becoming the norm.

It astounds me that we expect 18 year olds to make major life decisions. When I was that age, my concept of money was very limited. After paying for the majority of my education through scholarship and work (~85-90%), I can assure you that it is a serious financial decision that requires a lot of planning. 

As a result, we must face the ultimate reality that our society does not place economic value or incentives to art, unless you are a pop music star. I know way too many talented musicians- far more talented than celebrities- that work multiple jobs in order to support themselves. Especially during these uncertain times, where only “essential” workers are working, please keep this fact in mind. Even in times of economic prosperity, there is typically only one music teacher per district, and even then, art programs are given a low priority compared to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, math). 

(I’m not saying I agree with this, it is just a sad fact that I had to realize. A hard pill I swallowed).

Sadly, college is not what it should be. Instead of cultivating a learning environment for the betterment of oneself, it is purely a business. (Perhaps it was always this way). 

It seems that they can exploit college students who are seeking an education in the arts and humanities. The colleges and universities know very well that these degrees have less than ideal job prospects, but charge the same amount for a degree that has better prospects. To me, this is evidence that these degrees are offered solely to capitalize on other idealistic college students like myself. 

I gigged in college and even wound up playing with musicians that made it into the jazz program. I wouldn’t have known from their playing. They were not substantially better or worse! It was reassuring. And it proves that your major should not define you. I also got the privilege to play with Jake Shimabukuro, my musical hero! And without a college degree!

If I was a father whose kid wanted to pursue music after high school, I would encourage his music career... But I’d dissuade him from majoring in music. If he wanted to pursue only music, I’d might even encourage him to not attend college at all. (After conducting an interview project with many touring musicians, I realized they came from a variety of backgrounds.) 

Of course some programs are necessary. If you want to be a teacher or a classical musician, you must get a college education. But keep in mind, especially during this pandemic, it will be very economically challenging, both in looking for a job and the career growth after attaining one. 

That being said, music has a huge role in my life. However, because of where I am financially having not studied music, I can come back to it, pursue it as a hobby, an enthusiast, and it’s always there for me. 

Any other college grads feel like this?

throwaway11146,1331676810,/r/AskReddit/comments/qv7cc/very_very_long_my_grandmother_had_a_terrible/,"This is a throwaway account, but I don't really care who recognizes this. My Grandmother fell right before Thanksgiving on a Friday, broke her hip, and lay on the floor in the kitchen until Monday night (I was going to check up on her on Tuesday when I go grocery shopping for her, but I decided I should head on over to see how she was doing). She was severely dehydrated, her pants showed that she soiled herself many times (and it dried), so I knew she was there for quite awhile. When I arrived, I found her there laying on the floor with soiled pants. I had no idea what happened, so I asked her ""Grandma what are you doing?"" She started talking, but none of it made sense at all. ""Come over here so I can see you better"" was one of the first things she said; she was looking at the counter laying on the floor. I panicked, called my mother because I wasn't exactly sure how bad it was (there was no blood at all anywhere) and she is a nurse, so I called her to see what she thought. Immediately called 911 right after. She had been laying on the floor for 3 days about, broke her hip, and was severely dehydrated.

**This is going to be really long, so skip down to the bold if you just want my issue now.** I'll give you a little background on my relationship with my Grandmother now that I think about it. When growing up, my biological father (Grandmother's son) wasn't there. At around age 2, he got arrested for breaking and entering and then drug charges. My mother would have none of that, so she left him. My grandfather and my grandmother were very proper elderly people, but they cared something fierce. My grandmother grew up in a small town, moved to St Louis and became a secretary for Anheuser Busch, did well for herself, had my uncle then my father with her first husband, but left him because he was abusive and an alcoholic. She remarried with my Grandfather John, who already had two grown children like she had two grown children. My Grandfather John admittedly I don't know a lot about. He was in the Korean war as an engineer, studied Geology and Civil engineering I believe, and was very well off. My grandmother was well off too after working for Anheuser Busch for many years. She took her bonuses in form of stock option with the company, and put much of her money into the company in stocks as well. She wasn't millionaire rich, but she was very well off. My grandfather being an engineer and very educated also saved up money throughout his life, and they took trips to Cancun or other places around the country. 

By the time I came into the picture, my father had been abusing drugs for about 3 or 4 years. My uncle was in a relationship with my aunt I believe, which she already had two children. I was entirely an accident, my mother was told she couldn't have children at an early age (late teens) so it was literally not even a thought. But I came and was born. Because of my father, my grandmother and grandfather wanted me to grow up right, so I spent most of my weekends, summers, and in general most of my time growing up from 3-12 over at their house in a nice neighborhood. My best friends for a long time were two twins who lived next door.

Well, my father got out of jail and worked with what he could throughout his life, doing concrete and construction mostly. But he still abused and used all his life. My grandmother spoiled me throughout life, taking me out to dinner with her and my grandfather, buying me my first and second bicycles, and even a electric jeep that the twins and I had, so we had 3; a mini-fleet. [here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/BhEQt.jpg)

I never had more than other kids, but most of what I had came from my grandmother. For my 16th Birthday she took me to a used car dealership to buy a car that I liked, I pointed out a car but told her I thought it might be too expensive, but she got it for me anyway.

I'd grown up knowing that she only considered me her grandson, even though I have two cousins through marriage to my aunt (one of which I'd consider closer than a brother). I also knew that she would get me almost anything if I begged for it, so I didn't. I did get a few things that I've used for years and years through asking, but never begging and trying to get more and more for no reason (I got a computer, and a droid).

My grandfather died and my father ran into more trouble with the law (lost his license, DUI, etc). My grandmother gave him her old car, then bought him a new one. She let him stay in her basement and when he stopped working, started helping him pay for child support for my half-brother (he had never paid a single cent to me, but I suppose my grandmother made up for it). I was doing my own thing, living at home and going to college, my father was at her house in the basement, not working and going out all the time. She gave him money to do so (she gave me an account at her credit union, joint account, and she deposited about $50-$75 if I ever needed money. I never told her I did, but she would call the bank every 2 weeks or so to see how much I had left), then he would ask for more and more. $20 for gas to get shopping right down the street, things like that. Then when she couldn't go grocery shopping anymore (I went ocassionally) due to shortness of breath, he went for her with a list. She gave him a check to do so with no amount specified, he would fill it in at the store.

One time, he went to a different location, same store, and they called her house. Apparently for months he added on $100 to the total amount and got that in cash. Now the reason he always had an excuse for the receipt not being there came to light. She got pneumonia in February of last year, I stayed over the night like I do occasionally, and heard her coughing then talking to someone on the phone. I go to see what the matter was; she was coughing up blood. I freaked out a little, told her we are going to the hospital. My father was painting her den at the time. As we get her coat and everything on to go, he says ""Hey ma, it's going to take two coats of paint for the den so I'm going to need another $100 to paint it"". As she was going to the hospital for coughing up blood. I almost beat him then and there, but I wanted to get her to the hospital. Long story short, when she was in the hospital, all of her jewelery was stolen from her own home. Someone took her jewelery box, took it to an appraiser or pawn shop, found what was real and what was just basically plastic or prop, then told the stuff of value. Guess what my father said about that? ""It must have been this girl I brought over, I didn't watch her for a little bit."" Yeah, she snuck out with an entire box of jewelery right under his nose.

He went to jail, eventually unable to dodge getting sent there for DUIs, DWI, possession and other things. This left my grandmother alone. I went down to Texas in the summer to stay with my cousin and his wife and visit, and was actually going to stay to go to school where they live (they just bought a house, both in the air force), but he was going to be deployed and staying in a house with just his wife and I wasn't something she would want, understandably. They married the year before and had only been in town to visit a few times, so we didn't know each other very well. So I went back home, a few months later my grandmother had her accident.

**Okay, here's where I need help.** Throughout the entire process of her going into the hospital and being there, I am the only family member who still lives in St. Louis. My uncle moved to California, my father is in jail, my cousin is in Texas, my great-uncle lives to the south about 90 miles. Everyone comes to visit during Thanksgiving, but other than a few random visits I'm the only one there for her. Not unwillingly, but pretty much forced regardless. She has heart problems, blood clots in her legs, major dehydration, and during her visit she developed major memory loss/confusion. She didn't know what was going on or where she was about a week into the hospital stay. Throughout this I visited not every day after the first week, but I visited at least every other day. Checked up, see how things went, talked to the nurses, called and informed everyone if anything changed (about 3 or 4 phone calls each time), and got pretty exhausted. From the way things looked, she could never be home alone again. And there was no one else to look after her besides me. Cut through about 3 months (Nov to the end of January), she finally finishes her inpatient physical therapy at a nursing place, and she can go home.

The past 3-4 weeks have been mentally and physically exhausting. She has bowel problems ([C. Diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile)), has to use a walker and hadn't developed enough strength to carry something in one hand, and has many medications she has to take that I have to keep track of and re-fill. First two weeks consisted of her calling my cellphone or calling out to get her a glass of water, milk, soda... or that she needed me to make her something and give it to her, or to help her get dressed. It was so often that one time I sat down to drink a soda and wake up, I couldn't get a single drink in over the course of 30 minutes of sitting down, then standing up because she needed something else.

Maybe I'm selfish. Maybe I need to suck it up, but I cannot maintain going to school, taking care of her, doing homework, and filling her wants every 5 minutes. Over the past week or two we've established that she can get herself sodas and water and milk. And she can get herself food if she is hungry. But, she has wants. It doesn't matter if I'm currently in the middle of something online involving school (i.e. timed exams), she wants her Arby's/Ice Cream Bar/Steak and Shake right now. I asked if I could order her a pizza so I didn't have to leave (in the middle of something involving class), and told me she ""doesn't want a fucking pizza"". Recently, I stopped over at a friends house after finding out that I'm on spring break (and arriving at class). I had told her I would be at class until 5pm and be home at 5:30, she had scheduled a beauty appointment at 5pm without talking to me first. She got a friend to take her, so I didn't rush home after finding out about spring break. I called at 6:30 to see how her beauty appointment went and make sure she was okay; she said it wasn't as good as she hoped, told her I stopped at my friends on my way back, and she wanted Arby's since I was on my way home. Okay, that's fine. I'll stop and pick it up since there's one on the way.

**Here's the really really stressful part.**
30 minutes later, I check my phone and see that I have a voicemail. It's her calling saying I neglect her, there's no food in the house, I don't care if she falls, I don't make sure she has her medicine, etc.

I don't have to tell you how absurd any of these claims are. She threatened to call her brother ""to see how she was living"". I told her to do it, because she was acting irrationally and would tell her the same thing. There was plenty of food in the house, her medicine for the next two days was in her pillbox (with it organized by time she needed to take it), basically everything I could do without waiting to her every need.


I simply cannot take this anymore. She expects me when I'm home to wait for her every need at any time (once I woke up at 4 am to get some peace and watch a movie; she wasn't asleep). She even said I spend too much time with my friends and I don't care about her. I see my friends on Saturday nights and come home early Sunday morning. When I stepped up to take care of her, I didn't realize I would be expected by her to only do exactly as she wants or get yelled at.

I need advice. If you've read this at all, or read all of it, thank you. I simply do not know what to do because I can't take another month of this.

morenxlife,1618878281,/r/college/comments/muehrj/how_to_get_an_internship_step_2_the_application/,"Hi everyone! I got a lot of positive feedback on my last post so here’s the next step in the internship process.


Okay so you’ve gathered all your potential internship/work sites...now it’s time to actually *apply*. 

I understand this can be an incredibly grueling process and industries have totally different standards - for tech they’ll want to see useful projects whereas in the humanities they may be more interested in your writing and research skills - which may add to any confusion. Whatever it is the industry and organization is looking for, make sure to highlight how you meet those needs (even if you feel like you don’t meet all of the qualifications!) by doing thorough research - this will guide how you structure your cover letter, resume, other application materials + what you share in your interview.

Please remember that most students usually apply to tons of internship programs, many receive multiple rejection letters, and none of it is a personal affront. There’s always going to be someone with a better application than you and there’s always going to be someone with a worse application than you, so don’t let this define your self worth or think it’s indicative of how successful you or your career will be. 

If you want to improve, ask for feedback from the hiring committee (but they may not be able to give any), an advisor, or industry professional but *don’t* torture yourself with any mistakes you may have made. 

General Advice:
Double check eligibility! This is especially important if you’re a college freshman, sophomore, or recent grad (1 year or less out of college). A lot of internships have restrictions on who is eligible to apply, which means underclassmen and new grade are frequently excluded (or, are not considered a priority applicant) from the applicant pool. 

Double check the requirements! One of the worst feelings is missing out on a great opportunity over a silly mistake - make sure you know which documents you have to provide for an application and when you to have submit it. It doesn’t matter how great your resume is if you’re missing a letter of recommendation - to keep things fair, a vast majority of companies will automatically decline to review an incomplete application. 

If an organization doesn’t have internship information on their website buuuut you still really want to intern there, you CAN “cold email” (straight up asking if you can intern there while proving a copy of your resume, despite the company lacking a formal internship program). If possible, look for a department specific email or an employee’s email rather a general, company-wide one. This is more likely to work at a small, local company/organization and it’s also more likely this internship will be unpaid. 

If you know someone who has interned there/is interning there or is currently working at your target organization, then ask them questions about the company + application process. They may help, they may not; the conversation may be beneficial, ultimately it might not be - regardless, it doesn’t really hurt to ask (especially for organizations with a giant applicant pool).

Quality over quantity. This may vary upon your field, but applying to dozens of jobs probably means your capacity to research the company and why you want to work there is pretty limited and this subpar work tends to lead to a subpar application. I’ve seen wayyyy too many posts about students applying to 50+ companies, wasting their time and energy. Narrow down your top dozen or so choices and pour energy into creating an application someone will want to look twice. For anecdotal evidence, I applied to 8 internships for Summer, was accepted to 3, rejected by 3, withdrew from 1, and ghosted by 1, giving me a success rate of 37.5% which is pretty decent! 

If you get rejected during one application cycle this doesn’t mean you can’t apply again! I’ve received two acceptance letters and two rejection letters from the same company - if you really want to work there there’s no shame in being persistent. 

Keep your LinkedIn updated! I don’t mean that after every new resume addition you need to create a post that you’re “excited and humbled to accept an offer at Company X,” (though you may be encouraged to by the company itself) but make sure all your accomplishments and descriptions are up to date, all the information on there (including comments you’ve made) are things you are comfortable with an employer seeing, and that you’ve utilized every inch of space LinkedIn provides for an employer to get to know you, your interests, and your goals (especially your Summary and Featured sections, which tend to be woefully underused). 

Utilize LinkedIn’s “Summary” section to create a quick blurb about yourself, your school/your year in school, a bit about your personal background (ex: maybe you’re a proud Minnesotan? A first gen college student?), what you’re studying and how this connects to your interests and career goals, and any additional information you feel is necessary. 

Take advantage of LinkedIn’s “Feature” section to highlight any interesting projects you’d like an employer to learn about, any interesting achievements, (did your school write an article about you for winning an award or scholarship? link it here!) etc.

The Application Process, Step by Step:
(Organizing, Resume/Cover Letter, Letters of Rec., Transcript, Essays, Submission)

	1.	Organizing your applications. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE to keep track of deadlines throughout this process - I cannot stress enough how easy it is to get overwhelmed by school, your job, extracurriculars, and life’s many responsibilities and forget about an application deadline. It doesn’t matter how intelligent, experienced, or qualified you are - if you miss the deadline there is a 99.999% chance they wouldn’t let you turn in an application late. 
	2.	I recommend making a Google Folder where you keep alllllllll your application materials - a document to track application deadlines (a spreadsheet may be best if you’re planning to apply to a lot of companies), standard documents (recent transcript and letters of recommendation IF you are allowed to see your LOR), application questions, cover letters, etc. 
	3.	In the document where you track deadlines, note when you asked people for letters of recommendation, when the recommenders submitter a LOR, when you submitted an application, got rejected, etc. This will allow you to know when to follow up on things (ex: you asked someone a LOR 3 weeks ago and haven’t gotten a response, you can tell based on your deadlines sheet it’s time to follow up) and take the appropriate action. 
	4.	Update your resume (and cover letter, if you use a cover letter template). Your resume is one of the most important - if not the most important - component of your application and can truly make or break an application. If you don’t have one already make a “Master Resume” - this will be a large document (more than one page) that contains all your education, work, leadership, and volunteer experiences + scholarships and awards. After creating a bullet point description for each experience (and it can be several bullet points, the idea is that you can eventually copy and paste different lines to customize your resume for each application), have someone else (preferably an advisor or someone working full time in your industry) review your work and encourage them to be absolutely BRUTAL in their review. It can be a serious ego bruise, but it’s better that they catch it than realize you made mistakes after submitting the application. Repeat this step until you have a Master Resume you’re happy with. Also, make sure to update this regularly (1-2x an academic term and after every new accomplishment). 
	5.	The same principle can be applied to cover letters - create a standard formula or set of topics to cover, then adjust it to fit the organization. 
	6.	After this, you should be able to create a 1 page resume to accompany each application. When the 1 page version is completed, I still recommend having another person double check your work for any grammatical errors or formatting issues. I’m not sure if a “standard resume” format truly exists, since different countries, industries, companies, and hiring managers have their own preferences. As a general rule of thumb, limit the amount of “distractions” (bright colors, images, symbols), use strong, diverse action verbs to describe accomplishments (instead of “wrote” use “composed”), and quantify your experiences (instead of “fulfilled customer orders” write “fulfilled 10,000 customer orders on a weekly basis”).
	7.	If you don’t have a lot of previous internship experience, highlight any projects you’ve completed, completions you’ve won, papers you’ve written, research, leadership, awards, etc. If you’ve had a job before but don’t feel like it’s “relevant” (shoutout to my fellow fast food workers) still include it, but emphasize transferable skills like efficiency and customer service. 
	8.	Ask for letters of recommendation EARLY! I’ve heard 1-2 months is best practice, especially if you’re asking a professor who receives dozens of requests. I recommend doing this right after you’re done making your resume, as many recommenders may ask for your resume or another document to help guide their LOR. Be specific in what you want them to write - if you want to highlight your strong research skills then ask them to do do directly and politely, they’re not mind readers! Give them as much detail as possible about the internship - what company is it at, what are the highlights of the program, what’s the deadline, are there specific qualifications the company is searching for? This is important to know so they can write a thorough letter. Make sure to follow up with them - at the latest - a week before the LOR is due; there have definitely been students who couldn’t complete an application due to a late LOR and it’s a crappy feeling, to say the least.  
	9.	Request your transcript early, especially if the company wants a physical copy of it! At some schools, requesting transcripts can be expensive and time consuming so I recommend getting this out of the way as early as you can to make sure you have the financial resources for it and that it’ll arrive in time. 
	10.	If you’re in an industry that typically asks for essays as part of the application process *cried in humanities major* try to create a standard essay answer for questions like “Why are you passionate about x topic?,” “What are your career goals and how can x organization help you meet these goals?,” “Why do you want to intern for x company?,” “Please write about one major issue and how you envision solving it.” Again, I’m studying political science + environmental policy so these questions tend to be more geared towards humanities major,  but I would venture to say that each industry has a pretty standard set of questions, so find out what they are and be prepared to answer it. Whenever you apply for internships, SAVE all the questions and identify the common patterns - this will save you so much time in the end. 
	11.	Think of the essay/cover letter as a chance to create a strong, cohesive narrative that complements your resume and other application materials. Ultimately, the entire application is a storytelling exercise for the candidate. 
	12.	Group applications in folders based on topics to fill them out even faster. For example, at Companies A - D their internship programs revolve around electoral politics while Companies E - H revolve around climate change; develop a standard answer (using the advice in the previous bullet point) for each topic - electoral politics and climate change - and apply it to the relevant applications. Though still time consuming, it’s easier than developing something totally original each time. For my junior summer internship hunt, I did this and the essay portion of the application process was pretty much a breeze. 
	13.	After you’ve assembled all your application materials, go ahead and have someone double check it again. Yes, the name of the game here is double checking! Again, I recommend an advisor or professional of some type who’s more likely to be brutally (but in a good way) honest with you.
	14.	Make sure to submit it in the correct application portal - even if a posting is shown on a third party website (LinkedIn) they may want it submitted to their own company site portal, to a specific email, etc. Read the instructions! This is basically your first test as an intern. 
	15.	If the portal or individual you are submitting the application to notes that you are supposed to get an email confirmation (this confirms you did actually submit something) then make sure you actually get this confirmation email. If for whatever reason a company says they never received an application for you this is your “receipt.” 
	16.	*Fight* the urge to panic and demand a response from them in one week. Remember that hosting interns is a smalllllll component of an organization’s work. If they have an application timeline (ex: round 1 will be completed by x date, round 2 will be completed by y date) expect them to be late/fall behind. Is it fair that we have to submit everything on time while they may delay the response process? Probably not, but unfortunately, that’s the game. If you have special circumstances where you need to hear back sooner (ex: you’ve received multiple offers), then contact the relevant person but know they may not be able to accommodate you.

thrownawayboy,1317284769,/r/AskReddit/comments/kv38h/reddit_what_am_i_doing_wrong_with_my_life/,"[This is a throwaway account.]

Redditors:

I'm 24 years old and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong with my life.

I know nobody's perfect. I know everyone makes mistakes. But my missteps over the last few years have had overwhelming consequences, and I desperately need some guidance.

In 2008, I took in my best friend and his brother after their mother kicked them out. I knew my best friend partied on occasion, but I was not aware he was hiding a full-blown heroin addiction while he was staying with me. Three months later, I was evicted after money was stolen from me and I couldn't afford to make rent. I moved into my mom's house, gave her a good portion of my last two paychecks, but ultimately had to quit my job because she refused to drive me to and from work, and the only bus running through the neighborhood took a route in the opposite direction from the store's location.

I spend the first half of 2009 behind a closed door. I felt that eviction was akin to someone kidnapping my child. I met a guy online, through MySpace, in March, and I would stay up all night to be online for him to talk with. He came and went as he pleased, but said he loved me. I loved him too. I started attending a nondenominational church, and talked with the lead pastor about joining the ministry academy. Even though this boy I grew to love was a staunch atheist, he encouraged me to go forward with becoming a minister.

My sister began using meth, and I would warn my mom perpetually that if she didn't stop handing my sister $20 and the car keys every night, something bad would happen. At the end of April, on the morning me and this boy first met in person, Child Protective Services arrived at my mother's house and took my nephews in state custody.

My mother, understandably, couldn't handle losing her grandchildren. She demanded my sister pack her things and leave, but I argued that this was the worst thing to do. My sister was an addict, had just lost her kids only a few hours before, and did not need to lose the only roof she had over her head. Somewhere toward the tail end of that argument, I am told I'm taking advantage of my mother. I end up on a friend's mother's living room floor, my dad intervenes to give my sister a place to stay.

One week later, the boy I was seeing left me for an 18-year-old kid. I received an offline IM from him one day then he blocked me and seemingly disappeared.

I spent the rest of the summer trying to find work and finally did. I landed a web design position but that quickly turned into micromanagement hell. I was expected to be up and available online by 9AM but not log off until 3-4AM each night, 7 days a week. I was being paid a weekly salary, and eventually couldn't keep up.

Around the time I was readying to quit, the boy sends me an e-mail and I decide to be a shoulder to lean on. The affair didn't love him. I spent the next two months with someone begging my time only to use it in a way that was like subjecting me to emotional lashing. I start drinking more often to relax, but this becomes ammo and the boy begins assuming that my life is in shambles because I'm an addict. The abuse gets out of hand and I decide to let him go.

One month later, I ask a close family friend who receives a large SS settlement if I can borrow some money to get back on my feet. My mother intervenes and argues to that I would not be able to pay her back because I don't have a job. The friend agrees to help, but only a little, and gives my mother the money. My mother then escorts me to the local community college where the $100 I'm allowed to borrow is spent on GED tests because otherwise I ""may waste it.""

A week or so later, I go to visit my sister and find she now has an apartment filled with new furniture, her rent has been paid in full for months, she has new clothes and a new Droid; and she was given a car.

In November 2009, I decide to enroll in college. I figure it's a way out of this cycle. Being 22, I have to include at least one parent's income on my FAFSA. (I didn't have enough witnesses or sources to verify that I had been kicked out.) My mother refuses to disclose her income, stating that I need to ""go talk to the Department of Economic Security and get food stamps or something."" Two weeks of calling back to ask again, and I finally end up having to ask a live-in friend of hers to sneak me her taxes.

At the end of December, I call my mom and ask if she can consider letting me stay with her while I'm enrolled in college.  (The college is a 30 minute walk from her house.) She refuses. I try again a few days later and she reluctantly agrees to let me sleep on the downstairs couch only on the days before I have class. This doesn't end up working out very well, as the only times I can eat at her house are when they fix a family meal, and the only times I can sleep are after their shows end at 11:30pm each night. I'm forbidden from entering most rooms in her house, and I have to ask to take a shower.

I make some friends at college and start to open up about what's happening with me. A lot of people offer ideas for me to leave, or places to stay temporarily. By the end of the semester, however, my mother's live-in friend and my sister (who are also attending the college) have convinced most people I'm just making things up. Furthermore, rumors get spread about me having habits like not flushing the toilet. It doesn't dawn on most people until my sister nonchalantly tells me in front of a group of people on campus that ""if [I'm] expecting people to love me, they don't.""

A few months later, the close family friend who lent me the $100 passes away. I find out from her son that she never asked for a dime to be returned by my sister, however I ""needed to learn a lesson about borrowing from others."" I did pay her back. It came out of the very small disbursement I received after tuition and books.

I spend the summer of 2010 staying with friends. In August, when I receive a slightly larger disbursement from the college, I decide to invest in a cheap car. I end up losing $1400 altogether because the car could not be legally driven within city limits due to emissions standards. The law in my state gave the original owner the discretion to disclose whether the vehicle could pass emissions because the vehicle was sold in the county.

I do well as my second semester rolls in. One month before finals, my laptop fries out. I have no money to replace it, and I end up having to spend late nights in the computer commons writing papers. I walk home in pitch black five nights a week just to get things done. I manage to pull myself up from near failure.

Christmas rolls around. Everyone in the family celebrates, buying each other gifts and inviting tons of friends over for a big dinner. I get two cards, no gifts, and spend five hours hiding in either the bathroom or garage to avoid having to sit in a corner and watch everyone celebrate.

3 days later, my mom comes home from her office and tells me to ""pack my shit."" This happened without provocation, without warning. I try to ignore it (thinking maybe she had a bad day) but my mother follows me around the house as I try to grab as much as I can fit into my backpack. I call a friend's mom for help. As she's driving down the road, away from my mother's house, I get a text message from my mom saying she wants my phone back too.

January 2011, I have no money, no job, nothing. I have no phone, and I have no secure address to receive my student aid funds. The college holds the check, but what I get is gone in two weeks. I was able to replace my computer and phone, but did not calculate the costs of getting to and from the campus. A few weeks into classes, I'm broke and cannot afford to take the bus anymore. If I withdraw, I have to send back the money I've already spent. I decide to withdraw from as many classes as possible, but let at least a few fail me. There's nothing I can do... no one can afford to pay the gas to get me back and forth. I asked.

I spend the summer learning about learning. It's the best investment of time I've made in my life. Unfortunately, I also spend it fighting to receive funding for college. After finishing all the paperwork and attending workshops for academic probation, the school changes its student aid policies. This change does not consider students just recently placed on probation. I end up on restriction, and the school states I was expected to attend the summer intersession. Two months of fighting later, I'm attending the current semester with funding only guaranteed for this one semester. I'm unable to register for Spring.

Today, things fell apart in a big way. I've done a lot to help others, from holding doors open to paying for others' bus tickets, to being a shoulder a stranger can lean on. I support my professors in their respective passions. But today, a professor who knows me very well refused to let me sit for an exam within the last five minutes of class. The alarms I'd set in my phone did not go off due to an unlucky software glitch in an app, but I was told this excuse is some ""elaborate story."" I was told it would not be fair to let me sit for an exam that could ultimately be the difference between financial and academic suspension and finishing my degree. Why? Because to her, there is a hypothetical impact on other students that is somehow more significant than me losing the chance to attend college? Because it can be proven that I intentionally slept past the first hour of class?

At this point, I don't know what I've been doing wrong. I don't know why everyone I meet is a ship passing in the night, why people finding boyfriends and making friends happens to the people around me but not me. I don't know what I'm doing to earn what I see as the worst return on karmic investment. For crying out loud, three weeks ago I saved a man from going into a diabetic coma, but I'm ignored when I ask a stranger how they're doing.

Between the constant physical pain of having severe scoliosis, my wisdom teeth coming in, having numerous cystic growths in the cartilage and lobes of my ears, deep stretch marks across my back (that everyone thinks are scars from physical abuse), a downvote widow's peak, thin hair, a very effeminate walk and voice, and all the ""you need to eat"" comments AND all of this shit, I'm starting to understand why people may do stupid things to themselves.

What is going on here, Redditors? What am I doing wrong? What needs to change?


**TL;DR Each time I try to rebuild my life, it comes crashing down. When I'm volunteering to be there for everyone, to help and support them at the expense of myself, it matters. When I actually need them to pull through for me, they justify not doing so and even make a mockery of me. If being mean solved this, I wouldn't get the same result from times I've tried being an asshole to everyone. So what can I change? What am I not seeing, knowing, or understanding that will stop this shit from happening?**


#
EDIT: I should also mention that a lot of this has spurned severe anxieties to some things. I can't eat in front of people anymore because I'm constantly worried someone will tell me I'm eating *their* food, not my own. I can't sit close to other people because I'm constantly worried someone will ask me move away from them. I don't talk to many strangers anymore because I've come to assume that I'm just impeding their time. I spend a lot of time daydreaming about things like relationships, or having lots of friends, or being able to be considered a positive influence through my writing or music. These anxieties have brought me to attempt suicide twice in my life, and while I don't feel like I'm risking another attempt, I can't speak for a few months down the road... especially if things don't look up.

*EDIT 2: Thank you guys for sharing some words of wisdom with me. The general consensus seems that I'm behaving like a pushover, and instead of thinking about how the situation affects me first and foremost, I'm only considering how I can avoid things affecting others.*",AskReddit,Reddit: What am I doing wrong with my life? [throwaway],http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kv38h/reddit_what_am_i_doing_wrong_with_my_life/,1317306369.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,15.166666666666666
Viperbunny,1349287270,/r/AskReddit/comments/10vxa3/how_do_i_explain_to_a_clingy_friend_i_enjoy_her/,"TL;DR: LONG STORY: I have a very clingy friend who insists on coming over for hours at a time and gets really upset with me when I tell her I can't hang out. She gets offended easily and I could use advice dealing with the situation.


I have a friend who insists on coming over every Monday, do lunch and then hang around all day. I am 7 months pregnant, high risk, and she never takes no for an answer. She wants homework help, advice, and to be around me all the time. I like hanging out a bit, but she always stays hours past what I can deal with and asks for help on things that I have no ability to help her with, especially course work.

 Now, I wouldn't mind, but I have no context what so ever because I am not taking these classes. She will not ask for help on a confusing part, she will point to what she has to do and says, ""I don't get it, can you tell me what to do."" Um, no, I don't know what your teacher wants, I wasn't there and therefore have not been shown how to do it, and you don't seem to understand any part of the assignment enough that a little help would be enough. Then she basically wants me to write her paper. I tell her no. I can help, but she never knows what the teacher is looking for. I try to have a discussion with her and then she will try to write down what I say. When she asks me to go slower so she can type it, I say no, write your own paper. I will discuss it, I will help, but I am not doing her work. Then she just proclaims, ""I'll send you it tomorrow and you edit it and send it back."" No asking, just stating it. I try to tell her I am busy, but she insists it won't take long. 

If I tell her I'm not feeling well, so I have to cancel, she will either try to insist on coming over anyway, or just show up to ""keep me company."" She wants me to give her a key to my house so she can just come in and I wouldn't have to ""worry"" about letting her in. Um, no. Sorry. This is my house. The only people who have keys are our parents (in case we lock ourselves out or we go away and they volunteer to check on things), my sister, because she was helping me out my last pregnancy, and a friend of ours who lives down the road and is like a brother to my husband. They don't just show up and let themselves in. They always let us know if they plan to or think they will be stopping by.

I am not a touchy person. I just don't like being touched. The only exception to this rules is my husband and my cats. My friend comes in and rubs and kisses my bump over and over again. Then the other days she grabbed my boobs and was like ""wow, they did get huge!"" Normally, I would say something, but I was so shocked, I didn't know how to react. Normally, I say something, but the only time I've told her something bothers me, she felt like the worst person in the world and wouldn't stop apologizing, and it was a small thing. She stays and hangs out all day. I am 7 months pregnant, I get tired fast. No, I am not working right now, but I am high risk after losing a child to a genetic disorder last year. I need to not be stressed and I need to rest, a lot. I'm not on bed rest yet, but am told that I could be put on bed rest any time. I am to the point where I have tests every week to make sure the baby's activity levels are good (twice a week), regular appointments every 2 weeks (and soon it will be every week), and a monthly ultrasound. I get tired just doing chores around the house. Going out for  a few hours wipes me. Then we go back to the house and stays for several more hours. I know she will be stuck at school because she lives and hour away, but that isn't my problem. I know it sucks, I had that happen to me before, but I found a way to deal with it. I don't sleep well at night, and typically sleep the most between 6am and noon. This isn't by choice or to be lazy, it's just that the baby kicks me all night and I can really only sleep when she does. When I get tired, or lightheaded, I am supposed to lay down. When that happens, I want to rest. I can't rest when she is over because she wants my undivided attention. When I say I just want to rest, she says that's fine, she'll come over and we can watch TV in bed...NO! Sorry, my bed is my bed. It's not a hang out spot. It is for me and my husband (kitties are allowed). If I feel I need to lay in bed, I don't want friends over. 

She makes me feel guilty saying the best part of her week is seeing me. I like seeing her, but sometimes I need my space. I know she is having problems and I'm sorry for that. I get she has issues with her kids and husband, and that she worries about losing her house, and if I could help, I would. I don't have that kind of cash. Yes, my husband and I are comfortable, but we aren't rich. I go out with her once a week, but my husband and I have been saving up, paying off our credit cards, and saving for the baby. When we want to do something, we set aside money to do it. We don't just spend money to spend money and that is how we are not drowning in debit. Yes, we have some debt our card, but we pay it down every month (not always fully but a good portion of it) in order to continue to build our credit (which is great). We make good decisions, when we bought our condo, we bought something that we could afford, not something that would stain the budget. My friend has an old house that they paid too much for and they are constantly renovating even thought they have no money. She is a kind women and helps out some of her neighbors sometimes, but because of that (as they never pay her back), she is now struggling to pay for anything. If it was just they were a little behind, that would be one thing, but they are really far behind and the kind of money they need is no where near what I could even consider giving. She never asks, but sometimes I feel like she is hinting that it would be great. Hell, I'd be willing to cook lunch at my house to save money, but she wants to go out. I would even go to places that are less expensive, but again, she is specific on what she likes. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I like spending some time with her, but I have to give up my whole day every Monday, and sometimes she will just stop by on other days and take up the whole day. I wouldn't mind if she gave me space when I need it, but she insists on staying even when I clearly state that I wish to be alone. I don't want to hurt her feelings. She is really sensitive on certain things, and once it happens she never forgets it. She can be a great friend, and be there for me too, and I like helping her out when I can, but there seems to be no way to tell her no to things without her completely flipping out.

This baby will be born between the end of November and the beginning of December. I hope that at that point she will understand that I will not be having her over for hours every week. The first few weeks we have our daughter home, we are limiting our visits with everyone. We get they will want to see her, but we have to have limits so our families won't move in with us (I wish I were kidding). We figure people can come over for an hour or two at a time. By the next semester, even though the baby will be a few months old, I am not going to want to go out for hours every week. Going out occasional sounds great, but going out for hours and hours is not realistic. And I am not going to want people hanging around for 6 hours at a time. I'm sorry, but I am only going to be able to sleep when my daughter sleeps, I can't imagine every week for a day or two, getting no sleep at all. I don't think I should have to explain that it is nap time and she has to leave. I swear she'll just be like, ""great, I'll bring my pj's next time and I can stay over!""

I could use some advice. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I know I have to be direct. I get she doesn't have a lot of friends she trust and I am glad that she trusts me. I enjoy her company, but I feel like she doesn't hear me when I say no. It becomes a negotiations. She'll start with, ""well I'll just come for a little bit,"" or, ""I'll keep you company."" I say no, and sometimes she shows up anyway, ""just to check on me."" I appreciate she cares, but I need some space. 

In the last year, I have grown more of a backbone. My mother was like this (except she lives two hours away) and I have had to be harsh at points to get her to understand that I will not be pushed around. It was hard, there are periods of time she throws a hissy fit and won't talk to me, or will try to push the limits I set up and get mad and try to guilt me when I won't budge. It isn't about being stubborn, it's about making sure she doesn't walk all over me. This friend is starting to get like this. She has become increasingly needy. I won't to be there for her, to be a good friend and help her, but it seems that any time I say no it is a problem. Everyone tells me to stand my ground and then they want to be the exception to the rule.

Part of me says it's just one day a week and that isn't a lot. But the problem is it always starts this way. Then she will be like, ""I'm in the area on Wednesdays too."" I don't mind doing lunch, but I literally get up early to get showered and dressed so I will be ready for when she comes over, I go to lunch with her, I run any errands she needs to run with her, and then she'll come back to my house for 4 to 6 hours. I can't get the things I need to get done finished. I can't nap, and I have to change my whole food schedule, this wouldn't be a big deal, except I have to eat certain things at certain times because of the gestational diabetes, and it is harder to do when I eat out. If I get tired, I am supposed to nap. If I have any contractions, I need to lay down and drink water right away. I can't do that when she is there. If I told her I was having contractions she would insist on staying with me. The truth is, they happen, most are just braxtion hicks, and they go away after one or two, but that is because I do what I am supposed to and not push it physically. I know people watch me like a time bomb, but 9 times out of 10 I just need to rest. If I were working, they would have put me out of work by now because of my risk factors. I know what is normal and when to call the doctors. It comes down to resting a lot an limiting my activities. Anytime I say I can't hang out she gets dejected, acts very disappointed and makes me feel like an awful person. Then she pushes the issue to try to come over anyway. Oh, and if she has to use the bathroom in the morning, she hates using the school bathrooms so she will wake me up and ask to use my bathroom. If it were an emergency, I get it, but the school is closer than my house (which is 5 minutes away).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while since my college days and I see lots of posts here detailing both the good and bad about their college lives and the inquiries on how to make bad situations better.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your productivity velocity/Average Task completion for subject=Necessary time sacrifice.

Here's a very simple and easy way for most people to know how much time they need to devote to a single assignment. Measure your time to completion. Time how long it takes you to get it done. Try to comprehend how hard it was for you during the process and see if you can speed up your overall time through tricks and flow enhancing techniques. These can be striking out all the easiest questions so you save all the time to the hardest--not only for multiple choice but for those I.D. short answer questions that you can definitely get points on when you define the term for each and every one of them instead of stalling on trying to come up for an example for a single one. Knowing your working throughput makes you able to accurately set up timeboxes and deadlines to help you measure your overall time and set up cushions.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to help you know when to stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, you heard me right, stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

I came from a high-level semi-international level Chinese school that did nothing but death-march kids through college-level material in 7-8 courses for years so the ones that made it out of high school got good by committing to two choices. We got good at suffering more than anyone else, riding at exams with eldritch curses vomited forth from our lips driven by fears ancestral disappointment and utter destruction or, and this is less common, we got really good at the metathinking and mechanics of doing the work. The cost of learning advanced trig is 4 days of hard brutal cramming. The cost of memorizing all the types of questions for the predictable exam is 4 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you plan to be a master, I suggest you don't obliterate your own minds limited willpower. And considering that most people don't come from ridiculous studying death marches since they could write, you don't have the drilled and practiced ability to suffer eternally while not losing any productivity. This is not a slight against you nor a benefit to us. It's just how you were molded by your environment and practice. There are benefits and losses to both. I explain the damage that death marching does soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is one idea that did miracles for me in college for my studies, its the concept of minimal time and effort spent to get an A-.

&amp;#x200B;

Spend much more than what is required on average, that bleeds over to other subjects, your hobbies, your clubs, and your career development time.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not a good thing. That's time waste. Time waste will gut you and bleed you good and fast when the assignments come avalanching down at the end of the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get buried or you spend the rest of your time spraying crap back to your professors to crawl your way out.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

2. You don't have free time, you have expendable time.

&amp;#x200B;

Timebox your hours by the week, and absolutely by the day. If you enjoy having a spot of fun go for it. It's important to lubricate your brain and oil your fortitude with rejuvenating activities. Know that you have to include some time for yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, you'll need it.

  
Often, I advise people to plan around their necessary time sacrifice for academia because that's a constant but day to day, that's up to you. If you don't have class on Monday and you want to go hog-wild running around buck-naked with an airhorn clenched between your cheeks, go for it. Just know that time will be coming out of your weekly allotted time. And potentially a restraining order.

&amp;#x200B;

Students often joke about the social life, studying, sleeping triangle. You can choose two. Or if you're an engineer, just one. This is true for the average student perhaps, but you are not aiming to be the average student. I hope. Try to keep an average of your sleeping time. If you feel most rested from 11-6, go for that and do that consistently. If you party wild and hard, I recommend building a routine of power naps that will keep you charged across your days. Keep your tanks fueled or prepare to stall and break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Factor this into your timebox as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Hobbies, clubs, careers, and relationships are major concerns that must be addressed as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concept for this part: pick your priorities in the timebox but don't forsake all the others entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specialize, but remain cross-functional. This will save you when it comes time to build a life as an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Prepare for the future and accept the chaos.

&amp;#x200B;

""Your future is bright.""

&amp;#x200B;

This platitude is blasted at you more times than your roommate towards your shower curtains when they think you're not watching--side note, when living together set clear boundaries but always be prepared to bleach everything and have an out. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

Is entirely bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

You have no idea how your life is going to go. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

To counter this quote with a quote from Unforgiven, ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it.""

&amp;#x200B;

You don't get what you deserve. You don't get what you work for sometimes. Keep your mind on the infinite game rather than the limited one. Know what is true to you and what you want to be working for. And if you don't, accept the discomfort knowing that you are in the majority and aren't behind the curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, there is no curve.

&amp;#x200B;

So many of my classmates from high school, boys and girls who were monsters of art and science, flunked out of college. The material was easy to them. They could death march forever. But there were not prepared for the freedom. And they lacked the self-discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, too many of us came to college to early, I would argue. Just because you can study forever doesn't mean you will. The allegory of the cave makes sense here with the cave being constant studying and the light outside being self-management and independence. In high school, what is pitched is that you have no choice. People will ride you like a rented mule in a field of snakes. Your parents, your teachers, your student leaders. They own you, on some level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then you get to college and no one truly cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you learn that life isn't about managing stress or pressure if you're used to that. It's about managing the apathy.

&amp;#x200B;

This destroys kids who, by all other metrics, should be ready.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, just because you're good at death marching and doing academics doesn't mean you're ready for life. A few classmates that graduated along with me went into rehab.

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs. Alcohol. Depression. Loneliness. This is common. You think you can suffer forever. Until you can't.

  
They were high achievers but they broke down and gave up right after the finish line because in their minds, it was all for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

They went to school because mom and dad told them to. Or just because it was expected of them. Or they did majors they didn't care about.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to find your own way. Find your own reason. Spend time trying to understand that. The world has very little meaning to it. Existence, if you aren't religious or spiritual, doesn't mean anything beyond 42. That's an absolute standpoint. You're looking at the relative.

&amp;#x200B;

Be pragmatic with your mind and soul. Let's not bullshit ourselves here, if you hate pre-med or accounting but think that the job is going to make you happy, you got another thing coming. The money might make you happy but let me tell you, after a certain threshold when it gets to be enough, you stop working for the money and instead for the task. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coincidentally, this is also how wage-slaving works. It's low engagement low pay work sold to you as experience or with the potential to make you rich. If you have to do these jobs, do them briefly but just leave. Loyalty is a desiccated corpse these days for a good majority of the companies that I have trained within. You are not obliged to suffer. Apologies for the tangent but it is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to college, keep in mind the fun of these years is about the journey. Education is about more than books. Understand yourself. Know your limitations. Know your flaws. Know your strengths. Try to know them as objectively as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some hard truths might come at you, like the foundations of self-loathing for example. I learned during college that though I hated myself at times for the wrong reasons, I deserved that hate by all accounts because I didn't address the core issue. It's like beating yourself without improving so you can have more room to beat yourself later. Of course you're going to hate yourself its a self-perpetuating cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Engage your flaws on your terms. Engage the darkest moments on your terms. Don't think about yourself when you're in a depressed mood. Don't make choices when you're down. Be on the offense. Especially with yourself. Build on yourself. Break down yourself. Rebuild yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But do it while you have control.

&amp;#x200B;

No one ever won a fight by taking a punch.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need help, find it with professionals but also with friends and family if you can. The wholeness of support can drill into our very pattern driven minds that we can get better if by osmosis alone.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Don't be afraid to walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished college with a GPA of 3.8. I was a writer for several clubs, the vice-president for one, a president for another, a division-three athlete, while working part-time. I finished two majors in four years.

&amp;#x200B;

You might have bad grades. You might be thinking of dropping out. You might have already dropped out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not worth more than you. I mean this objectively and subjectively. My success does not correlate to your failure. The truth is, with the vastness of experiences and our lives, I don't know what you went through to get here. You probably don't know me. Hell, I could have been lying this entire time and just been a sapient walrus learning human behavior online in hopes of preparing for the eventual uprising led by our lord and sovereign Jamie Hyneman. However, comparing your darkest moments and your missteps to my victories and glories is a lot like saying I won while you tripped briefly on a set of stairs. A set of stairs that extends forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Know this, you are not done unless you say you are. This isn't some motivational speech bullshit. It's not me trying pump you up. It just the truth. The wheel turns on. The show goes on. The highlight reel ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I just told you all about how well I was doing in school. What I didn't tell you was following the end of college, I felt like doing nothing because I had no goals for myself for the future because I didn't care much for me and so I just sat in a dead-end job for half a year because.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was made for bigger things but that's not what always happens. Sometimes things just go sideways. But they keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, if you truly, definitely don't want to stay in college, that's okay too.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to live for yourself eventually. Make your own choices. Being an adult is about taking responsibility for your own life. Nothing more. The choice is up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

If the disappointment of others makes you deny your own will, know that the price of that is going to be paid by you. They will not suffer being you in misery. They will, however, complain regarding why you are miserable, as I have observed with multiple peers and their friends who are parochial if I am to describe them gently.

Anyway, I'd like to end this tentative smattering of advice with a shameless plug for a book series, The Stormlight Archive. Yes, it's fantasy. Yes, it feels like an anime sometimes. But even if you don't like those things, I implore you to read a single chapter in the third book, Oathbringer, titled, the Girl Who Looked Up. It helped a few people I know out of some dark places. Maybe it might do some good to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, happy semesters and good luck.

[deleted],1337201353,/r/AskReddit/comments/tqixm/unsure_what_to_do_after_brother_in_law_almost/,"My dad owns a construction company. I've worked for him as I guess what you would call the secretary since I was 16. I handle all the paper work, bookings, meetings, phone calls etc. I'll admit the pay sucks but I guess I'm doing it more as a favor. In return I get to live in their giant mansion rent free and eat their food. My family is Russian and old fashioned. They're convinced a girl is supposed to stay at home until she gets married. He says there's no point for me to live in my own apartment slave away for rent money when their house is big enough for ten families. I don't mind it and I'll admit, I wouldn't want any other job. They pay for a lot of my things even if I don't ask. So I don't feel bad I sort of have this system where if the item I want is something I want and not need I'll pay for it myself. Like video games, nail polish etc. My dad sometimes shows up with random expensive items every few months. I know it's sort of a ""I don't really know you and never spend any time with you so here, have a brand new Xbox"". He's done it since I was a kid. 

My sister married the worlds biggest douchebag. He wants to be rich but he doesn't want to get his hands dirty. He has a huge temper, say the wrong thing and you better hide or you'll see something flying at you. He's really, really big on saying hurtful things but can't handle it if someone else say things to him.

My sister was 16 when they started dating. My parents didn't want her dating him. He was about 10 years older than her and they knew he was an alcoholic and knew about his temper. Of course she didn't listen and ended up hating them because of it, she did a lot of stupid shit to hurt my parents. I think they eventually gave up and let her do what she wanted.

I was about 14 at the time. I was a geek, building computers, video games, making money off freelance web design. He had an issue with geeks and would constantly make fun of me. It didn't bother me at all since my entire family makes fun of me for being a geek. I was pretty snarky when I was younger, everytime he would say something to try and hurt me I usually had something to return to him. Like hey, how's your bank account? How does it feel knowing that a 14 year old can make more money than you and I don't even have to leave the house. At first I thought he was mostly joking so I did too but one day after a chair came flying at me I found out he in fact really had issues with geeks.

When I built my first computer I had a friend over who in fact had a huge crush on me but I friend zoned him. He was helping me when my sister and her future husband walked in. I can't remeber what he said but my friend was shocked at how he was treating me and trying to defend me he immediately said ""Whats the point of making fun of nerds? You'll end up working for one someday"". He threw such a fit that he stole the keys to my Camaro and totaled it.

Short story about the car. My dad never had a son and it's really big with Russians to have a son and I know he wishes he did but I guess he's in luck because I love cars. Taking them apart and putting them back together gives the same thrill as if I were doing it on a computer. One weekend we ran into an old retired guy and his Camaro. The car was amazing, had literally never been used. He said he wanted to give the car to his son but the motor was way too powerful. My dad and I admired it and the next day I found out he bought it for me. I wasn't even 16 and couldn't drive. I fucking loved my car. 

My parents tried to hide it from me. My dad said he sold it back to the original owner but my mom couldn't stand lying to me and told me the truth. After my future brother in law got to it, my dad and I decided to sell it instead of fix it. After I found out he totaled it I walked up to him and said ""Seriously just stop. You're the biggest fucking douchebag I have ever met just fucking stop"". He's never said a word to me ever since. It's been 7 years and he can't even look me in the eye. He does however, talk a lot of shit about me. I hear it from family and other friends. It's like he literally has such a huge thing against me he'll go out of his way to talk shit about me.

After they got married he got fired from his job for being lazy, showing up late, drinking on the job etc. He did nothing for years. My sister ended up taking two jobs all while he sat at home and complained about not being rich. After they had their car taken away from them and house my dad did them a huge favor and bought them a house if he promised to get a job. After months my sister begged my dad to give him a job. My dad knew it would be a bad idea but even my dad was too scared to say no. Of course this meant he now has to take orders from me. The very first day my dad told me to not go easy on him because he's family. My dad likes getting the job done.

As expected, he didn't show up on the first day, or the second, or third. I didn't feel like calling him personally so I called my sister and said ""Hey you know dad is doing you a huge favor for giving him a job the least he could do is actually show up"". I asked my dad what he wanted to do, he just got a blank look on his face and said ""Nothing for now"". I knew I had to let it go. I knew my dad was too nice to say something. I knew I had to write his first pay check that he didn't deserve and mail it.

Aparently my sister had told him what I had said over the phone and it pissed him off greatly. My office is above my dads workshop. I knew I was the last one to leave since I always am. There's a window right next to my desk that shows the parking lot and I remember that day there were no cars except mine. I walked down a huge set of stairs and saw him there. I usually try to avoid him as much as possible because I'm afraid I'll open my mouth and end up saying something that will piss him off. I didn't know what to do, I didn't feel like running back upstairs and wait for him to leave. I kept on going. The door wasn't far. I'd lock up and leave. When he noticed me coming down the stairs he laughed and said a bunch of shit. Shit like my parents hated me and I was the biggest pathetic loser on the planet, that I was a burden to my parents and my entire family wished I was dead. I opened my mouth and said ""See you Monday?"". Knowing he's been working for my dad for months but never actually showed up for work for a single day. He immediately threw a wrench at me. I guess all my years of playing video games paid off because I dodged it quickly. I was a little pissed off at that but kept on going. He kept throwing things at me but missing. Clearly drunk. Screw driver, small tools. I had dodged them so far and his aim sucked I figured I could make it to the door. Half way down the stairs I look up. I see a saw blade flying at me. I lost my balance trying to dodge it and ended up falling off half a set of stairs. I hit my head on the edge of one of those metal work bench tables. I don't remember anything after. 

I was in the Hospital for a while after. Aparently the blow to the head caused a seizure and I had multiple seizures while being in the Hospital.

The sad thing is he didn't even bother calling 911 or anyone else. He went home. When I didn't come home for dinner (I am never not home for dinner. I wouldn't miss my moms cooking) and didn't answer my phone my dad came to the office looking for me.

I've been out of the Hospital for a few weeks now but feel absolutely shitty. I feel incredibly weak like energy is constantly being drained out of me. My body tremples. My head feels fucked up. I'm constantly dizzy. Not the spin in your chair dizzy but like warping. It's hard for me to explain to Doctors. Sometimes the dizziness will get so bad I have to lay down and I'll get nauseous. The nausea will cause me to throw up, a lot. The only way to explain how my head feels is I feel like I'm constantly under water. I've had mulriple MRI's but there's nothing wrong with my brain. If I lay completely still and don't move my body will start feeling fine. My head will stop pounding but once I move or get up it goes back to feeling like shit. I'm still undergoing lots of tests but they're taking long.

I guess it doesn't help that I feel somewhat severely depressed. I know I didn't get lucky and find a guy at 16 to marry like my family wanted. I know I didn't go to some fancy University and get some fancy degree. I know I don't have a real job but never thought I needed one. I know I'd rather spend a Friday night at home doing whatever makes me feel good if a bubble bath or video game but my parents have never said anything about my life style. In fact my mom still praises me for not getting into drugs like the many cousins I have. I want to leave. Completely. Move away from my family for good. Get out of their lives and stop being a ""burdon"" but the fact that I can't do anything at all right now pisses me off. I barely finished high school. I've never had any job experience other than working for my dad. I'm scared to death when it comes to driving. What if I get a seizure while driving and cause an accident and kill someone. 

My mom and my dad imedietly talked to me after I woke up in the Hospital begging me not to press charges or even speak of it. I didn't even think of it since him being angry to the point where he wants to kill you is kind of a normal thing. But now, after feeling so shitty for so many weeks it's been on my mind. I know it would tear apart my family. I don't even know if it's a ""case"" or what I would gain from ""winning"". My sister and I have never really got along good. I don't want to make my parents choose a side. I don't want to cause any more drama. I've learend that with my brother in law you smile, never say a word go along with whatever his plan is and everyone is happy.

My brother in law is telling friends and family that he in fact wasn't there at all. My dad caught me watching the security tapes once and locked them in his safe after. I'm not sure if he's hiding them from me so I wont continue to watch them and feel like crap over it or if he's locking them away for some other reason.

Just yesterday my dad got an ear full from my brother in law asking him why he doesn't defend his daughter more (my sister). I know he didn't say anything back to him but he did say to my mom ""What about my other daugther? How am I supposed to defend both of them?"". 

I can let it go. I just wish it never happened because I physically feel like shit.

Please excuse the bad English. It's not my first language.

pickleticker,1326464786,/r/AskReddit/comments/ofg66/hey_reddit_how_have_you_dealt_with_an_undesirable/,"Here's mine, and how I'm dealing:    
*[DISCLAIMER: I know my situation isn't HORRIBLE boo hoo wah etc. It's tolerable but not ideal. It's livable but not comfortable. Things are easily fixable but stubbornly and lazily perpetuated. Therefore, I describe it as undesirable-- not horrible, not awful, not soul-crushingly, completely intolerable. Just undesirable. But feel free to post about situations that may fit those bills, too.]    
[SECOND DISCLAIMER: Yay, it seems I have written a novel.]*   
    
----
             
I lived (mostly) independently for just about five years. I've recently come into hard economic times by making some ill-advised decisions, and the full-time job I have making barely more than minimum wage barely pays my existing bills, feeds me, and gets me to and from work-- I don't have enough to pay rent anymore. I've resorted to moving back in with my parents while I work hard, look for a better &amp; higher paying job, and try to save where I can. Basically, I'm doing the best I can without having to ask for financial assistance from my parents or friends.    
    
My parents are divorced, but they live together. My mom and dad live in separate rooms and get along for the most part. My sister, still in high school, also lives at home, and I have a brother that is currently away at college but occasionally visits home. Together, we are only four or five people in a decently sized ""five bedroom""/three bath (actually four-bedroom with one living area converted into a bedroom) home. The home isn't well-maintained (leaks in showers, drafty windows, poorly patched roof leak, mottled/faded carpet, etc), but it certainly isn't horrible by any stretch of the imagination. Despite the size and accommodations of the house, it feels tiny and cramped because of the way my family lives.     
    
I understand that my parents are doing me a favor by letting me live at home, and they constantly remind me of that fact (""We could kick you out tomorrow,"" etc). I feel that it's an empty threat-- I don't think they would actually kick me out unless I was massively disrespectful. I feel it's just a roundabout way of asking me to ""pay rent"" by doing chores, completing favors, etc. I won't claim to be perfect at chores, but I do all the stuff that I would do for myself when I was living alone, plus I complete random favors for all three family members if I'm asked. I feel that in all household duties that I behave reasonably, like a good roommate might-- cleaning up messes I make, loading/emptying dishwasher, taking out trash, picking up something from the grocery, etc. My mom will mostly clean up after herself as well, but the same cannot be said about my sister and my dad. We have found dishes in my sister's room that look like science experiments gone wrong, and my dad is more likely to ask ""why hasn't the trash been taken out yet!?"" than to just take it out himself. In short, I feel have two bad roommates and one good one.    
        
The communication skills between family members are downright awful. For example, we have room for four cars in our driveway. Knowing that I was the first to arrive home and would likely be the first to leave tomorrow morning, I parked in a way so that nobody could park behind me. Because my dad has been away on business, I knew that our (mom's, sister's, mine) three cars could fit, and I wouldn't have to worry about waking my mom or my sister up so I could get their keys and un-block myself (which, regrettably, has happened a lot). Unfortunately, my dad arrived home late last night after I had fallen asleep. Nobody told me he was coming home-- not him, not my mom, not my sister. I had no idea. Thus, I woke up this morning to find him parked on the lawn. I know he's not going to be happy about it, and I know that my family likely (and accurately) blames my parking for the situation. Could it have been avoided? Absolutely. I would have parked down in the cul-de-sac or on the side of the road so that I could still leave early without waking someone up or having to play car musical chairs after my bedtime. Was I aware of the situation so that I could have prevented it? Absolutely not.    
Because our communication skills are so poor, when we are at home together, the tension is usually thick. Someone is usually angry at someone else for something they've done (and usually, don't even know they've done). Although we come together and eat meals and watch TV and have conversations, it's not always the most harmonious experience.    
    
One of my mom's dogs is not housebroken and often shits/pisses on the carpet outside my room, which makes the hallway smell most of the time. It's common for me to come home with a pile of shit outside my room. If the door to my room gets opened while I'm away, or if I forget to close it, there's a good chance I'll find shit/piss in my room, or that the dogs will go through my trash and leave my room a mess. Efforts to train the dog are thwarted by a lack of house-wide dedication to training rules like crating the offending dog while everyone's out of the house. 
     
I try to mostly buy my own cheap food, especially microwave lunches that I can easily bring to work, but if I store it in the kitchen it will promptly be eaten by another family member, even if I inform them that it's mine. (Three days ago... Sister: ""Can I have these noodles?"" Me: ""No, sorry, I'm saving them for a work lunch."" She eats them anyway, leaving me with no lunch the next day. Thanks sis.)     
I work very early shifts (usually starting between 3-6am) and my sister will play loud music late at night with no regard to the fact that I'm sleeping in the next room. When asked to turn off the music, she responds that ""it's my house too and we don't all have to work around your schedule."" According to that logic, I can play loud music too at 2am when I get up for work, but I wouldn't think of doing such a thing.     
She locked herself out of the house the other night while I was out and called, asking me to come unlock the door for her. I reluctantly stopped what I was doing and obliged, telling her that it might take forty-five minutes to get home from where I was in rush hour traffic, and when I got home she was gone with no explanation. ""I had to be somewhere, so I just had to leave,"" she said. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that my sister is not the most considerate person in the world.     
I cannot stand to watch the way she treats my parents. My dad recently provided her with two expense-free vacations. Two. Free. Vacations. Airfare. Hotel. Money for cabs, shows, shopping, food. With a friend, even! She receives a very generous allowance from both parents-- several hundreds of dollars a month. My mom supports her in her sports and hobbies both financially and emotionally. My mom will take time off of work to take her to the doctor when she's sick and to accompany her to competitions and whatnot. And last night my sister had the guts to call them both (and me) selfish. SELFISH? It is difficult for me not to become furious in such situations. She can call me selfish all she wants for whatever reasons she wants because I can defend myself and my actions (and yes, I'm no saint, but I feel that I'm reasonably considerate), but once she calls our parents selfish, I get very, very angry. I try to stay removed, but it is horribly difficult. All I can do is reassure my upset parents that they are not ""stupid bitches"" or ""bastard assholes"" like she accuses them of being. I would much like to tell them or even force them to take away her car or her cell phone (both paid for by my mom), or cut off her allowance (furnished by both parents), or DO SOMETHING, because I feel that her ungrateful behavior towards them is simply not acceptable. I feel that they try to make her happy and give her the world and she responds by telling them that they are horrible people. I know it's not my place to make such decisions, though. It's very frustrating.
    
The good news is that although my situation is incredibly frustrating, especially having successfully lived alone for so long, I have found ways to deal. Between work, spending time out with my boyfriend, and spending time out alone or with friends, I'm rarely home. I am always making plans and going out and doing things to avoid my house. I'm fortunate enough to own a car and be able to afford gas and small forms of entertainment like the occasional cup of coffee, a book, or a movie. Walks, jogs, tennis, hikes, and other outdoor activities are always free and enjoyable. After trying for 7 months to solve my problems (talking to my parents, trying to train the dogs, talking to my sister about expectations, etc) and getting nowhere, the next best thing I feel I can do is avoidance. I can't change it, so I stay the heck away from it.    
My boyfriend is also incredibly supportive. Despite my odd situation, he visits me frequently, which makes spending time at home easier to bear, as my sister is less likely to bother me when he's around (though she's gotten brazen lately). Without going into too much detail, he experiences a similarly undesirable yet very different living situation at his parents' home. He and I have made a promise to ourselves that, no matter what, we are both moving out by a certain date, even if it means living in our cars. This promise has driven me harder than ever before to seek out a better job. It also gives me hope that there will certainly be light at the end of the tunnel, even if that light is virtual homelessness (we both are comfortable with being homeless until we can financially get on our feet). If nothing else, being homeless will make me more appreciative of having lived at home. He is only in a slightly better financial situation than me, but he has nonetheless offered financial help from his savings should I need it. I definitely don't plan on using it, but having a safety net there should mine fail is a huge stress lifted from me. My friends and co-workers are also very supportive, and several of them have offered their couches should I be unable to fall asleep at home for whatever stupid reason. (After several nights in a row of being unable to sleep at home thanks to loud music/loud TV/etc, I nearly collapsed at work, which caused great concern among my co-workers, thus prompting the offers!) I keep telling myself that by working and trying to support myself despite the obstacles, I'm doing the right thing. I pour my efforts into work, hoping that one day it will pay off. I read tons of books and I'm learning many skills in my spare time (programming, knitting, cooking, sewing to name a few). I try to keep things positive and look at everything as a means to a better end. It is sad to see my family struggle to communicate and be unhappy because of it, but I know that moving out will remove at least one source of stress for them, and hopefully they will be able to resolve more of their own problems if they don't have to work around me living here. Little things like this keep me going every day even though I occasionally just want to submit to the frustration. Having a goal in sight and a hard deadline for change really helps the most.    
    
**tl;dr:** I have a crappy paying job and decided to move back into a poorly maintained house with my kind but passive-aggressive divorced parents and my inconsiderate teenage sister, all of whom communicate badly, leading to many problems. They take my food, are loud when I'm trying to sleep for my early shifts, and let the dogs shit everywhere. I've dealt by setting a hard deadline to move out, having a supportive boyfriend, supportive friends and supportive coworkers, and spending as much time out of the house as possible.

So, Reddit, have you ever had a living situation that was undesirable? Something that was frustrating? Uncomfortable? Unfortunate? Perhaps downright unlivable and intolerable? How did you deal with your situation? What methods did you use to overcome your problems and frustrations?

Shoddy-Note-6199,1653189676,/r/college/comments/uv2hn5/trigger_warning_22_reasons_why_i_think_psychology/,"Originally I posted this on a New Zealand sub based on my own negative experiences studying Psychology and the dire career prospects. However I really want to warn as many people as possible about the reasons not to study this major. Of course everyone can make up their own mind about what makes a good or bad major and what they should study, but I only want to give people something to think about when making a major life decision. When people start college they are probably more focused on the next 4 years but I urge you to think carefully about what you choose to study.

Here are the reasons I think Psychology is a bad major.

1. **A Bachelor by itself is worthless**. The vast majority of Psychology graduates will be trying to enter the workforce with only a Bachelor degree. This is true for many reasons, sick of study, average GPA, limited number of places in clinical psychology graduate programmes etc. Yet there is no job that needs a Bachelor degree in Psychology, so graduates are forced to compete for generic jobs that any graduate is eligible for or even require no degree at all. Straight away they are starting their career with a limited advantage despite 4 years of investment.

According to a report by Georgetown University (*The Economic Value of College Majors*) on average a STEM major earns $76,000 annually compared to a Psychology major that earns $46,000 annually. I don't know about you but I'd prefer that extra $30,000 per year.

So that is the US, what about other countries like the UK ? Well a similar picture emerges according the a 2022 report in the *Telegraph*, psychology does relative poorly with a salary of £25k after 5 years. Compare that to higher earning degrees like engineering which pays £36k on average. Of course not everyone is interested in Engineering, but many other degres such as Economics, Computing, Business, Geography, etc will typically be paying around £30k relatively early in your career. As their career progresses the gap continues to increase.

2. **Classes aren't that relevant**. Most of the classes aren't especially relevant to real life or the job market, so anything you learnt you might as well forget because it isn't that useful. Useful knowledge, such that it exists, could just as easily be picked up by reading a few books and watching a couple of free online courses on platforms like Coursera or EdX.

3. **Unexpectedly boring**. The course might seem to be interesting at the beginning, but in my opinion it gets more boring as it progresses. 


4. **Most of the material is wrong**. Much of the material you learn in your Psych degree is questionable and probably wrong. This is due to the replication crisis in psychology and other long standing issues around poorly designed research, fake data, ""publish or perish"",  etc. Why would you want to spend so much time learning incorrect material ? By some estimates more than two thirds of published studies in Psychology are wrong. It wouldn't surprise me if the true percentage is even higher ! These aren't obscure studies either, but highly cited papers published in prestigious journals. Obviously you have a big problem when the whole discipline has such dubious foundations.


5. **Getting into a clinical PhD is very competitive**. Even if you want to become a clinical Psychologist remember the number of places are extremely limited compared to the number of applicants. Are you sure your GPA will be at the level needed ? If not then maybe don't waste your time and instead do a Bachelor that offers good employment prospects from the outset.


6. **Skills are often taught at an inferior level**. Any limited skills you might acquire such as Data Analysis are at a fraction of a level of that which would be obtained doing a degree like Statistics. So if you want real skills, acquire them by doing a better major.


7. **Tuition costs are high for a relatively worthless degree**. College tuition costs keep going up and up, if instead of doing that Psychology degree you started an entry level job with opportunities for career progression you could well be financially much better off, and have even obtained some useful job market skills. At the very least you won't be starting your life with a huge amount of college debt. Many large companies no longer require a college degree.

8. **Vaguely related careers have more relevant degrees**. Some students talk up job opportunities for Psych graduates like Marketing, HR, Sales, Public Policy etc. But if you want to work in those areas a more relevant degree would be a better choice and would put you ahead when searching for jobs.

9. **Too many other graduates with the same major**. So many students do it. Even if you do acquire a few vaguely relevant skills for the job market, there are a huge number of Psych graduates graduating at the same time. Your job application won't stand out in a sea of graduates. In the 2014–15 academic year, schools in the US awarded more than 117,000 bachelor's degrees in psychology ! By some estimates the number has climbed even further to 180,000 degrees per year.

10. **Even a PhD could be worthless**. A few students go on and do a PhD in psychology (non-clinical). This is also risky since it will need a huge investment in time and money. Relatively few jobs then require a PhD in psychology. Some grads  might become Professors, but the chances are small. Even including part-time teaching positions, they are limited in number compared to the number of PhD graduates. Also the numbers are exploding, between 2004 and 2013, the number of master's degrees awarded jumped by 54 percent and doctorates by 32 percent.

11. **Be realistic about the possibilities**. I often see students making fanciful suggestions for career paths for Psychology graduates like designing Artificial Intelligence systems for Google or Apple. Sorry but those sort of jobs are for elite graduates that have specialised in AI at Stanford, MIT etc. Not people waving a Bachelor degree from an average college.


12. **Hardly anyone cares about that research**. You are unlikely to become some sort of great scientific researcher. Most of that research you work on nobody even cares about. After it's published nobody is going to even read it. I laugh at all the useless research that gets churned out every year. Don't waste your time on stuff nobody cares about. Do something more useful to society that offers a decent living.


13. **Poor starting Salary**. Psychology ranks relatively poorly for starting salaries and lifetime earnings. Look up the data yourself if you don't believe me.


14. **Vague skills and vested interests**. Most of the skills that people talk up like ""Synthesize information from diverse sources"", ""interpret and use data"", ""communicate precisely"", ""make better decisions"" can be acquired from other courses of study with better job market outcomes. Be careful of people with a vested interest talking up the job prospects. College Professors need to maintain high enrolments in the degree in order to keep their jobs. 

15. **Listen to the Graduates, not current students**. Whenever I come across a Psychology graduate who has been in the job market a few years, they tend to wish they studied something else. A study by the Wall Street Journal in 2010 found that only 26 percent of psychology majors reported being “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their career paths.
The people that defend Psychology are often Psychology undergraduates. It's probably better to not listen to career advice from people not even in the job market and who haven't had a chance to reflect on their studies.

16. **Clinical Psychology is stressful**. Even if you eventually find some sort of clinical psychology role, those jobs often can take a long-term toll on your own mental health due to the stress of dealing with people with such complex mental health issues. Ask yourself is that something you can deal with ? I applaud the hard work done by Clinical Psychologists but it isn't a job for everyone. Be realistic about whether the career is for you.

17. **The degree is unlikely to solve your own issues**. People often enrol in a Psychology degree hoping to understand their own mental issues better (such as Anxiety, Depression, ADHD etc), however studying Psychology could make those issues worse, furthermore most undergrad courses spend limited time on clinical topics. If undergrad courses had a clinical focus, then there would be nothing left to teach at grad school. Also don't think the degree will impart deep insight into human behavior or expert communication skills, it won't. It seemed like half the Psychology faculty at my college were a little nuts, so obviously their PhD didn't help that much.

18. **Consider all the options**. Some choose to defend the degree by saying they got a reasonable job, but when considering the substantial investment that is needed to acquire a degree, don't just consider one option in isolation instead look at all the possibilities and choose the one with the highest Return on Investment.

19. **How much time are you willing to spend?**. Suppose you decide to pursue the clinical psychology route, by the time you complete all the required degrees and licenses it could be 8-12 years before you practice psychology professionally. That's a long time, and Psychology doesn't have the high incomes of other fields with long training periods like Medicine.

20. **Is there a Doctor in the House?**. Sometimes people enrol in a Psychology degree hoping to get into medicine, but other degrees are far better preparation for the academic and scientific rigours of medical school as well as making it easier to get the required score on the MCAT. Yes the MCAT does have a behavioral science component, but the parts of the test that involve Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry and so forth make up a much bigger percentage.

21. **Psychology won't make you healthier**. Taking Psychology classes doesn't seem to make people healthier, by some estimates more than 1.5 million undergraduates take introductory psychology classes each year, yet college students seem to have more mental health problems than ever. When I was at college it seemed like half the students were depressed, anxious or had other issues. Reading online forums today it's extremely common for students to be struggling with mental health issues.

22. **I don't get no respect**. I'm not a person who cares too much about what other people think, but on the other hand nobody really respects an undergraduate psychology degree. Be prepared for negative comments from friends and family. Also the perception that Psychology is an easy major can count against you when looking for jobs.


Other majors are poor choices too and Psychology is likely on a par with other humanities and liberal arts majors. But Psychology in my mind is especially bad because it attracts so many students. Collectively Universities are churning out a huge number of graduates. Add together all the time and money wasted and the cost is horrendous. There are many better choices. Life is tough and students need to invest their time and money to get the best return possible.

Some people study Psychology because nothing else interests them or they just want to study something relatively easy. Maybe they don't care about finding a job or college debt, they may even have a huge trust fund. Even if that is the case think about how you might spend the next 40+ years in the workforce and what jobs you will find meaningful as well as provide a decent income. It's easy to say you don't care about money, but once those bills start falling due, having a decent income will make life less stressful.


Yes I made the mistake of doing a Psychology degree, but no I don't claim to be *traumatised* by the experience. However my fellow graduates and I agreed it was a waste of time. After doing some dead end jobs I studied Computer Science. That has its own issues, but was a vastly better investment. I made it my mission to warn people about Psychology as best I could. Of course lots of people get offended, send me hate mail etc, but at least I know I did my best to sound the alarm. Am I saying you definitely should **NEVER** study Psychology ? No !! All I'm saying is consider your options very carefully and be realistic. Unlike a Disney movie please think about not only the possible but also the probable outcomes from those choices.

If you are determined to pursue the Psychology degree at least consider a double major where your Psychology courses can be combined with something of more market value.",college,[Trigger Warning] 22 Reasons why I think Psychology is a bad major.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uv2hn5/trigger_warning_22_reasons_why_i_think_psychology/,1653211276.0,struggling with tuition,14.273333333333332
Fear0fFailure,1418596661,/r/college/comments/2pat1b/how_to_not_fail_your_classesagain/,"This is long and mostly unoriginal so unless you are desperate don't bother reading it. 

I'm seeing a lot of kids here who are worried about/have already failed some of their classes. No doubt there are many more who are reading those posts and are in the exact same situation. I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science. I don't have a 4.0 GPA. In fact, I too have failed/had to drop about 4-5 classes myself. But I've gotten things turned around and would like to help you do the same, so let's talk.

First of all, like many of the freshmen posting in here, high school was really easy for me. In fact, aside from a few classes, I would say college really hasn't been that hard either. I honestly didn't learn anything in high school. I know everyone here says that but it's especially true for me. I cheated on every single assignment in high school....like literally every one lol. Don't ask me how, but I always got the solutions manual and just copied answers (with some purposefully wrong ones thrown in so I wouldn't get caught). Then, using whatever insight I had gotten from that, I would go into the exams and make straight A's. I'm telling you this because I know how confusing it is when you then do terribly your first, second, and maybe even more semesters during college. Anyway onto the guide...


---Have you already failed? ---


Talk to the professor and ask for extra credit or if you can make anything up. Yes, on every syllabus it says not to do this or that it is pointless. Do it anyway (you have nothing to lose but your apparently misplaced pride). Most professors copy half the rules on their syllabus from another syllabus because they are lazy or the school tells them to. When I was taking calc 1, I saw that all my online homework was really hard...so I didn't do any of it. At this time, I didn't know everyone else was getting 100s on every assignment because they were using wolfram alpha. At the end of the semester, I had a D and needed a C- to pass and move onto Calc 2. My professor, let me makeup ALL my homework assignments (giving me 100s on all of them) when I completed a little ""mini test"" he made up and let me take home. It was about 10 questions long. This won't always work but every once in a while it will really save you. If you still have time to turn it around on the final, some of the upcoming study tips may help you.

---How to make sure this doesn't happen again---


1) Time and effort &gt; genius
You've probably just realized this now. Consistent work not only leads to better grades, but also leads to easier grades. Tests (even finals) will be very low stress for you if you already know you know everything...obviously. 

2) All-nighters are for college noobs
Another thing that is pretty obvious. What I am saying here though is this...if you know that you are going to cram for this test...that's fine and all but do it before you have to pull an all-nighter. If you don't know already, if you take an exam without sleep, it has been shown (by numerous studies) that you are basically taking the exam drunk. If you have to do any kind of reasoning/math/problem solving for that exam, it can (in many cases) be better to just watch some quick youtube vids of the concepts, focus as hard as you can, and go to sleep thinking about the topics instead of pulling an all-nighter. Sleep is a critical part of learning since it cements the concepts you learned that day. If the exam relies on you knowing and recalling a series of facts you wouldn't know any other way but by pure studying, an all-nighter might be necessary but this is honestly quite rare. I have not pulled an all-nighter in 2 years now. 

3) Do not take drugs to improve performance
Many people swear by study drugs but these people are fools in my opinion and everyone else deep down kind of knows it. This is sort of the same thing I did in highschool. Find an easy ""hack"" to get through an already easy curriculum then get destroyed on the next level. College is nothing important in and of itself and it is really only as hard as you make it for yourself. Rather, it is what comes after that you are preparing for and that will be the true challenge. If you still have to take drugs to do well in the work world, things will unravel quickly. Even if you made the grades, you will know that you are competing against people that made the same grades as you the legitimate way. You will know they are either geniuses, hard workers or both. That insecurity will eventually bleed out and undermine you.

That said, many people say it helps them focus on getting the work done. Of course, this can easily backfire. One of my friends took a drug that was supposed to help him focus on studying. He ended up spending hours concentrating on making a perfectly sculpted papermache penis. Another one of my friends pulled an all-nighter and took caffeine pills right before the exam. He told me that he started shaking during the exam and then threw up on the paper he was writing on. You don't want your body to experience 500mg of caffeine for the first time in its existence when you are taking a huge final. Rarely will drugs save you at the last minute from an entire semester of slacking. Trust me, you don't need them to keep up with everyone else who is using them. 

4) Go to class, even when the professor is bad
Most kids (especially freshmen), learn that one of the most joyful traps in college is that you can finally skip your classes if you feel like it. After all, you will just learn what he taught in class that day from the book, and he is a bad professor anyway with a terrible accent so it's probably better this way anyway right? EVEN IF you actually went back later that day and rigorously learned everything he taught (but lets keep it real...) it still wouldn't be worth it. Lectures are more than just a time to learn. They also provide you insight and information on the person who is going to be judging your performance. You will know how much he expects of you (or how little). You will always know what you should study before the exam (which kind of helps) and when the exam is (lol). Some professors enjoy only announcing important dates, assignments, and exam ""hints"" in class. They drink the tears of those who thought they would be a decent human being and post the same stuff on the course website. Trust me on this. Some asian guy a long time ago once said to keep your enemies closer to you than your friends. If I had actually learned history in HS I would know his name.

5) Don't ""study"" for problem solving exams
Really, it is too boring and slow to be effective. Reading your book, taking notes over the material and ""understanding it"" will work for a lot of classes but it is not the best way. On the classes it doesn't work , you will wish you had ebola so you could call in sick on the final. 

Whether you spread this out over the entire semester like a good student, or cram at the last second, you should focus on solving problems instead of reading explanations. Even if you don't know anything, go to the problem set first and begin solving it. As soon as you get stuck, go back to your resources, find what you need to know to continue, and move forward. This will naturally show you what you don't know, what you do know, and how it should be used. As students, we know that the temptation to watch netflix at the worst possible time will never leave us. However, since your mind will be more actively engaged doing this, instead of just highlighting entire chapters from your textbook, you will find it more bearable. The only willpower you will need is to get started.

Again, nothing helps you learn faster than raw application. It is tremendous practice for the exam because you are getting immediate feedback on the mistakes you are making. Thus, when you see a similar problem on the exam, you will remember the mistakes you made when you practiced the problem, and will avoid them here when it matters. That is exactly why that problem is there. The professor saw kids making mistakes on that type of problem all semester and put it there to see if they have adapted yet. With any luck, your peers will blindly stumble into these traps (while complaining they ""studied"" for the exam) and force the curve :)

6)Study a little for fact-based exams
This usually happens in your soft electives. Introduction to American History, Introduction to Art History, Introduction to Basket Weaving, Endroduction to being Interested etc. If you have to write essays make sure you actually try on them. That will give you roughly the same results as practicing with problems, since you are applying your knowledge. Otherwise, you really need to think about how the facts relate to each other and why they are important. These classes are usually easy and can help you pad your GPA. That makes it extremely important that you go to class anyway since there you will learn exactly which group of facts you need to know and in what context. This severely cuts down on study time as you won't be studying things that won't be on the exam (you know this is a big problem if you have ever skipped a lot of classes).

7) Don't rely on the curve
You can pray for rain or pay someone who claims they can bring it, but there is no guarantee it WILL rain. In very hard classes, a lot of kids will justify their poor grades by saying ""It's a hard class he will have to curve"". That may or may not be true. The reality is that even in very hard classes, there are plenty of people who are (a) geniuses (b) hard workers (c) know a guy with last years final (d) cannot afford to lose since they will be deported if they fail (e) lucky and so on. Trust me when I say that in the day of your disaster, these kids will somehow line up all the stars, come through as a group and pull off the academic equivalent of the Miracle at the Meadowlands all to your dismay. 

8) Never study in groups
Unless you find that l33t hidden study group with the 4.0 geniuses where you can l33ch like mad, this is worthless. The only function these serve is that people ""agree"" to study at a particular time for a certain duration where normally they wouldn't. Even then, you will be dealing with mostly incompetent people who either don't make themselves useful, or feed you the wrong information. Remember, in a group you can only move as fast as the slowest person. 

Unless you put together a solid team of SEALs (Super Elite Academic Lords), you will find that group study is the ultimate white kid's pipedream. How many asian gods do you know who rely on group study? Are you really going to rely on Johnny the Stoner to understand the intricacies of computing that took Alan Turing his entire life to discover? Trust me, weed isn't THAT enlightening. Even if Johnny is a theoretical comp sci God who has a diagram of a pushdown automotan as a bumper sticker on his car and swears he ""only programs in Lisp"" because he ""likes the challenge"", it still won't help you for him to basically give you his own personal solutions manual. You can't apply that now, or on an exam. If you are applying your knowledge as your professor assigns the homework assignments, and before the exam you will be completely fine without a group. This advice goes for tutors and TA's as well. Having someone help you may be necessary from time to time. But at the end of the day, it is college, and sometimes you need to just put on your bullshit boots and wade in.

sillybumbleb,1663918036,/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,"i’m a freshman in UT Austin, enrolled in a program called AET (stands for Arts and Entertainment Technologies), and it’s marketed as very flexible major depending on the career path you want to go on. the classes range from music and sound design to animation to computer science to game development. this all sounded great, because my dream is to be able to make my own indie game, and while i can take classes to help me with that i can also learn programming and how to make soundtracks so i’m not just experienced in animation, and be able to do a lot of things on my own.

i knew that it was a new major and that it began in 2017, so i was prepared for some level of disorganization as i’m sure the professors and admin still needed to figure out the classes. only being 5 weeks in, i can already tell that “disorganized” is a huge understatement when describing AET.

i went to the UT Austin subreddit to ask about the experiences of others in the major, because i was feeling really underwhelmed by my 4th week and so far the only thing they were teaching us was “mindfulness” and “interactivity”, which sounds interesting but then you start to question what this has to do with game design/animation/etc and ask the professors (i have 3 professors in my introduction to AET and 2 in my design class, and then there’s at least 3 TAs in each), and they respond with “it’ll make sense later”, it puts a lot of doubt on the ability of these professors to actually teach you something helpful. at one point they had us bring in household items and then told us to make something out of them, at the end they told us the point of the exercise was to recreate what it was like for us in preschool/elementary school where our minds were more creative.

i'm not trying to say that what they're teaching is bad, i think doing exercises like that is calming, but it's not something i want to be doing in a class i'm paying $1,000+ for, and instead could be learning something that would be useful for our careers.

essentially, the admin and professors have really no idea what they're doing. according to many other posts in the UT Austin subreddit basically exposing the AET experience, every single year it's been like this, no matter what year you're in. and now it seems that admin is pushing all of the classes towards game development and ""interactivity"" (i had to ask some upper classmen in the major what that meant, and apparently now the admin want to add focus to VR and potentially theme parks). this leaves everyone who started the major for the multiple different paths that were advertised that weren't game development being forced into something that won't help them in the future. on the outside, it sounds like that wouldn't affect me and others who are going down that path, but like i said before, even the game dev classes don't have any focus or goal.

i don't want to blame anyone, i'm trying to understand that this is a new major, and that the admin is still figuring out which direction they want it to go in. but it's leaving all of us confused since they can't give us solid reasoning and lesson plans, and end up throwing away a bunch of classes and adding new ones that no one asked for. 

the lack of passion from the professors is really getting to me. seeing them have no idea what they're supposed to be teaching isn't giving me motivation to continue, and it's even started to influence my performance in my other classes because i haven't been able to take any of them seriously. the whole reason i'm at this college is for a major that apparently doesn't have any structure, and if i'm not learning anything from it, it makes me question what's the point of trying to learn from my other classes if i'm not even there for them in the first place?

i kept holding onto hope and looked into game development as a major in general, and apparently it's a scam. a lot of indie game developers (from what i've seen) have warned students of majoring in game dev because of the way it teaches students. to sum up the big reasons: you waste your money to learn half of the whole process in 4 years instead of spending 2 years to learn how to make an entire video game, it doesn't prepare you for the industry at all and ends up leaving fresh graduates overwhelmed when they get into Nintendo or Riot because they learned how to be decent at too many things instead of being really good at a specific skill.

at this point, i was already spiraling, and after learning how the thing i was majoring in barely helps in the career path i want to go in would lead to me being in debt and with no idea what to do, made me withdraw for almost a week (still recovering from it currently), a pattern similar to many times in school.

near the end of high school, i got diagnosed with ADHD and autism because i noticed that i had been doing a lot worse in my classes. my diagnosis helped me realize that teaching myself everything wasn't normal due to the fact that i couldn't pay attention, and in the rare chance that i could i wouldn't understand anything the teacher was saying. people say that learning how to be independent in your studies in a good skill, but for me it's enforced a mindset that school just isn't for me.

a lot of people drop out because it can be very overwhelming to be learning so many things at the same time, it's hard to balance getting the hang of adulthood with a social life, and managing a job, and going to school and having to learn advanced concepts you've never heard of. hearing peoples' stories of this make me feel like i'm having the exact opposite problem where it's actually underwhelming, and i feel like i could be doing something more impactful on my life.

i'm personally doing pretty okay with the problems i've just listed out. i've never had much of a social life, and i'm okay with that because for me, being around too many people is something that is extremely overwhelming for me, and i've had a lot of public meltdowns that i have since learned to avoid by simply being comfortable in my own space and drawing or playing video games. most of my friends i've made from just working at starbucks, and my best friend of all time i met online when i was first starting my art account. i've been working since i was 16, and have experience in customer service because of my time working at barnes &amp; noble and now (as mentioned previously) starbucks, where i'm getting much better pay and a lot of benefits including free therapy. and like i said before, i've been able to earn a decent amount of money from social media by selling my art. i have almost 50k on tiktok, where my niche is that i make tarot decks inspired by my favorite games. my first deck was an Animal Crossing themed one, and i'm currently making a deck for my all time favorite game: Hollow Knight.

My only problem is school. i'm not learning anything from it, and i know it's not me having trouble with the content, it's because of all the problems i just told you about.

I've been able to learn more about how to make a game in Unity from just this past week of watching YouTube tutorials, compared to the 5 weeks i've spent in my actual game development class, where all we've learned about Unity is how to move a circle around and interact with squares.

i know having a degree is important for 90% of careers, but you don't need a degree for game development or animation to get hired by the big companies. the thing that makes you actually stand out is your portfolio. obviously, the best option is a degree and a good portfolio, as it is rare to be hired solely based on the latter, but i'm sure you would have a better chance of being hired based on a well-developed portfolio where it shows that you have a focus, compared to a degree where all you have to show is a general idea of a bunch of different things, but no real skills in something specific.

the best analogy i've heard is that you would rather have just a hammer that's sturdy and well made, than have a hammer from a hardware kit with many other tools that's not as good. sure, that kit has a bunch of things you could use in the future, but you're probably not going to use them, and if you do need a specific piece of hardware, then you'd just go out and buy a well made and sturdy version of that.

but you can basically forget that whole paragraph because i'm not even planning on going into the big industries. when you make an indie game, you don't need to show yourself that you have a degree and know how to draw, because you know that you know how to draw. marketing is more difficult outside of the big companies, but if you already have your own platform that people know, you can still get some amount of attention, all on your own. i know my platform's not very big, but games take a very long time to make and i'm sure that my account can grow by the time a game that i could make is finished.

i think the only reason i haven't dropped out yet is because everyone i've talked to about this, even after explaining my situation, basically says something along the lines of ""dropping out is bad"". and maybe they're right, but right now my gut is telling me that nothing good is going to come out of me staying here.

i should clarify: i don't mean drop out immediately once i'm sure i've gotten a green light. i'm going to stay till the ends of the semester because i already paid, and i feel bad wasting $6k, and also i still have just the smallest amount of hope that something could happen that will change my mind. emphasis on small, because i really don't think it's going to happen.

if you got this far, i appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read this, and i would love to hear your advice because i'm actually freaking out.




way TL;DR: i'm in a really shitty game dev program that i'm thinking of dropping out of because if i graduate from it, will have learned in 4 years maybe half of what i could learn in 2 of teaching myself. i have been able to make money on my own by growing my art platform on social media and working at starbucks. i'm already in the process of making my own game, i've have everything planned out and have been learning the basics of unity from tutorials online. dropping out and being on my own means i'll have more time to work at the cafe and sell my art online to earn an income while i work on my game, all without the crushing fear of debt.


P.S. before you suggest i just switch majors instead of fully dropping out, i've checked and i haven't found any majors that would suit me, but also like i was thinking of before, school probably just isn't for me.

P.S.S. if i do end up dropping out next semester, and later in life come to realize that actually i would like to go back to school, i think that would be better than having the crisis that i'm having right now for the next 4 years and then later in life realizing that i wasted a bunch of money and actually need to figure out what to do with my life or go back to school or something.",college,advice for game dev majors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,1663939636.0,can't pay for school,13.746666666666666
Edd091,1433137024,/r/college/comments/381q2y/my_full_experience_at_pensacola_christian_college/,"Well, this is it. It's been a while, but I was busy and I had to make sure that people I know graduated or finished the school year before I can post about them. Anyway, this will be a more bigger and longer post about my experience at PCC. I made a few posts, but now I will go even deeper and share some things that may cause some trouble, but like I said before, I am done with that school, and I will never go back.

WARNING- The experiences that I will share are 100% arrcuate. There will be no BS, as everything is truth. And believe me, some things I will share will be personal, and some things that could get people expelled. Yeah, I mean it. I told myself that I wasn't going to reveal the information, but what can they really do? Nothing. Besides, the only thing I will keep private is names. For obvious reasons, you all should know why. So, let's begin.

Yeah, the first day I was there, I was actually impressed. The campus is pretty big. Everything from the Crowne Center to the Dorms were pretty big. Anyway, I went in, regestired, got my schedule and went into my dorm. I won't tell you what dorm I was at, but I can tell you that the room I was in was pretty good. And the roommate I saw was a pretty cool guy as well. Yeah, it was weird at first, but then it was normal. He was a senior, so he basically knew everything about the college. So, we went to get some lunch, and let me say, at that place, you will NEVER starve. Where I went at was Four Winds, which is pretty big. They had a variety of foods from fried to vegetables. And it was a buffet, which meant that we could take as much as we wanted. All we had to do was to swpie our school I.Ds at the front, and that's it. Everyone else had to pay for it. Anyway, I went back into my dorm with the family to hang out for a while. I remember that I had a schedule on a green piece of paper, and I had to go to the Crowne Center for two things. One, to fill out paper work for the work assistance program, and two, was orentation about classes and credits. Then we walked around the school, and then my family had to leave. Yeah, it was sad, as it was my first time being without them. And it took some time for me to get used to. But I'll explain that later. Later that night, I meet another roommate that was a close friend of the other one, as he was a senior as well. He was cool, but I have a lot to share about him in a bit. Both of them, in fact. Yeah, it was the three of us at the time, soon to be four. I think it was a day or two when the other person came in. Yeah, being with three other guys in a dorm and sharing one bathroom is not as great as it seems. Anyway, on sunday, we had to get up early, dress up in a suit and tie with dress shoes. We had to shave also. Yep. We are not allowed to keep any type of hair on our face. Either we shave it off, or we had to go back and shave. Sometimes we would get demerits, which I'll explain later. I remember for sunday school, I went into the Sports Center, which by the way, is a really great place at the college. But I went to the stadium. And let me tell you how they do worship. We all get hymns, we stand up, someone goes up and leads the group with their hand, conducting it like a choir. At first I didn't mind. But the more they did it, the more it was getting more ridicolous. Anyway, I think it was St. Clair. Yeah, I think he was a PCC Golden boy, as they would call it at the school. Then, we got a welcome, a message, and then we went to the Crowne Center. And let me say, that place is freaking big. It can hold up to thousands of people. I remember sitting at the top, and while everybody was talking, the church band would go up to the front, and play some classical chruch music. Then the chior would come up, dressed in green and white. That's what happened for a bit. Then, someone came up, who I thought was a Horton, but wasn't. He came up, said hi to everyone, and told everyone to turn to their hymn books to a song, and you know what he did, he did the exact same thing. He raised his hand up like he was conducting a chior, and leading everyone to the song. Yeah, at first I was ok with it, but then it got too repetitive, as I stated at my other post. It feels like they were forced to sing, and not singing unto God. As I looked and observed throughout the semester, it seems as people were just doing it as a hobbie, and not really singing it from the heart. Oh yeah, the broadcasted it around the internet, so they had to look good. It almost felt as if it were scripted. Anyway, after that was done, the president, Dr. Shoemaker, introduced himself to everyone. I can say that he really does care about the students, as I feel he was one of the few who actually did. Oh yeah, most of the the admistration would come up once in a while and smile and say some words, but when I see them up close walking by, they really don't care. Let me share a good example. A guy named Mr. Ashmore, is one of those people who conduct the whole church from time to time during church services. Anyway, Sometimes he works at the information desk, and he happened to be there one time and I needed to ask him something about chapel, since I was working during that time. I didn't know what to do, so I figured I'd ask him, and he would help out. HA! In a rude way, he said that I should've discussed that with my supervisor. Wait. I have NEVER been to this school, and not even a month, and that's how you treat people? Like they are nothing with no respect? Yeah, this guy was a phony. He acted like I was stupid. Yeah, so you smile up there for the camera, but you act so unprofessional in real life. That's fine. Yeah, that's the love you keep talking about when you sing those songs to eveyone. Just pathetic. Yeah, him and a few other staff memebers I've encountered with their rude behavior. I'll discuss that later. Anyway, let me talk about the work assistance and where I worked at. Yes, I will tell you where I worked, but not the location. Where I worked at was the PCC Print Shop. Oh man to I have a lot to share about that. For one, It was a walking distance from my dorm. And, I had to wake up super early in the morning. And between the school and the Shop was the gate. Yeah, they had a big gate across the campus. And yeah, we had to use our I.D cards to scan and go through. We then had to walk another mile just to get there. Then, we had to cross a sidewalk, just to get to the entrance. When we got in, the place really is a Print Shop. it was huge. Anyway, we meet our bosses, they showed us around, just for the first day. But after that, we got straight to work. And let me tell you, they don't play about that. In fact, for the dress code, we had to wear school appropriate clothing with our shirt tucked in, which doesn't make any sense to me. Why couldn't we just get a uniform from the shop? We work for hours and by the time we are done, we are sweating and tired, plus we have to walk all the way back! I mean it was just hard. Oh yeah, we had to shave too, or else we had to clock out, go back to our dorm, shave, and go straight back to work. It didn't happen to me, but I'm sure people weren't going to waste that time just for one little thing. If it happened to me, then I would just leave and never come back for the rest of the shift. Oh, something else funny. There is no internet acess at all. They block everything so that we don't make phone calls or stuff like that. The only people who had acess was the bosses. To me, I think that's a little parinod. Who would go that far just to make a point, oh this school would. But yeah, working there was rough because right after the bell rang, I had to go like crazy. I had to go ALL the way back and change in under an hour, with not enough time to eat. Sometimes I had to skip lunch and go to class hungry and tired. In fact, sometimes I just skipped class, because I was just too tired. I mean, I didn't know about any of this when I signed up, and I even read everything! It's not as it seems there. Oh yeah, the pay is just pointless. It's like pocket change compared to that 1800 or 1900 bill you have to pay. How the heck can someone work so hard and be paid just miminum wage? I mean, the president alone spends so much money for the school, like paying for a huge christmas tree at the commons, changing the commons completly, giving students 10 dollars free on the I.D to buy something at the Palms Grille, or hiring professional bike stunt people for a show at the turkey bowl, or renting a helicopter just to land on the field, I mean I could go on, but you see my point. Why spend money on the college for all these things? I mean, I know he's trying to make the college a better place, but can't he use it for other things? Things the students actually need, especially finically? I know there's schlorships and loans, and even the work contract, but those are really hard to get. There's just so much competition. They say the college is cheap, but in reality and from personal experience, it's just too expensinve. Those are my thoughts on that.

Moving on, let me share about the classes. Yeah, as I said on my other post, it's based on christian principles. And that, I had no problem with. But juggling work and classes, it was just too much for me. And yeah, if I was just tired, I'd just skip the class and sleep at the dorm. Hey, it was better than sleeping in class, which you can get in trouble for. The teachers, the ones I had were good. I had no problems most of them. Some teacher, however, were fresh out of graduating and just started teaching. And let me say, some of them don't know how to handle a class. It's like they try so hard, and yet I noticed that they get pissed off so quickly. Yeah, and some of the classes were people who were fresh out of high school. So yeah, they still acted like children. But yeah, nothing more on that. Now, Let me talk about the ""DORM LIFE"".

Now, for those who read this are from the school, read my warning, because I've already warned you.

Crock-A-Gator,1646198131,/r/college/comments/t4simt/i_feel_behind_and_lost/,"  

So, to start, I want to get some initial information out there. I graduated high school in 2019 at the age of 17. I am **M\\20**, now in my 6th semester of college as a ""junior"". But basically, where a freshman would be at. 

I feel like I have made so many mistakes when it has come to schooling. Too many to count. Highschool I never tried, didn't care, didn't study, and overall didn't do anything that wasn't required to do. And sometimes not even that. I didn't try to learn, for example, never tried in math at all (which will come up later), cheated on what schoolwork I was able to cheat on, and relied on everyone else to do the work for me. In fact, I think I did homework in high school a total of 5-10 times max. I specifically remember a PLTW class that I did not do a single thing the entire semester/year however long the class was. It was group-based, and I was paired with some good friends who were smart ash and tried hard in school (I will mention these two again later). All in all, I did not set myself up with a good work ethic or study habits. And I especially didn't set myself up with good grades to aid in college at all. Speaking of college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Our school counselors in high school as well as my parents PUSHED me extremely hard to go into a community college because of the A+ program and how I could ""save SO MUCH money"", and just ""go into college with an associate degree and be right where you would have been anyways"". And to clear it up my dad did not go to college; my mom went and got a BSAD degree, and they were both extremely uninterested in helping me with anything to do in college. Or really with life. They were busy getting divorced and running a couple separate businesses that didn’t do to hot for our family life. Which (at the time) was 100% okay with me because I just didn't want to worry about college and didn't care. They just seemed to let me figure it out myself which is still the case and has been the case for the last couple of years since I have been in college. Didn't talk about degrees, ideas, pros, and cons, universities, or literally anything at all with anything to do about college. I did all my financial aid alone, like figuring out payments, classes, tours of school and anything else you could think of that goes into college. I think they just thought it was an easy way to go and ""saved money"" which was fine with them for some reason even though they aren't paying for any schooling. 

This brings me to my first transition going to college. My first semester was GREAT. Easy classes still didn't know what I wanted to do, just kind of riding the wave and commuting with a different group of friends from high school, and all ended up getting very close. Taking just normal general education classes like English, writing, math, college success class, and a computer applications class. I still cheated and hardly tried, did about as little as I could still. (I got caught plagiarizing in my writing class and my prof. pulled up the exact article I copied from in class and read it out loud coincidentally. When he saw my paper, he knew what I did. Anyways, some of those classes were a joke. I was fine with the grades I was getting even though some classes were 'pass/fail' and didn't count as any credits like 'pre-algebra' and 'developmental writing'. I didn't take any math I didn't HAVE to take in high school as I said earlier, and it fucked me because I had to take every single math class from the ground up at the most basic level starting at pre-algebra.

I feel like I am rambling on and on and on, so anyways I end up going for four more semesters (5 in total) at this same college and kind of doing the same thing honestly. It is embarrassing to say but I did, I cheated when I could, didn't study, and cared more but not as much as a successful college student should. This community college and airhead advisors had me taking every single general education under the sun I ended up with about 59 earned credits after 5 semesters. And by this time, I had decided I wanted to major in computer science. I thought because I like computers, video games, and technology this would be a great choice. Plus, some good friends (high school PLTW friends) were going into engineering, so STEM sounded great. I did not realize anything this entailed or how bad I fucked up in school and in that community college. The last math class I completed was college algebra and that was one of the classes during covid and I cheated 100% the entire thing. I tried to study but would get frustrated and just quit then cheat and get through it. Come to find out comp sci goes to calc three, plus stats, and discrete math. That was and is the least of my worries now though. 

**Also, important note here** \- I feel like I focused a lot on the cheating aspect and unmotivated aspect. In all reality, it doesn't matter or feel like it matters that much I cheated on history and different classes like that. I didn't or don't need them in my degree and I could care less about it. I could wrap my head wasting so much time over learning about stuff that doesn't interest me and isn't going to help at all with anything. I am not trying to defend it. That was just my reasoning. Math obviously is a different story. Maybe I am wrong and that conditioned me to do things wrong, I whole heartly don’t know. 

Once I got to my 5th semester at that community college, I already knew I ""wanted"" to major in comp sci as I said. I didn't even get an associate degree in computer science or any kind for that matter after that last semester. But I didn't think it was going to be a big deal as I was told by friends and some other people it would really matter that much while transferring. The advisors did say it might be harder to transfer credits but after everything they made me do and how much I hated it at that community college, I didn't care what happened. Big mistake. And by this point in my life, I was looking down a direction and for the first-time kind of getting excited about knowing where I wanted to go and how I was going to get there no matter how hard it is with a degree in comp sci. Hopefully figuring out my life, doing something productive and meaningful. I was proud to say I am transferring to this university to study computer science. Then I was told by the university I was transferring to that almost none of my credits will be able to be transferred because of equivalency from course to course. At first, I was destroyed. They told me I basically have 4 years left and I am going to have to start from the beginning. 3 days after I heard that I was still just devastated, I thought those 2.5 years were wasted. But I switched advisors and my new advisor told me we can figure something out and see what is going on. Basically, I took WAY too many general education classes and not degree-specific classes at my community college, as well as not getting an associate degree so really nothing transferred or was equivalent to any courses. And for some reason, idiot me got my hopes up on our university's degree audit page and it says that I have 55 credits that have been transferred, 12 in progress, and 53 credits to go until I get a bachelor's degree. I have no idea why I didn't put this all in my head but those are just classes that did transfer over to the school but no matter what in any degree I run an audit on its all about 3 years minimum. So, I was going through all these emotions, from thinking I have 3 years, then to “alright I only have 2 years like I should”, to then again back to realizing I have even more time than I thought. 

So after, now this semester. I realized that I have close to 100 credits or about 3.5 years until I get any degree almost at all. Because hardly any classes from my community college transfer over as any sort of degree specific requirements. I hate computer science I am sick of it; I can't do math(pre-calc) to save my life, I have terrible study habits, and can't seem to get motivated although I truly want to. I truly want to do better. I was just coasting through the community college. And although I was cheating, I felt like I was turning it around and getting smarter and doing better last 2 semesters ago and especially last semester and was ready to come to a new school and try hard and make leeway on a degree. Now I failed both exams on the two most important classes I have, want to switch degrees, watching my friends from high school who tried and work hard (they happen to be my best friends) pass me up and go on and about to graduate with engineering degrees, while I am stuck basically at freshman-level courses I can’t pass. 

I just feel like a failure, I feel lost and so confused. I don't feel like I am smart enough for school, I don't feel like I have the study habits it takes, I don't even know if I want to go through with another 3-to 4 years of schooling.

Even after all this typing which is the longest post I have ever posted by far, I think I did a terrible job summing it up and explaining. In my mind, this feels like 5% of my thoughts. I talked down on myself about a lot of different things, I don't think I did everything wrong. I had an internship last summer for computer science, and another one this summer with a company that is supposed to be one of the ""top 100 internship programs in the country"". But all in all, I am so far behind in college it just kills me, I wish I did stuff differently, I wish I instilled a better work ethic and study habits when I was younger, I wish I had more support. I am trying to turn it around I just have no idea how at all. Everyone can make excuses about everything if they don't succeed, I don't want to seem like the type to complain about everything. I just feel like I did A LOT of stuff wrong ALOT of different times, as well as getting a couple of iffy hands in this confusing game of poker we call life :/

**I hope everyone reading this can truly smile, wake up and say with 100% honesty that they are happy. That is true success.** And I hope to be successful one day. I need to remember this too, **“everything will be okay”**. I know I wasn’t the best person, student, friend, brother, employee, boyfriend, or anything in my life but I just hope and pay everything will be okay.

ihadabadday,1269928682,/r/AskReddit/comments/bk19b/i_had_a_bad_day_would_you_like_to_sort_it_out_for/,"Hi Reddit community, 
this is a throwaway account. I have been a member since more than a year by now and I never felt so bad in my life.

I'm 26, I broke up in october with my ex-gf for 3 years. In Jan I went to a convention and I met a really pretty girl, there to represent her company. I gave her my number but I was convinced that I could meet her again during the 3 days of the convention. I didn't.
I got back to my city (NY) and I just kept chatting with her, only workrelated.
One day we chatted a bit more. This time she is answering right away and we finally chat for good: we find out we have so many things in common. I gave her again my number and she gave me hers. We kept the conversation via text and at the end SHE told me we should meet ""to discuss movies"". 
By this point, I just remembered she was pretty, nothing more. 
On the follow friday she tells me she was in Manhattan (she lives in Queens), out with friends. I was out with a friend and we decided to join. Long story short, we ended up spending all night(till the bar closed) with her on my side and knowing each other.
As soon as we saparated, she sent me a text saying to do it again.
Saturday she was tired. On sunday, out of the blue, she tells me she is in the city with a friend (at 2 pm). I just tell her that if she wants to meet, I'd be free. 
We ended up with her coming to my place to drop the shopping bags (including a facemask, stored in the fridge...), drinking a beer, taking my two dogs out to central park, walking and laughing for two hours, eating out at an outside sushi (with the dogs), walking back to my place, drop the dog, drinking other few beers in a bar and watching a movie in the theater!
From what was supposed to be a short meeting, ended up being a 12 hour long date. No one of us pushed, I could feel we were both surprised of how well the day was passing.
She gets a cab and then she calls me, maliciously telling me she forgot her facemask. I take the chance and I told her that is she wanted it, we had to meet again. She agreed! 

monday: we chat a bit at work. She tells me that she wants to wait and don't rush things because she just met me, etc etc. I totally agree, telling her just that I liked the days we had and I'd like to have more of them. Nothing more, nothing less. She agrees and also agree on meeting Thursday. When she was over, she surprised me with a call. We spoke a bit. In the evening we texted witty and then goodnight.

Tuesday: she really loves her job and cares about it. And it's though for her because it's a man-only field. Yet, she sent me a message (""I'm crying at work""). I felt horrible, i wanted to help her but i was stuck in school.
I manage to text her and comfort her a bit. When she finishes the job, she called me right away (2 mins later) and we had a hone our long conversation, with she ""breaking down"" about the job, of why she cried etc. I want to think that I helped her. I'm pretty much sure i did.

Wed: at 9 pm i called her. We had a brief conversation and she told me she had to call me back soon. I waited but she didn't. So at 11:30 pm I was about to get pissed but she surprised me with a text: ""Sorry i felt asleep! Wanna talk now?""
I called her and we spent 40 minutes talking about everything, discovering each other in the process. She had a sleepy voice and I could tell that, with the passing of the time, her voice was sleepier and sleepier. I told her and I basically ""put her to bed"". It was almost romantic, and she knew it and felt it.

Thu: the day of the second date. I prepare everything: cut my hair, clean the house (loooong process), wash the dogs, wash me, buy food, buy expensive white wine, buy second wine in case the first is a bad choice, start to cook, wait...
The idea was to cook her a nice meal (to show her I can do something for her, not just buy it..), then head out to bowling+drinks or pool+drinks. I told her i didn't want to make her feel like i wanted to spend the night at my place just to fuck her.
She arrived and we had dinner. She enjoyed it. We start to talk about pretty much everything and then we reach the ""What are we?"" dialog. She stops me, telling me again she just want to wait etc. I use it as an excuse to ""joke"" on the fact that she is not even giving me a chance. She just said that she never said she is not giving a chance...
We spent the night in my place at the end, on her choice. We got drunk and we just didn't feel like going out. I could make a move at this point, and I would have probably even succeded, but I felt it wrong. I would have abused of her, and that's not what i want. I really feel something for this girl and I don't want just to fuck her.
I took a cab with her to bring her back to her place because she was too drunk. In the cab she explains me (after me pushing about it) the real situation: she doesn't want anyone now. She spent the last years always in a serious relationship and now she just want to be alone to discover herself. I know, it sound like the usual bullshit girls say, but I understood she meant it. I walk her to her house and she spent some time finding the keys, then talking a bit, etc. I know that the dating-book says that I should have kissed her then, but it sounded again as wrong. I knew she would have taken the kiss (drunk horniness?) but it would have been wrong after what she said.
She opens the door, salutes me with the two chick-kisses and then we just stare at each other for 5 seconds. Again, dating-book 101. I was also drunk...

Friday: no meeting, just a bit textin.
Saturday: I remembered (I was drunk...) that on Thu she told me to listen to the song she put on the stereo: ""Skinny Love"" by Bon Iver, pointing at the ""I told you to be patient"" line. I looked for the lyrics and started to make a sense of it. Did she meant only that or the whole meaning? Is she actually over her ex?
She calls me. I knew she had a farewell party to go to and we coudlnt' meet. On the phone I asked her about the song and, more directly, ""are you over your ex?"". Answer: ""I think so, yes"". Then, after 2 mins of talking about other subjects, and telling me she would be in the city the day after, she told me she had to go and she would call me later. She never did. All night. I tried to call her from internet (no number) and she wasn't really answering. Strange, she is really always close to her phone..
I freak out but I don't write anything, fortunately. 
In the meanwhile, I discover that my dog in italy, Birba, a 14 yr old poodle, is now really sick. Nice..

Sunday: we were supposed to meet (didn't plan it, but just suggested it) but she still didn't answer. At 4, she texts me that her phone died, she was sorry and she was feeling sick after the night, so we wouldn't meet.
I asked her if everything was fine and she told me that I asked her those weird questions and that's why she closed the phone. She didn't want to think about that on the farewell party. Fair enough , I excuse myself and she ends the conversation with a ""good night"" (at 5.30 pm...). Few ours later she texts me saying that she hopes my dog feels better...

I knew was the last night of Birba. She was too weak. So i knew today would have been a bad day. I wasn't wrong.

Today:
I wake up, call home in italy and ... Birba had to be put down, and died few ours before. I close the phone and start sobbing. I wrote her ""Birba died"" and she answered right away, trying to cheer me up.
Later, hell broke loose.
During the day she texts me about a job offer she had in LA. I sweetly tell her that she can't go away... She answer me: ""Will talk"" and then ""No way I'm moving"". It sounded like she was also being ""malicious with me"".
At 6 pm, I answer her text she left in a chat (i was out). 
She was asking if she could still take the offer i gave her to teach her HTML+PHP (Nerd power...). I smoothly told her ""If that's what it takes to see you, yeah :)""
From that point she started to say that we are not on the same page, because i should make any plan on her since she doesn't want ANYONE, she doesn't want any ties, specially not during this summer, even if she consider me a ""cool guy"" and ""we get along well"". So, she basically closed everything (this closing ""chat"" was 30 minute long, we went back and forth on the subject a lot. It wasn't just ONE text, that's what i mean).
Out of resources, I told her that, since we are just friends (as she asked, by respecting her ""don't want anyone""), ""I was still up for the lessons, if you want"". She answered only with a ""Ok"".

So, now I'm here, crying about my dog, my friends (i called them with ""some shit happened, i need to drink"") are now gone, and the girl i really found different, sexy, interesting, compatible, funny, lovely is now not an option anymore.
I know I threw myself too fast into this ""relationship"" but that's only because I needed it. I needed/need to feel love again. And, objectively, I would have ""felt in love"" with this girl even in another time. I know she is a really great match, a probable serious and long relationship. I know also she felt the same.
And we are now wasting it... GRRRRRRR

The question is now: out of a stupid romantic moment, today (before the storm) i ordered flower to be delivered tomorrow at her workplace. The initial idea was to send her a bucket of flowers every week anonymously (only a smily face on the card), until we eventually would have kissed. Then, I would have sent a nice bucket with a sentence about our ""kissing night"" so she would understand it was me.

Now, i have the option to:
A) Stop the flowers. Wasting almost 100 bucks and that's it.
B) remove the smily face and just send them with no card and deny i sent them (in case she asks)
C) change the card with something else.
D) leave them this way.

childbear,1347587512,/r/AskReddit/comments/zusf8/im_pretty_sure_my_boss_is_screwing_me_and_i_dont/,"Okay - excuse the novel of details, but I feel like this is all really complicated and I need to explain everything for it to make sense.

So I worked all last year as a classroom assistant at a one-room primary (preschool &amp; kindergarten) montessori school. Because there are so many montessori schools and a lot of them have ridiculous names, lets call this one Guacamole Montessori. 

Guacamole Montessori was started by a woman - let's call her Mary - who has 20 years of teaching experience; 10 or so in Montessori. 7 years ago she was approached by a family who wanted to sponsor her to start her own primary school. It's not uncommon for primary montessori schools to be ""children's houses"" - and that's what Guacamole montessori became. Mary and her family live on the second floor of a nice house and the school exists on the first floor.

When I was hired in October of 2011, I didn't have training. I didn't have any experience in montessori. Retrospectively, I was so unqualified that I don't think she should have even hired me. But thats beside the point. Mary hired me to replace her previous assistant who was leaving to have a baby, and I was desperate for employment.

Typically, a classroom assistant is supposed to observe the classroom and facilitate concentration and learning. Mary obviously thought she could teach me how to do this while still maintaining an environment in which the children could learn.

I did my best, but eventually my role became the person she directed around the classroom. She didn't let me make any decisions about how to conduct myself and often yelled across the room - braking the fragile concentration of preschoolers - just to tell me something I already knew. 

Because Guacamole Montessori and Mary's house were the same place, my job began incorporating managing other aspects of her personal life. I walked her daughter to and from school every day. Did the dishes daily. She sent me almost daily to Starbucks to get her scones. She doesn't know how to operate a computer (im not even kidding) and she would have me manage her emails for her. It was my job to make sure her daughter was ready for ballet every afternoon. Occasionally (one a week or so) I did her personal laundry and started dinner for her family. A few times she even asked me to discipline her daughters for her.

Mary would also provide misinformation (lie) about me parents, presumably to make me look better? I have no idea. Example: I told her I was interested in volunteering in a hospital this summer and she announced in front of all the parents at the end of school brunch that I had decided to become a pediatrician. 

For a while, I went back and forth about whether I wanted to get my montessori training and become a teacher, but I always settled on no. By the end of the year, I was more than eager to GTFO and not see Mary until September.

When I was hired, Mary told me she would give me a raise (my starting salary was $10.50/hr) within a few months of October 2011, and that she would give me a summer bonus for committing to work the 2012-2013 school year. Being a broke 24 year old girl, I totally committed to working the next school year, hoping that I might find something better before the school year started. But when I approached Mary in June about giving me a raise the next year and the bonus (both of which she never mentioned after my hiring interview), she told me she could do neither because enrollment was so down. She assured me she would do open houses all summer and we could talk about it again at the beginning of the year.

So August approached and Mary called me in for a meeting - just a few weeks before school was to begin. Mary told me she didn't get a single student to enroll; we had 7 students for the whole year  - as opposed to the 14 we had last year (the intended class size for the school). Mary told me she couldn't hire me back full time, and instead could offer me 15/hrs a week.

**Here's where it gets confusing to me**

Mary told me then that she wanted to hire me as an independent contractor **(I still have no idea what this means)**. She told me she still had to pay taxes (but not my social security, right?) but by hiring me as an independent contractor, she didn't have to pay unemployment insurance because she would no longer have the right to fire me. She told me that I would no longer be her employee and we would be ""two adults working together in the same environment."" I remember that quote so well because I was so surprised. She never treated me like an adult. 

So Mary explained that my job would be 3 hours a day and I would not be in the classroom at all. She said my only job would be to manage the school garden and give gardening lessons for half the time and during the other half I would give baking lessons. I was kind of pumped when I heard this, because I really hated working in the classroom with her and getting bossed around instead of her trusting I could - after months of her direction - make something close to a wise decision in the classroom. She told me I would have total freedom in the garden with the understanding that we could use one element from the garden to cook with each week.

But when school started last week, nothing was how she explained. She had me doing odd-jobs for her right away. Writing emails, going into her daughter's room and using the printer to print out the parent handbook in which she had **a)** written my bio (falsely) and **b)** listed me as ""assistant to the directress."" 

Last week, when we talked about my daily schedule, she gave me (of three hours) 45 minutes of gardening lessons with kids and **10 minutes** by myself to manage the garden. Now god bless these kids, but theres no way they can even effectively plant a plant let alone assist me on keeping the garden fruitful. 10 minutes is a laughable amount of time for me to do all the watering, weeding, and pruning that needs to get done. Let alone her unrealistic expectations for making another raised bed. At this rate, we will never fulfill the expectation of eating from our garden once a week, and she will just get mad at me again. She also clearly has no faith that I can do my job (and it should be said that I have experience in gardening). While I am in their presence, she says to parents ""(Me) needs help planning the garden,"" or ""(Me) needs advice on how to get rid of slugs,"" etc. etc. ""NO. I actually don't,"" I want to scream.

Next she factored in 30 minutes of my schedule for baking and that left 95 extra minutes. I was shocked that she told me she wanted to make that time general odd-job time. She told me matter-of-factly that she ""needed help"" and that, in addition to whatever little tasks she has for me to do each day, I should be prepared to make and set up art projects, clean the kitchen, assist with outdoor playtime.

She told me she wanted this schedule to be rigid. 8:45 - 8:55, prepare the garden. 8:55 - 9:40, gardening lessons, etc. But last week she made it clear she didn't give a fuck. She had me cleaning up for her until 9:40, I asked her what I should do if she wants me to honor the schedule but also wants me to do shit for her. She got so angry she asked me if I even wanted to work that day. Yes. I did. I don't want to work there on a larger level, but I wanted to work there that day because I need the money. Every day we don't follow the schedule and every day she gets frustrated. And I do too, because I have no idea what she expects of me, and no idea how to stand up for myself in front of her.

I am not an independent contractor. I am her employee. I am her little slave girl. This week she referred to me as though I was a child in front of all the students and today, when she left me alone with them to take a personal phone call, they would not listen to me and did not honor me as an authority figure, because they learned not to from her behavior. (She also kept me 30 minutes late as she was talking and I was late to my meeting with my career counselor. Oh, the irony.)

The more I've started looking for things, the more I've noticed funny signs that things are not right at the school. Here is a list of things I've come up with: 

**1.** I have not signed a damned thing. Neither she nor I have written a contract for this. Given, I am young and have never done this before, and I have no idea what I'm doing (why I'm asking reddit), but does't being an independent *contractor* require a *contract*? Also, doesn't that mean I have to pay double taxes or something?
**2.** I asked Mary when I was getting paid. After convincing her NOT to decrease my pay-rate this year (she wanted to take it down $.50/hr), Mary told me she would pay me monthly on the 15th. So when I asked her if she would pay me Sept. 15 for the month of September, she said ""I don't know, probably not. I haven't yet received all of the tuition checks."" As if that were my problem, right?
**3.** Tuition checks are made out to Mary, and not to Guacamole Montessori.
**4.** When Mary gave me the school's card to go buy garden supplies at the nursery, the name on the card was not Guacamole or Mary; it was her husbands name .. ? Does she no separate Guacamole's money from her own personal money?
**5.** This week the state inspector came (as she does annually) and Mary had me running around frantically to make safety things up to date. She had me updating emergency kits (every kid has one) that clearly had not been updated since the year before last. It was also clear that much safety and hygiene protocol has been ignored until the inspector's visit.

**Something is not right here and I don't know what to do.** Mary is unprofessional and degrading, and I don't think she even knows it. I'm afraid if I confront her about these issues she will fire me and find someone else and I can't afford to lose my job, no matter how shitty it is.

I am working with a career counselor who, in the coming weeks, will help me build a plan to get out of this job and find another ""survival job"" that will just help me with money until I figure out what my true calling is. But in the meantime, **I need to know how to cope with this horrible work environment.** 

**Please, any advice is appreciated. Even explaining what a business relationship with an  independent contractor should look like would be extremely helpful.**

**TL/DR** I was hired as an independent contractor, have never signed a contract, am being treated like an underling.

Edd091,1429985581,/r/college/comments/33ua3n/as_a_former_student_at_pensacola_christian_college/,"Yes. I did go to Pensacola Christian College. After my experience of one semester there, I will never go back. And since I don't go there  anymore, I figured I might as well share my experience of what really goes on from the inside.

When I first arrived there, it was big. . It's pretty big for a christian college. Anyway, the first few days were basically registration and getting things in order. Not to also mention a church service every night until classes began. But I'll discuss that in a little bit. 

Anyway, the first thing I want to share with you is there "" Work Assistance"" program. You can go to this link- http://www.pcci.edu/financialinfo/workassistance.aspx

It will tell you about the ""wonderful opportunities"" they have and Student Testimonies about how they got through college just by working there. Guys, it's all a scam. It's not going to help pay for even less that HALF of your tuition. As a student working there, they pay less than 25% of your tuition, and you have to pay the rest yourself. Yes, they pay minimum wage for hard labor and work to students who are in deep financial need. I won't tell you where i worked at, since I'm going to remain anonymous, but I can tell you that where I worked at, they treat you like they would in the real world. Crap. You get to work. And let me tell you, I almost didn't make it. I was telling myself it wasn't worth waking up early to do this job, and then have to go to classes with barely enough time to shower and get something to eat. Then I had to do the make-up chapel service, since I was one of many students who had to work. If we didn't, then we would get demerits. To sum it up, it sucked big time.



Classes, they were OK. I really didn't have a problem with it at the start. Aside from the christian principles they had, It was fine with  me. Most teachers there are very smart and wise. They seem to know what they were doing. Some teachers, however, were new grads and they didn't have a clue on how to run a class. That's all I'm going to say about that.

Chapel is pretty much just like Campus Church. Only it's shorter, with announcements. Yep. We pretty much had Church everyday except for Wednesdays, which we had night service. Sometimes Chapel can be fun, but most of the time it was just like church.

Church services on Wednesday night and Sunday was like attending a funeral almost every time. It's too repetitive. When we go in, the church band would play the same thing over and over again. Then someone would come up, and conduct the church body like a choir with his hand. It was silly, and it still is. There's no real worship, no emotion. It seems like a job they wanted to do just to get over with. They looked like they were happy to be there, but I wondered if they just wanted to go home. And most of the time as I observed it, most people really didn't want to be there as well. The only thing that seem excited by the student body is the fact that they can sit next to each other. That's one of the only freedom the students had and they didn't take advantage of that. I remember groups of 20 people going into a row of two, just to sit together. Most didn't care about church, as I've observed. They just wanted to socialize. And at the same time, they looked like they wanted to go leave as well. But we didn't have a choice. We were forced to go to Church. Sometimes we would have special guests, but most of the time it was either Pastor McBride, or Mullenix. Mullenix is someone who would put many, many people to sleep as I observed. He put me to sleep sometimes as well. Yes, he does speak on important topics, but the way he does it doesn't make it effective. I even asked one of my friends if he was ever like this and they told me that you will get used to it. I never did, so whenever he speaks, I just didn't care. Even I just wanted to go to bed. Pastor McBride was cool. Everybody pretty much likes him. But I feel that there's only so much he can do as a pastor, since the system controls what he can and can't do. One more thing. We had to dress up for every service. We couldn't leave the halls without someone spotting you for wearing the wrong thing. To me, they feel like dressing up makes you better than everyone else in the world.

Residence hall life. Now, since I was older, it really wasn't much of a problem. Yeah, we had floor leaders, but they were cool. As far as my roommates go, I can't reveal much information as I want to keep them anonymous as well. But what I can say is that for myself, I didn't care about the rules after a while. For instance, they are tight on no headphones. At first I complied, but after making some friends who knew the system and broke that rule, I bought headphones and listened to anything I wanted. I was careful about where to use them and didn't get caught. Even when I walked off campus sometimes, I would slip them on and listen to my music. Oh yeah, the music rules. You can read it here- https://www.pcci.edu/pathway/StudentResponsibilities/CollegeStandards2.aspx

Yeah. They are tight about that as well. But, from what I learned, most of my friends listened to music that wasn't allowed. I even had incidents where I would walk into one of my friends rooms and they would be listening to artists like Imagine Dragons, or Bruno Mars. So, I did the same. Even for movies. I would go to an undisclosed location and use the internet to get movies or TV shows that I missed. To sum it all up, you can beat the system, but you have to be careful. Fortunate for me, I never got caught because I was. 

Dress code. It wasn't a problem for me, but they are strict on what you wear. They want you to be an example as a christian and to the world. In fact, you can read everything here- https://www.pcci.edu/pathway/

The segregation of males and females. Yes, they are serious about that as well. When I was there, most people told me that things changed, but some things stayed the same. There's a separate elevator and stairwell so that we can't walk together. There's no dating, unless we are older. At the commons they would watch people who are sitting together. There's no touching or hugging, which I've done a few times and didn't get caught. But it seems to me that people do it anyway, if they are careful. I heard a story from one of my friends that a guy and a girl had sex on campus and got caught by a security guard. Yes, they got expelled, but because of what the college stands for, that's why people do what they want. They love to enforce the rules, that it gets to a point where people just don't care anymore and do what they want. I knew people who were there for a few years and I was surprised at what they did. Some people make those choices, and whatever happens, it's on them.

The food there is good until it gets to the point where it gets sick to your stomach. That's all I'm going to say about that.

The Student Court is just ridiculous. You have to check on your computer to see if you have to go to student court. If you do, you have to wait in a long line full of students who most of them are there for no apparent reason. For example, since I was working, I couldn't go to some events. They actually have attendance cards that you have to give when you go in. If you don't, then you have to go to student court. Then you have to waste your time and tell whosoever ""judging"" you that you are working. Then you are on your merry way. I had to tell my boss that I was getting these notices and they should know that I was working. So they had to actually tell the office that I was working, and yet again I had to go down there again! Seriously...


But one thing bothered me a lot even before going to the college was that they really don't care about victims of rape. You can read the story here- http://www.xojane.com/issues/samantha-field-pensacola-christian-college-rape-stalking

After what I read, I couldn't believe that a christian college who claimed to be caring would expel people because they were in a situation that they had no control of. As I read more stories of the victim, and the more time I was on the campus, I was beginning to understand that the administration has no heart. They only care about enforcing the rules, no matter what. They stick to their code, and get a paycheck at the end of the day. They don't have compassion and reach out their hand, like Jesus would and comfort them. They don't want the police involved because obviously they are a private school and don't want to ruin their reputation. They brush them off like dirt and take their money.  And then the people who are responsible for doing it walk away with a degree.It's just sicking. Now, I know that some stories may not be what it seems, but is it hard to believe that PCC would turn their backs on their students? Is it?

In all, I wouldn't encourage anyone to go to this school. It's like a occult. A daily routine with no change. Even with the friendly people and some people who care, it's just not worth it. Even the most of the education there is not accredited. That means all of your hard work and money spent just goes to waste, because you can't' get a job in most places. And that's bad. I won't take anything from that college except for the friends I've made there. Like I said before, I'm not going there anymore and don't plan to. So, I decided to write about it, and I did.


UPDATE- Anyone can ask me anything on here about Pensacola Christian College. Like a AMA of whatever they do on here.

UPDATE 2- Look, I'm not bashing this school and telling everyone not to go there. I'm just sharing my own thoughts and experiences after what I've been through. I wouldn't encourage anyone to go there. But hey, if you feel that it's the right place for you, it's fine. Whatever knocks your boat, I don't care. At the end of the day, it's your choice.

UPDATE 3- There's plenty more things that I could share, but i'm going to wait until their school year is finished. Why, because no one at the school will really care and some of my friends I know will be graduating. Then they won't get in any trouble. I don't want to risk their graduation if someone shares this post to people who would be interested in it. I will share stories about them when the time is right. I will also share why I had to leave Pensacola in a more detailed post when the school year is over . Stay tuned......

backindenim,1297894611,/r/AskReddit/comments/fmrmy/have_you_ever_had_a_dream_where_maybensfw/,"[No Joke, for better or worse I dreamt all of this last night.]

The dream started off with a blurred flashback type of scene with an Asian lady holding a cat and yelling ""It's the robbers! It's the robbers!"". I remember seeing that image and being both confused and oddly guilty feeling. 

Not sure what you call it in a dream, but right here is a (cut scene).

I come to... I'm on the couch in my apartment with a few friends sitting around me laughing. I'm viewing things in first person. My friend Zach is laughing the hardest and I ask him what's going on. 

""You don't remember?"" he says. 
""You've been out of your mind the last hour or so on THIS."" 

He points to his hand and I make eye contact with a white half cut pill in his palm. 

""You only had half!"" he said, continuing to laugh. 

Drowsily I pulled myself up and evaluated my condition. I am shirtless, my hair is completely tousled like Jim Carry when he's dressed as the mental patient in Ace Venture. I am wearing jeans and have a white powder on my bottom lip. 

""How've ya been bud?"" my friend Cole said as I stumbled into the kitchen looking for anything to drink.

""Better.""

""Haha yeah, I can imagine.. you were pretty nuts"" he says.

""You saw me? How long have you been here? What was I like?! Fuck, I never take drugs!"" I said in a haze of confusion. 

Just then more people start pouring into my apartment. I had apparently invited them all over to celebrate. I still wasn't sure what we were celebrating. 

""The snake!! Man.. oh shit you don't remember THAT?!"" Zach says as I plopped back on the couch still shirtless in jeans. 

""No.""

""Probably for the best!""

He takes the powder from the last half pill of what he was now referring to as ""Express"" and jokingly smears it onto my lips. Both lips immediately swell up and I feel like I had been spun several times around and set free. Like when you put your head on a baseball bat, spin, and try to run straight. 

(Passed out again.. cut scene)

I come to... for a second time. This time I am on my couch wearing dark khaki colored corduroys with a rip in the leg and a red and black plaid shirt.  My house is empty but you can clearly tell there had been a massive party there. 

I check my phone texts:

""Yo man, sorry we had to bounce. We are all on Eve St for the Halloween parade. Come when you're feeling up to it"" - T.J.

""Hey cutie. Eve street. Be there or be square. CUM!!"" - Nicole

I look around my living room and see a video camera on the brick next to my fireplace. 

Play. 

[Video Sequence] From the point of view of the camera lens.

Me laughing as I'm looking into the camera ""Ooooh man this shit is crazy!"" I'm waving my hand and making a warbling sound. Still clothed and neat looking. 

Cut. 

Me hanging up the phone....""I WON!"" 
All the people around me erupt in cheer. I had just won an exclusive Halloween dinner with Conan O'Brien on a radio show. 

Cut.

""He's passed out come in, come in!"" Zach says as I lay motionless on the couch. 

Still being filmed I'm asleep when a man with a gigantic green boa constrictor walks through the front door and puts the snake up to my nose. 

""AHHH!!!!"" Everyone screams and jostles me awake. 

I stare at the snake. Then, I see myself looking at me watching the camera footage of me staring at the snake. 

""I'm ok... I'm fine. Snakes don't bug me. I'm cool... I'm cool"" I say in the video.

As I hold the camera I think.. wow, that was incredibly badass of me. 
I rewind the footage to watch it again. Same thing.. ""He's passed out come in, come in!"" Zach says as I lay motionless on the couch. 

I'm asleep when the man with the green boa constrictor walks through the front door and puts the snake up to my nose. 

""Ahh! Oh God, get it away! Get it Away! Fuck! Jesus please! Oh my God, Oh my god!""

The room fills with laughter. 

""Guess not"" I thought to myself. 

Back in first person view I put the camera down and look out my window to see a black car waiting for me. The Conan O'Brien dinner. 

I run to my bedroom and pull on a black cashmere v-neck sweater over my red plaid shirt and keep on my ripped straight leg corduroys then make my way outside. 

(Cut scene)

Now I am in Conan's house at this table. The whole room looks to be made of polished wood. The table is a slightly darker wood stacked with white cloth placemats and crystal stemware. A huge flatscreen TV is on the wall beside it above a burning fireplace. 

He emerges from a back room wearing black pants and a purple smoking jacket that I initially thought was for comedic effect. Turns out he just liked to wear it. 

We eat dinner and casually talk. Dinner turns to desert and by this time we are kinda drunk. I tell him I should probably get going as he's ending his laughter from my previous joke he says, ""You're funny. You're a funny guy. You should come by some other time. It'd be great to have you over. I know my mother just loves you."" (She'd been at the dinner too)

Cut Scene. The rest of the dream is no longer in first person but multiple angles like a film. 

I am on a bridge above the Chicago River talking to my friend. We are discussing things but the ""view"" of me is from too far away and I hear more wind than conversation.

Cut Scene.

I am back at Conan O'Brien's house eating dinner in the same room. I am talking to his mother about how my mom is in the medical field and she should come be her live-in nurse as she is getting too old to successfully take care of herself. Conan, now wearing a black and yellow argyle sweater agrees to this. I express to him that ""something big is coming and this might be our last encounter."" We laugh and joke about things and I distinctively remember him reaching over to a very expensive looking wooden box and pushing an orange glowing button that dispensed purified water into his crystal glass. 

Cut Scene.

Turns out the conversation on the bridge had been with my friend Zach, the story's antagonist you could say. We had just robbed a very large bank in downtown Chicago and were pitted on the end of upper Whacker Drive by Lake Michigan with dozens of FBI agents and CPD officers pointing their guns at us. Negotiations occur. 

Through a megaphone comes ""Look, put down your weapons. It's over, we have you surrounded. There is no where to go!""

""Fuck you, fuck you!"" Zach says as he fires a few rounds in the air from behind our navy blue unmarked getaway car. 

Just then an agent walks up to us. Hands out. Unarmed. 

(A helicopter flys over our heads. It's getting dark out.)

The FBI special agent is now on the other side of the car. His hands open on the top. 

""Guys, come on. It's over. You both know it is. Now, you took the money but you haven't killed any body. Some property damage along the way sure, but your life doesn't have to end here. No one's does. No put down the guns and lets call it a day, huh?""

I contemplate giving up and actually begin to lower my gun. 
My thoughts are just then interrup--

""I have your daughter.""

Zach says this with a cold look on his face. Staring right into the agent's eyes. 

""That's impossible she's at home with..""

""Anne? Your after school babysitter? Haha, nah.. she's not. She's with one of our fuckin' guys, right now. What do you think about that Topcop? And right now, she's scared. A little banged up? Hey, I can't say. But what I do know is that YOU are out of options. And YOU will let US go. Now. Because if I don't get home safe tonight. Your little rugrat won't either. Hell, she might never. Get it?""

Zach maintains a look that is more threatening than his words. 

""Man, what the hell? Are you kidding me? How did you know? How did you do it!?"" I ask him, panicked. 

""Don't you fuckin worry about it"" he says waving the gun at me while maintaining eye contact with the special agent. ""Insurance.""

The agent, very slowly, with a shocked look in his eyes makes his way back to the officers packed tightly onto wide the street. 

After about three minutes they start moving their vehicles. 

Zach lets out a menacing laugh as we slowly cruise past them. 
As we are leaving with me driving, he reaches his head out the window of the car and fires approximately 10 shots back at the crowd of officers. At least two are hit. 

The cops jump in their vehicles and begin to chase us. We swerve up Michigan Avenue narrowly missing tourists and one ambulance. We loop back on to Lakeshore Drive right along the east coast of Lake Michigan and fly up the wrong lane through heavy traffic. I swerve onto an exit and head right back into the heart of downtown Chicago. Right as we hit the buildings I jump from the car without telling Zach. I run straight down an alleyway while the getaway car coasts into one of the support beams that hold the El train above traffic. He jumps out and runs after impact.

I see a scene with him running to a country club looking pool deck where a ""care package"" inexplicably falls out of the sky and onto the deck. He pulls more guns and ammo from the crate and runs to the bar asking for a bottle of water. The bartender hesitates and Zach shoots him, reaches over the counter, grabs the bottle and runs. 

He's on his way up a flight of stairs heading toward the train station when cops swarm toward him and gun him down between a frenzy of people screaming and dodging out of the way. 

Cut Scene.

Several hours have seemed to pass. My head emerges from the shadows of an alley. I am wearing all black and carrying 2 huge heavy duffle bags full of money. 

I start walking down the sidewalk in a Wrigleyville neighborhood when all of the sudden an Asian woman appears out of the shadows. 
I flash back to the same images I saw at the start of the dream (a woman yelling ""It's the robbers! It's the robbers!"") I think to myself ""Oh no! Was that foreshadowing? Is this it!?""

Just then she stands fully up from behind the dark green dumpster she was reaching under with an orange and white cat tucked firmly against her chest. She smiles, ""Mr. Rogers! It's Mr. Rogers"" she says as she extends the cat out to me to give it a petting. I obligue and laugh to myself as I walk away into the night.

The very last segment of the dream is an overhead shot of me on a hot beach sitting next to Cameron Diaz in a navy blue bikini with white polka dots. 

I wake up.

I think ""What the hell just happened!?""

I type this.

RayosX,1295168599,/r/AskReddit/comments/f37ei/universal_health_careprivilege_or_human_right/,"Well Reddit that's the question that destroyed friendships today...here is my story...

today i lost two ""Friends""...spent an hour debating with them over Universal Health Care...only to walk away...it was 2 vs 1. (me being the 1) they believe that health care, was a privilege, not a human right...and that just because they have a nice job that subsidies their insurance, that they shouldn't have to pay medicare costs for others... They're logic was, if you can't afford it, well you're gonna die then...i was a irate and trying to argue from a humanistic point of view, trying to weigh the value of a human life vs an animal...say such as a dog...they sided with the dog...If your friends wont help a stranger, then why would you want their help?! Well, anyways...After 4 hours pass... I get a message on facebook...

The quotation marks are from his letter… the in between is my response to each part… (sorry, I struggle with reddit formatting)

Let me address a few issues here in your letter…

“Hey, take a look at the definition -- a dog is a conscious being. What's funny is, were you lying hurt in the middle of a road, a passing dog would likely be the first to tend to you before a human driving by.”

YES…but sentient no…

“I was very disrespected by your treatment of my house by yelling in my front yard as well as your blatant disregard to what had been said to you. You tried to turn our discussion into a personal assault by dishonestly claiming that none of us would help you if you were hurt, despite the fact that we'd covered that ground not 15 minutes earlier.”

First of all, really, I’ve invited you and Jacob over many times in the past, and my parents we’re none to happy about it the next day, I never really said anything to you about it to you guys, no, my parents would complain to me the next days about it. I never said too much to you guys, you guys we’re my friends. As for the yelling, volume control is my bad.

Personal assault…no not really…but I don’t want your guy’s help for anything…ever…just because you “know me” which you really don’t, is the only reason why you would help me as a human being is just sad…

“You are welcome to be a part of society as long as you are willing to treat others with the same respect you would expect rather than being a hypocrite”

Arzate…(note, the friend I’m arguing with, bang his roommate/bestfriend’s girlfriend about a year ago, it’s her last name…now his “bestfriend/roommate” are arguing with me)

“Running out of the house claiming your sorrow for other humans while simultaneously disrespecting those you seek to win the respect of is not a winning strategy. All humans do not have a right to good health -- humans DO however have a right to an opinion.”

Yes you do have an opinion, and I do to… …I left also because I was being double teamed by you and Jacob. And not really given a chance to speak, both of you we’re cutting me off when I tried speaking near the end to voice my opinion and I got frustrated.

“The cause you are fighting for is a noble one. I hope you can find a way to help it based on facts rather than faith. You are choosing religion over science and you will find a hard, uphill, nigh unwinnable battle fighting this way. Rather than cry over spilled milk, find a system that works the way you wish it to and champion it.”

Europe, Canada, Japan…already got better systems than us and better life expectancy… and I’m sorry my empathy for humanity comes off as “religion”…

“Unless and until you can find such a working system, most reasonable folk will find you best advised to join a communist country and see how you like what you find.”

Reasonable folk would recommend a communist country?...please stop watching Glen Beck… And I’ll go to Canada… they’re rated 11th in life expectancy vs. Americas awesome 37th…

“I wouldn't recommend this extreme. Instead, I would recommend you pursue a financially reasonable career that could support both yourself and your cause, so that you may accomplish something in this world. People habitually underestimate the value of a dollar until they are forced to utilize one to defend themselves in the free world. Most are not so lucky to be provided free housing and food. When you earn your keep, it is not so cheap to give away.”

Why don’t you try finding a new job (same pay and benefits) in this economy...NOT EASY!!! …

Adios…

I'm pissed off...this kinda friend likes to ride his high horse around like his shit don't stink...i dunno...i guess i just needed to vent or something...

::EDIT::

::(Received this)::

Sentient: 1) responsive to or conscious of sense impressions 2) aware 3) finely sensitive in perception or feeling

A dog fits all three of these descriptions. You do not understand the words you are using. The problem may be supporting other peoples arguments without having done proper research to understand what you are supporting.

Europe is not a country and Canadians have told me what I told you earlier -- blanket health care systems don't work as well as they look on paper.

Our obvious problem is a young generation not taught to handle themselves, expecting the world owed to them on a silver platter. Nothing is for free and nothing should ever be for free. If it is free, it is undeserved.

Yes, were I in your shoes, it would be nearly impossible to find a job that pays well and has good health benefits. There were options available to avoid this. Nestor and Joe went to school for subjects that they could apply to their lives to earn them reasonable income. I went into a random entry level job and worked my way up; 5 years experience in many industries is worth the same as a college education. Some people choose to find ways just to skate by.

Those that choose to skate by later find themselves is tough spots. You are implying that they should be given the same opportunities as the people that worked hard to get where they are. If they could have the same opportunities, what incentive would there be for anyone to work hard? That's the type of thinking that leads to communism rather than progress. ""Let's bring all of the wealthy people down instead of helping those below the poverty line.""

Shit, yeah, I could throw you a fish every day of your life so you could have something to eat. I'd really rather teach you how to fish so that you could (a) eat and (b) maybe make something of yourself by teaching others how to fish, too.

If you choose to throw everything away, don't expect someone to hand it back to you just because your parents do. Not everyone is lucky enough to be spoiled.

::(RESPONDED WITH)::

You honestly don't think i've been fucking trying...really now...Back at Mt.Sac, i used to hang out with you and Jacob all the Time...Fucking worst mistake of my life...i failed so badly because you guys always wanted to hang out and play games and do nothing...so really in that regard fuck you guys for dragging me down to that level, i was to nice to say anything and failed with you guys...and i don't want fish from you, I'm tired of your god damn smug attitude that you've had about being better...congrats only a HS degree and you've made it...WOOOOH...

I'm not trying to fucking skate by either, I'm applying everywhere and anywhere looking for anything to get in anywhere entry level, i have no god damn problem working my way up...I'm not expecting a fucking silver platter of anything...

and i don't take my parents things anymore...everything I'm given (besides room and the occasional meal on weekends), i sneak right back into my parents wallets when they're not looking...so yeah...great misconception you have of me...as i said, you really don't know me anymore...


::(his response)::

I hung out with you and Jacob. Jacob hung out with you and me. You could have had Jacobs job, even. You didn't give a damn at the time.

First, you said we have the things you want -- such as a decent job and health insurance. Now, we're the ones that prevented you from having it. I'm sorry dude, that's called not being a man.

If Jacob and I went to your parents right now and told them we'd like to have an intervention with you because you've never done anything with your life, they'd be on board. What does that tell you?

You've spent loads of time not looking for a real job, even if you are now. Why lie about what you've done instead of accept it and move on?

A real friend will stab you in the front. How does it feel? 

::(my response)::

You're not preventing me from jack shit right now, back when i was a naive 18 year old yeah. i thought, hey these guys are friends lets do what they're doing! but no...you guys brought me down...i followed you like a tool...

and you know what, i am looking for a god damn job, you know nothing about what i do, try spending 2 hours on each fucking job application from assistant jobs to entry level jobs.....

also, stay the fuck away from my family, you're no longer welcome around here....

and this economy sucks, and i don't want you nor Jacob's job, i'll find my own way in life, but congrats to the both of you... but you guys seriously stay out of my life from here on out, I'm done with you and you're arrogant self-righteous ass...

BTW, currently, you have the one thing i desire, health care...that's it... oh i'm sorry, i'm one of the few who can't afford it...well fuck me then... 

::(his response again)::

If you're a tool as you've admitted (as opposed to someone calling you one) it has nothing to do with anyone else. You're 26 and it's time to man up and grow a pair. Look to your father for guidance. I'm sure he does not blame his short comings on anyone else.

I guess I should really put some heart and soul into thinking about an intervention for you. Everyone would love to see you grow into a good man that supports the world around him rather than mooching from it. Nestor did it. Joe did it. I did it. Jacob did it. Vincent did it. You can blame any of us at any time you choose, as a way to enable yourself to fail -- or you can blame the man at fault and do something about it. 

::(my response)::
Wow seriously this is the self righteous asshole that I've been talking about...a fucking.intervention? Wow I'm sorry you didn't have parents who cared for you in life. And I've said this once. I'll say It again. Fuck you. Stay out of my life and away from my family. It's my family not Urs. I honestly want nothing to do with you anymore. So please stop talking to me. We're done... think that you won but in all honesty. But I could care less... 




P.S. also note, they didn't think illegal immigrants should receive health care because they're illegal and not paying taxes and are not contributing to the pot...

*Preface*

  I've just turned 20, and am enrolled in community college, paid for by my parents. It's my second semester, it's going great so far (good grades), and I'm working toward entering a nursing school. I do not have a job. I have been looking for and applying to minimum-wage positions for months, but it has not happened. I unfortunately do not have any experience other than babysitting and nannying, and I can work very few hours per week because my classes demand a lot of study time; pretty sure that's what's keeping me from getting a job, because I have good references and write well. :/ I do babysit often, though. I also have been using one of their cars to get to school. They pay for the insurance, I pay for the gas, and I clean that car and their other cars every month to keep that up. It has been a very generous situation, and I am grateful. Since they have a maid (**Edit:** By maid, I mean once-a-month cleaning service, not a daily maid), I've been doing only minimal chores (50% of the dishes, with little brother doing the other 50%; room cleaning, obviously; anything else they ask, like taking out the trash or cleaning the bathroom or kitchen, and so on.).

**I would like to preface this next part by saying that my parents are good people with a lot of admirable qualities.**

  That being said, they've got a few issues. They are very angry people. Always have been, as far as I can remember. They fight loudly and horribly very often. They don't hit (used to spank, but only until I was ten), but they do shout, mostly at each other. They seem incapable of being peaceful. It's as if they don't want to be. They seek out arguments and try to stir things up, mostly with each other, but also with my siblings and me. This is hard to say, but I have to admit that they are very verbally and emotionally abusive. 

  They scream horrible things at me if there is a dish left in the sink for five minutes. They've told me I am evil, they've called me a monster, they've called me a ""filthy pig"", they've told me I am worthless, they've told me that no one would ever want me, they tell me I am disrespectful and ungrateful even though I never say anything disrespectful and I do thank them (maybe not enough...hard to tell what's enough for them, though), they've told me I am mentally deficient/ill, they've said I have the devil inside me, they've told me I'm fat, they've told me I'm lazy, they constantly hold the fact that they allow me to live with them and pay for my college over my head and use it to tell me I have no rights nor am allowed to say anything they don't want to hear (including ""please don't yell at me"") (I kind of see their point on that, but they can't claim it's benevolent if they complain about it constantly and use it for their own gains. By gains, I mean the satisfaction of reassuring themselves that they have complete power over me, which they love), they taunt my interests no matter what they are just because they can, they make fun of my friends, they say horrible things about my sister behind her back, they say bad things about me to complete strangers while I am in their presence, they often tell me that they're going to kick me out, and they have basically screamed out my self-confidence. 

  I'm not talking every once in a while. They scream these things at me every couple of days, sometimes because I didn't do the dishes before being asked or something of that nature, and sometimes for no reason at all. They scream and shout until I am cowering in a corner, trying very hard not to cry until they get tired of it and leave. When I was younger, I used to defend myself by telling them they shouldn't shout at me like that. That never went well, so I stopped. I don't say anything at all. My face goes completely blank, and I just take it until they leave. And then I hide in my closet, hold my stuffed animals, and cry as quietly as I can. 

*Admittance of Guilt*

  Which is not to say I am perfect. I don't clean my room often enough. True, their standard for it is crazy OCD, but that's their standard, and I haven't been working hard enough to keep it up. However, I'm not sure anything ever would be enough. I've tried, but even when it's as clean as I know how to make it, they start shouting about how filthy it is, so I kind of figure maybe it's not worth trying quite that hard all the time. I should try harder, though. In the incident I'm going to tell you about, I fully admit that I did wrong and they have every right to be angry and punish me, by the way. 

**The Actual Incident**

  One of their rules is that no food can go into my room. I broke that rule on Wednesday night by taking a bowl of cereal into my room. I was wrong. My dad ""caught me in the act"" of having that cereal in my room, and told me I should find someplace else to live. However, he says that a lot, so I thought he was just speaking in anger again. However, the next morning while I was in class, he texted me telling me to pack my things and leave. After school, I did just that, before going back to my other class. Later on that night while I was at a friend's house, they texted me giving me ""the terms"": to arrange a meeting with a counselor the following week (meaning this Thursday or Friday) so we could talk about it. So I made plans with friends to stay alive for a week. I have no money to speak of (like 60 bucks, which I need for gas), no job, and no other family within a thousand miles. They told me to drive downtown to a homeless shelter, or sleep in the car (it was really cold that night, too). 

  The next day, I went back to get a few more things, but my dad got mad at me for not asking permission first. He also told me I was not allowed to have any food. I figured I would have to rough it for a week (friends who took me in cannot afford to feed me, and I wouldn't ask them to). But last night, they texted me angrily saying they were throwing the rest of my stuff away and that the meet-with-a-counselor-and-figure-things-out deal was gone, and I'm permanently banned from the house. Oh, also, that morning I was officially kicked out, they emptied the contents of my trash can onto my bed and told me to clean it up. Dumped my loose-leaf anatomy textbook pages on there, too. Fortunately they stayed together and didn't get stained badly. My parents also told me that as soon as I get a job, they will give me the title of the car, so that's my remaining glimmer of hope for survival. 

  Now, I get it...I don't clean my room enough, and I shouldn't have taken food to my room. But I have been cut off entirely for it. I know it's their right to do so. Obviously it is. I just don't understand why, exactly. Some days, it seems great. They seem okay with the state of my room, and thank me for doing the dishes. Then a few hours later, they'll fly off the handle over the same situation. 

 *Other Items*

 They fudge on their rules, too. A couple of months ago, I was told (screamed at) that closing my door, ever, was a sign of ""ultimate disrespect"", and that they should never ever have to knock on my door. It was their house, and they owned everything, and how dare I ""challenge [their] authority by closing my door?! Ungrateful, spoiled brat! You go live somewhere else if you want to do that! See if anyone else will put up with your horrible attitude! Go on, leave!"" And then they took my door. Two days later, they gave it back and said I could close it if I wanted to.  There's really no consistency here. One day, they were ready to disown me for closing my door. Two days later, it was totally fine. That's one of the only time I've ever seen them relinquish control of anything. It shocked me. 

My concern is that this isn't really about me disobeying the rule. They tend to take their frustrations out on my siblings and me when they are angry about anything at all, especially me. Something about me has always ticked them off. My siblings and I could tell they treated me differently from the time I was...I dunno, 7? Around there.  I think they're having other troubles, and are fixating on my mistake and trying to get their frustrations out on that so that they can feel that they have all their precious control again.  Lately, the two of them have been fighting a lot more than usual. Like I said, they like to fight and be angry at the world, but it's worse than usual. Reminds me of the time they separated from each other a few years ago. It was bad for them, but for us kids, it was a living hell, and we are lucky to have been able to come out of it relatively unscarred. Got on the verge of being messed up for life over it. I had a birthday while that was going on. My dad backed me into a corner and screamed into my ear (I don't even remember what for) until I had a nervous breakdown and collapsed. I was 15. Since then, I've learned to handle the screaming episodes with a much more stiff upper lip.

  They've also been texting me to taunt me about how bad and hopeless my situation is, offering no help. I guess that makes them feel better.

*Help Me*
  
Reddit, I need to know what to do. I have a few offers from dear friends to move in with them, but very far away. I need to finish the semester of school here. After this, and two summer classes, I will be set to apply to nursing schools. I need to figure out how to survive here. I feel bad about asking friends. I have good friends, but I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I also want to figure out what I did wrong. :/ I must have done something wrong. Feel free to call me on my crap and point it out and ask more. Obviously this is very biased and one-sided, but I've been trying to think about it from their view, and truly...I got nothin'. :( Literally and figuratively. x)

**EDIT:** I can hardly believe it, but...somebody stole my phone at the school library today. It was on my desk next to me, and a minute later, it was gone. I searched everywhere, asked people around me, asked lost and found three times and even the campus police, but no luck. I'm in shock.

sigh I really don't know where to begin, but I guess this all started when I first moved out of my folks' house, when I was 18... I've known forever that I was gay and when I came out to my parents at 16, who are strict Catholics, did not take it well. I was not kicked out of the house but I was judged very harshly from then on. My mother threatened to kill herself when I told her, my father tried to ""make me straight"". It was clear I needed to get the hell out of that living situation as soon as I possibly could.

The minute I graduated High School I got a decent retail job making a little above minimum wage. I saved up what I could while still helping out my family, and when I was able to move out I did. I shared a place with a few people, where I lived comfortably for about a year. I kept working hard and saving money, even getting a second job to put away for college. I met a guy, we fell in love, life was good...

A year or so passed and I was informed that the people who where buying the house where I was renting a room could no longer afford the mortgage, and they would have to sell the house. I had to find a place to live, and I had to do it ASAP. My boyfriend and I decided that it was time to move in together. So we started looking around at apartments.

I had never had any indication that I was any different from any other person, other than the fact that my parents where from Mexico and, of coarse, the gay thing. When my boyfriend and I found a place we liked and could afford, we immediately applied and began moving preperations. Much to my surprise, my application was rejected. I was shocked, I had never opened up a credit card (on the advice of a few coworkers who knew I was saving up for college. They told me that I would just get into debt with one, and I wanted to start college free of that), I had no car (couldn't afford one), and had excellent history paying all of my bills. I knew I had little credit history, but this place wasn't expensive, and between my two jobs I could more than afford this place.

They told me my SSN was being rejected, that the credit people they used to do background checks said my number was (I remember this clearly, because I had absolutely no idea what the hell this meant) ""Out of bounds"". I was told I had to provide another proof of residency. I had never ever had anything like this happen to me before, I was able to land two jobs and go to school just fine.

I immediately called my parents up and asked them what was going on. My mother said she would try and find my birth certificate but that it would take some time, she would have to do some digging. Housing situation falling apart very quickly, I decided that it would be for the best to move back home just for a month until the credit situation got straightened out and I could move in with the BF.

sigh And then shit hit the fan. When I moved back home, my parents (who had considerably improved their attitudes towords my homosexuality) expected me to pay them rent. I was OK with this, I made a decision to move out so I had chosen my role as an adult. This pushed my college plans way back however, which I wasn't happy about. My father also had different views on how I should be living my life, and we fought constantly. It got so bad that it almost headed towards physical altercation on many occasions. My mother would not give me my birth certificate, and at this point the commute to, from, and between both jobs was grueling. I decided I needed to get one job, closer to the Apartments where I wanted to live. When I informed my parents of this, my mother dropped the bombshell.

They told me that when I was 5 years old, they had me smuggled into the country. That before this, I was living with some relatives who agreed to watch over me while my parents staked out a niche in the US. That the reason for them moving here to begin with was that we where an affluent family in Mexico, and this lead to my kidnapping when I was only 3. That my whole entire life had been a sham. That my documents and paperwork saying I was a US citizen, the very documents I had used to land my jobs and was going to try to go to school with, where forged. I didn't exist. I was an illegal immigrant, not by my own choice. They showed me my birth certificate, and sure enough, it was in some hospital in the Federal District of Mexico.

I don't think I'd known sadness until then. I was crushed. I wept for days, not knowing what to do. My parents did little to comfort me, they told me they where ""Hoping for a way to make me legal"". I didn't tell anybody. Not for a while. I finally decided to tell my boyfriend at the time, and that was a mistake. He said he'd be supportive of me and help me, he even managed to help me find a new roommate(he'd lost his job at this point, and I wanted now more than ever to leave my parents house for good). We packed up all of my things in the dead of night, and I left.

I started living with this guy at some really shady apartments, ones where they didn't do full-on credit checks, just made sure you had a job. Things started out fine, but my boyfriends attitude towards me changed completely. He began to be abusive, not physically but he would always put me down or just treat me generally bad. I dumped him when I couldn't take anymore, when I felt like I was just losing myself more and more to his abuse. He threatened to have me deported, and I panicked. Those where empty threats, but the gravity of of this secret I had to now keep alone was too much.

I've only told 4 people this my entire life. Three very close friends, and my now-ex. I am afraid to let anyone know what is going on, but I can't live with this anymore. I'm so scared, I'm so alone, and no one understands what I am going through. I feel completely alone, and lost. I can't afford a lawyer, and I've been looking into citizenship and it seems that for the most part this is a process that takes years and years and lots of money(which I don't have). The only option is marriage...

I met a girl I thought I could trust with this. We where close, like brother and sister close. We decided that even though she had a boyfriend we would attempt to marry and fake it till I was a citizen. This all came crashing down when I found out she told everyone of our friends that I was illegal. I was crushed, again. I learned not to trust people with this, that I had to keep it hidden at all costs. Especially since some of those friends where not trustworthy. As luck would have it, some of those friends and I had a falling out. A bad one. Now I am scared that out of anger they will tell more people, and eventually the wrong person will know and get my ass deported.

My lease for this apartment will be up in a month, and I have nowhere to go. I have an out-of-state ID that expires at the end of this year, a valid Tax ID number, and nothing else. I am in debt due to this apartment being more costly than I originaly calculated(and losing my second job). None of my friends have any room for me to stay with them, nor do I feel I can trust a coworker or stranger for a roommate. I could move back home, but I know this will get me nowhere, and due to the distance I would have to quit my job.

Reddit... I don't know what to do anymore. I am cripplingly depressed. I don't feel that I can go on living like this much longer, a criminal in my own country. I don't know spanish that well, I don't know the first thing about mexican culture, and I don't know anyone in Mexico. I was raised here. My entire life I've played by the rules, stayed out of trouble, studied hard (when I found out I couldn't really get to college, I started studying to become A+ certified at least) for nothing. All my life I thought I was just another person, to have that yanked out from under you... I don't know how I managed to get this far.

My work ethic has considerably dropped, I don't go out and see my friends as much as I used to, and I don't even leave the house most days unless I absolutely have to. I have pondered suicide more times than I can count. I figured, hey, they will probably kill me for being gay in Mexico, and I can't live like this forever without getting caught, so my not nip this in the bud? I have overcome these feelings each and every time, but as the day that I will probably be moving back home draws closer... I have to try harder and harder to get up in the morning. I feel like my family is the only reason I haven't already, like I'd be bringing them untold pain and shame that they don't deserve. That it's selfish of me.

I am not asking for a handout, I am asking for advice. For guidance. I am so scared, more scared than anyone can imagine... I am so alone and jaded by the people that have betrayed me with this secret before. I don't hate my parents, but I resent them so much for making this choice for me. I don't know where to turn anymore... as I type this tears keep welling up in my eyes with the thought that I may be kicked out of the my home just because someone doesn't like the color of my skin. Or my lisp. Or the way I walk. Is there any hope left, reddit? I can't stress enough that I am completely petrified of my future, and I don't know what to do anymore... How can I get legal counseling for something like this? I just need some advice, or just to hear that it'll be OK and I'll make it...

I dumped him when I couldn't take anymore, when I felt like I was just losing myself more and more to his abuse. He threatened to have me deported, and I panicked. Those where empty threats, but the gravity of of this secret I had to now keep alone was too much.

I've only told 4 people this my entire life. Three very close friends, and my now-ex. I am afraid to let anyone know what is going on, but I can't live with this anymore. I'm so scared, I'm so alone, and no one understands what I am going through. I feel completely alone, and lost. I can't afford a lawyer, and I've been looking into citizenship and it seems that for the most part this is a process that takes years and years and lots of money(which I don't have). The only option is marriage...

I met a girl I thought I could trust with this. We where close, like brother and sister close. We decided that even though she had a boyfriend we would attempt to marry and fake it till I was a citizen. This all came crashing down when I found out she told everyone of our friends that I was illegal. I was crushed, again. I learned not to trust people with this, that I had to keep it hidden at all costs. Especially since some of those friends where not trustworthy. As luck would have it, some of those friends and I had a falling out. A bad one. Now I am scared that out of anger they will tell more people, and eventually the wrong person will know and get my ass deported.

My lease for this apartment will be up in a month, and I have nowhere to go. I have an out-of-state ID that expires at the end of this year, a valid Tax ID number, and nothing else. I am in debt due to this apartment being more costly than I originaly calculated(and losing my second job). None of my friends have any room for me to stay with them, nor do I feel I can trust a coworker or stranger for a roommate. I could move back home, but I know this will get me nowhere, and due to the distance I would have to quit my job.

Reddit... I don't know what to do anymore. I am cripplingly depressed. I don't feel that I can go on living like this much longer, a criminal in my own country. I don't know spanish that well, I don't know the first thing about mexican culture, and I don't know anyone in Mexico. I was raised here. My entire life I've played by the rules, stayed out of trouble, studied hard (when I found out I couldn't really get to college, I started studying to become A+ certified at least) for nothing. All my life I thought I was just another person, to have that yanked out from under you... I don't know how I managed to get this far.

My work ethic has considerably dropped, I don't go out and see my friends as much as I used to, and I don't even leave the house most days unless I absolutely have to. I have pondered suicide more times than I can count. I figured, hey, they will probably kill me for being gay in Mexico, and I can't live like this forever without getting caught, so my not nip this in the bud? I have overcome these feelings each and every time, but as the day that I will probably be moving back home draws closer... I have to try harder and harder to get up in the morning. I feel like my family is the only reason I haven't already, like I'd be bringing them untold pain and shame that they don't deserve. That it's selfish of me.

I am not asking for a handout, I am asking for advice. For guidance. I am so scared, more scared than anyone can imagine... I am so alone and jaded by the people that have betrayed me with this secret before. I don't hate my parents, but I resent them so much for making this choice for me. I don't know where to turn anymore... as I type this tears keep welling up in my eyes with the thought that I may be kicked out of the my home just because someone doesn't like the color of my skin. Or my lisp. Or the way I walk. Is there any hope left, reddit? I can't stress enough that I am completely petrified of my future, and I don't know what to do anymore... How can I get legal counseling for something like this? I just need some advice, or just to hear that it'll be OK and I'll make it...

PS. Yes, this is a throwaway account

grahamalondis,1588102582,/r/college/comments/g9twm9/im_graduating_with_a_bachelors_and_a_40_in_two/,"So I'll start off by saying that a 4.0 goal GPA isn't going to be worth it to you unless you want to go to a top-20 law school or graduate program (in which cases you can still get in with 3.8 and lower). Law school has been my goal, and now that I'm in the thick of prep I do not regret any of it at all. Law schools count A+s toward GPA, so my law school apps will list my GPA as 4.07: this is well above even the 75th percentile GPA for admitted students at Harvard, Yale and Stanford; in other words, because I worked so hard, all I need is a great LSAT score and I can go to the best law schools with major scholarships, perhaps even some full-rides at some schools. Sometimes it pays! But again, don't shoot for a 4.0 unless you have the highest goals. 


That said, don't blow off your GPA either. I've gotten really good scholarship money and named awards such as a faculty endowed scholarship that's really nice to have on a resume (I was the one person at my CC to receive the award). But you have to apply—most people don't make the effort and miss out big time.


There was also one instance when DegreeWorks was not displaying my classes correctly and my advisor was telling me I needed more classes than I had thought. I insisted something was wrong and she figured it out manually. She said for most students she would have probably blown off those claims, but because my grades were perfect she knew I wasn't pulling stuff out of thin air. You really never know in what ways it might help you.



Okay! Enough with that. Onto the general stuff.



Community college

Start at CC if your parents aren't paying your way. Some are better than others, but most CCs are the exact same education. A lot of my CC profs also worked at the university I transferred to. Don't get hung up on ""the college experience."" It's not completely bullshit but it's mostly bullshit. It's what convinces you to live on campus for 4 years and pay 4 years of tuition. The savings are significant and will shorten/lower your student loan payments. If you're at college/going to college to socialize, you're in the wrong place. There's plenty of ways to make friends without spends tens of thousands in extra money.


Quick note on loans: many students don't understand that unsubsidized loans start accruing interest immediately. Borrow carefully.


Be Aware of Benefits

Make sure that if you have a parent who is a veteran that you have fully explored benefits. I'm in Texas and part of a big family. Our first two college grads didn't know that Hazelwood could exempt their tuition. So only one sister and I have used the exemption. We both paid CC out of pocket so between the two of us we didn't even used all the exempted hours in the benefit. My little brother is at CC now and will use the rest of the credits when he transfers. Between the 3 of us we will have collectively spent around 15K for 3 associate's and bachelor's degrees. That's before you count the scholarships and grants. Because my family is not wealthy (good grant $), and because of my dad's military benefits, and because of my scholarships, I've actually been PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. This isn't going to be the situation for most people—my point is that you shouldn't be like my two older siblings who didn't know what they were entitled to. 




Gen Ed's/Core Curriculum

These are generally hated and blown off. I get it, you think you know all this stuff already. The truth is that you don't. Being smart isn't knowing everything, it's knowing when you don't know something and then doing what you can to learn more. What I think really helped me was how open I was to all the gen eds. I would always find a way to connect the content of each class (1) to my life and (2) to all the classes I'm taking and often those I've taken before. Not only does this help you make sense of the world but it also helps you remember the content of each class—this will help you in life and help you ace future courses as you build your knowledge. Doing this helps your brain form connections, and knowledge that has multiple connections is easiest to access. In short, view gen eds as opportunities. There's always something you don't know or a connection you haven't made.


Majors and Careers

You'll hear a lot that you don't need to know everything before you start, and that's true. That first year is a time to explore your options. I went in as a Psych major and came out an English major who now loves books and writing. However, the rubber meets the road your second year. You don't have to know your exact job yet, but you need to settle on a major ASAP to avoid taking fall through classes, paying extra money for school, and delaying your graduation. It's not a good time. And to that end, you should figure out your exact career as a senior and shape class projects around your career specialties. For example this semester I've been doing a legal-based project.


Study Abroad

If you are remotely interested in study abroad, do it in your first year and a half. You won't have too much of your degree plan filled in, which allows you to fill gen eds abroad or take on some electives. I did study abroad my last semester of CC. I had to take one fall through class to get to go because my plan was too full. They're also different lengths—mine was only 2 weeks abroad. I had a scholarship pay most of the costs and my CC had a program that gave people free summer tuition for being full time the previous two semesters. I paid almost nothing to go because I used that faculty endowed scholarship to cover almost all the ~$1000 leftover to pay. Look into it! There's a lot of scholarship money available for it and especially at CC it isn't costly at all.



Studying

I don't think I'm smarter than my average classmates. I just wanted it enough to genuinely make an effort for every assignment. This means *doing the reading*.Make a schedule that works for you. You might have to sacrifice some things here and there, but that's a cost/benefit calculation for you to make. Just give everything a real effort and make the connections I already talked about. For really tough classes, I'd always read the optional texts and sometimes seek out extra books to help me understand (Spanish was a real bitch). I personally found group study distracting and unproductive for me, but do what helps you.



Classes Everyone Should Take

1. Technical Writing/Business Writing: no matter your major, this class teaches important skills such as cover letters, *good* resumes, business reports, and other types of documents you WILL need to write effectively. I honestly think this class should be listed as a gen ed.



2. Business Applications/MS Office
A lot of people know this stuff. But this is your chance to learn more about MS Excel/spreadsheets. Basically everything job these days requires spreadsheet knowledge.


Non-liberal arts majors: take some kind of writing-intensive course. Everyone needs to write better. Most people do not write well at all. This is especially important if your major doesn't usually allow for professor interaction. Professors who read your writing typically get to know you better than a professor who doesn't. These classes are great networking opportunities to build relationships with professors who can write great letters of recommendation for you and might even reach out to you with jobs (they both know you and are highly skilled writers). If you can't bring yourself to take one, show up to office hours whether you need help or not. I've had multiple professors come to me with job opportunities, and I'm close to enough of them that I'm having a hard time choosing which ones to write my LORs for law school. They're major resources for you. Don't waste it! I had a personal rule of *at minimum* making sure every single Prof knew me by name.



Make Friends

I made a lot of friends in my classes, but I wish I'd made even more. They can help you get through this experience in one piece and remain friends long after (I still talk to friends who graduated before me). Make friends in your major classes especially because you need to start making professional connections right away. Clubs and other volunteering options are also good for this: I wish I were able to do these things more, but between school and working to live I just didn't have the time to do very often.



Working

Everyone's situation is different, but I ended up with a really flexible driving job for an incredible company. It paid great for the type of work and didn't drain my mental energy. I'd also often use podcasts and audio books to make up for missed study time. It's definitely beneficial to work in your career field, but often these positions are mentally draining and do not pay well and are not flexible.



Internships

Work at least one of these before you graduate. Unpaid work sucks, but when the hiring choice is you with no internship vs. another student with an internship, that other student is getting the job 9/10 times



Research and Publishing

Try to undertake at least one MAJOR project. It doesn't have to be a thesis, but make something at some point that is significant work that you can add to your portfolio. You can also submit this work or other work to journals. Being published is huge to have on a resume, especially for grad school or professional school. I researched and wrote this huge project about my school, but its contents were way too sensitive to publish anywhere. Oh well. You can also submit your work to your school's or a nearby school's research conference. I ended up winning 1st place prize for work that I submitted on a whim.



That's about all I can think of right now. Feel free to ask questions if there's something I didn't cover.


All in all, college has been a truly life changing experience, and my confidence has gone from the lowest lows to the highest highs. Enjoy the experience, socialize (if you want to) make friends, and have fun. Just don't forget that you're there to learn and to advance your career.



PS I'll add that liberal arts gets a lot of hate, but it's mostly founded on job outcomes. There's so much that I've learned in these courses and so much that I've read that has totally changed the way I look at the world and life in general. Keep in mind that there's plenty of stuff worth learning even if it isn't relevant to your career.

I'll also recognize that not all of this will be helpful to everyone. I've been incredibly fortunate these 4 years. As much as I'd like to say it was all hard work, I think have had some good strokes of luck.",college,I'm graduating with a Bachelor's and a 4.0 in two weeks—this is my advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g9twm9/im_graduating_with_a_bachelors_and_a_40_in_two/,1588124182.0,can't pay for school,12.686666666666667
[deleted],1344785723,/r/psychology/comments/y3ggd/i_need_some_serious_help_fast/,"I was thinking whether to seek for help or not too because I'm really scared of what will happened at the end. Anyways, let me get started.

Let me start off by saying, I was never interested in school.
A few months ago around January or February I dropped out of school.
A nice lady from school gave my Mom a number to call to ask for help. An agency that helps you with things like going back to school, therapy ect.

My mom didn't call right away. So, finally around March or April a case manager came to my house. We talked about stuff, my plans things like that. I wasn't interested at first to do anything.
I went through therapy but it didn't help much.

Fast forward to around June or so and here where I start having real fucking problems. I smoked weed with a few of my Sister's friends.
I've smoked weed before but I never had Deja Vu. So, we smoked and I experienced Deja Vu for the first time. I was really scared, everything felts so real, I try calming myself to see what will happened next. I guess the reason why I got Deja Vu was because the weed was actually good or because it had something on it because before I used to smoke weed, not everyday but I never had Deja Vu before. I was having Deja Vu the entire time I was high.
A few things that I predicted that will happened was that one of my Sister's friend was going to get beat by my dogs. I was paranoid and I tried so hard to make him stay inside the house and not come outside no matter what. Another one was when I kept walking from the Kitchen to my room and the windows were open the way it looks outside felt so real, so vivid. Another one was when my Sister's friend decided to go buy pizza. The way the car pull away from the house also felt so real like I've experienced before. Another one was my mom coming to the house and saw that were acting strange and caught us. The last one I had on the first day was that I was sitting down watching T.V and eating pizza and Mom coming inside of my Sister room. Everything just felt so real. No my sister's friend didn't get beat by the dogs, no mom didn't caught us, and yes my mom did come inside my sister room and saw me eating pizza. So, not everything happened how it was suppose to happened. I was really paranoid for a few days. Second time I smoked, same thing happened deja vu while I was high, mom caught us. One weird thing that happened on the second day was that I asked my mom to take me to the GYM. While she was driving, she was talking on the phone crying. And something popped into my head, oh my god she got fired. She was indeed crying but not because she got fired.
Again, I was scared and paranoid for a few days. The third and last time I smoked weed, this one really hit the spot. I had the normal, everything felt like I've experienced this before moment. But this time I sat down and thought of my future, I also thought of my Girlfriend and I. I saw that I wasn't going to be with her, that really scared the fuck out of me, it really hit the spot. I started texting her, calling her, leaving messages on facebook. No answered for 1 week. That 1 week was horrible as fuck. Then I started looking through skype logs and saw that she said she was going to the beach for a week+. That calm me down for like an hour. I'm online dating, I know a lot of people don't agree with this. I've been dating her for 3 almost 4 years and I really love her and she means a lot to me. During the second week of not hearing from her I decided I needed to change my life around. I called my case manager told her to come over that I've made up my mind. I was already schedule to go see a real 'professional' she wasn't a lot of help to be honest, but I'll get into that a little later. 
While I was trying to find out if she is was ok. I kept getting stress and having deja vu. I kept having imagines pop into my head like how I was going to be with her and how I was sitting in my bed crying and my mom walking in and I yelled, ""she is dead"". I took all that stress and turn it into something good. Finally, she sent me a facebook message telling me how she was ok and how she was on the beach with friends. I was so happy. I told her all of this and how I was planning on going back to school and other stuff. I took all this stress and use it as motivation. I enroll in GED classes to take my GED. I'm going to take my ACT too so I can go to a university. I start school on August 21st. I went back to the GYM too so far I've lost 15 pounds. July 22nd was when she finally answered on skype telling that she was ok and that she was at the beach. She also told me how she was busy since she starting college this year and she needed to get her driving license and other stuff. Again, she didn't answered until July 28. During that time, I did the same I got worry, I got stress, try to turn my life around for her. Anyways, finally on July 28 she responded saying, how can I believe she is ignoring me. That is her sister signing on/off from skype since skype turns on automatically when you first startup the computer. I havent receive any messages from her since today, August 12. I also aware that overthinking leads to negative thoughts but I just can't stop thinking about her. So, this week tuesday I believe. I went to see my results from the evaluation test and also see the professional. I was very impressed with my score since I really stopped caring about school on 8th grade, didnt paid attention in class was always day dreaming until I finally drop out on 10th grade. On reading I got 9.0 out of 10. On math I got 7.5 out of 10, it could've been better but I didn't realize what time it was so I had to guess on like 8 questions and didn't finish like 5. On language Arts I got a 5.4., basically grammar and punctuation ect. After paying what I needed to pay and enrolling in classes I went to see the professional. I told her the same thing I'm writing right now. She wasn't interested she seem in a hurry so I had to cut down part of the story. She said I didn't need medication but to start doing therapy again. Anyways, what is really worrying me at the moment is that I keep having deja vu moments. Everything feels so real and I get scared, very scared. I keep getting imagines of how I won't be with my girlfriend. Before all this happened I knew I needed to change stuff in my life but I always had games that kept my mind busy and safe. Protecting me from getting hurt, at least I think why I didn't do anything about changing earlier. Yesterday I posted a thread on /r/depression, I talked to someone told her my problems. But while I was typing my story on skype I looked at her picture and again that deja vu moment. It felt like I've seen her picture before and I got scared and start making random connections and actually believing in them. She just said it was Puberty and then I said I'm 16. I started growing hair everywhere at the age of 11. Then she said Brain Development. At first I was smiling, it felt so good talking to someone. Then I started questioning the picture of her and it all went downhill from there, I got stressed. This morning before I started making this thread I was looking into how to lucid dream. So that maybe I can ask my subconscious questions. I did reality check, pinching my forearm, asking if I'm awake, then counting my fingers, and then that is went it hit me again, fucking deja vu. Something I forgot to mention when I went to see the professional was that she asked me if she could tell my mom I smoked weed and I said yes. I thought I would share something like that to my mom. Another time I felt deja vu that I remember it clearly because it happened yesterday was that the therapist that comes to see sister and my mom was talking to my mom on the table. While I was sitting down using the laptop my mom was telling her how we smoked weed. Then it felt like deja vu. Then I started thinking about the future and how a big fight is going to happen because my mom is going to confront my sister about it. I've been trying to change the future by warning people. I told my mom not to confront my sister and I told my sister that my mom knows that we smoked weed and not to invite her friends home anymore. She got mad and told me I don't care if my mom finds out. 

This is becoming very long and I just hope someone reads because I really need answers and help. I have 2 pieces of paper and a pencil. 1 piece of paper is to right down what happens on my lucid dreams and the other I will carrying it around to write down my deja vu moments. 
My girlfriend is 18, I understand she needs her own space. I'm living a life where 3 to 5 times I feel like I've experienced this before and I scared. This is the first time I have really cared about someone and I'm really afraid of losing that person. I just don't know what to do.

PS: even while I was writing this it felt like I've done this before.
Maybe I'm believing on something really strong that I start to also believe it. I don't think that made sense.

Edit: Short Story is. 
I smoked weed, I got deja vu. I didn't know you could get deja vu from smoking weed. It scared me. I decided I needed to change my life around. I'm still having deja vu moments because im worry about my girlfriend.
Maybe it's because im more aware of things, or because im overthinking things. 
If it makes any differences, when I was a kid I hit my head many times when I was kid and bleed.
When I was like 1 year old I felt down from the bed and hit my head for the first time. But the doctor said I was fine.

[deleted],1355598979,/r/psychology/comments/14wlgn/personal_thoughts_from_a_therapist_concerning/,"(Before reading this, please be aware of my qualifications.  I graduated in 2011 with and Educational Specialist degree in Counselor Education from the University of South Carolina.  I have spent most of my career working at my University’s counseling center and working within Medicaid-funded programs with Seriously Emotional Disturbed adolescents, both within the client’s home and within the school system.  I have recently moved to Moscow, Russia where I am working as a professor at a local university. My opinions are inherently biased by my experiences and will undoubtedly retain a “sophomore” quality due to my age and experience level.  That said, my frustrations are genuine and my hope is to inspire constructive dialogue on the issue of mental-health promotion). 

Upon seeing the recent news of the shootings in Connecticut, I was unsurprised to see yet another examination of the availability of mental health services to Americans.  “Mental health professionals are hard to find!” “Privatized counseling services are too expensive!”  “Too few qualify for strictly regulated Medicaid-funded mental-health service!”  “There are too few hospital beds for the mentally-ill!”  Indeed, individuals that commit such acts are not “evil” (in whatever sense you choose to use that word); rather, they are the victims of their own biologies and environments, which, ultimately, lead them to the horrible conclusion that murdering innocents is a viable solution to whatever they have been stricken with.  It is unfortunate, however, that the United States often gets stuck on the aforementioned questions, never really considering viable solutions for the promotion of mental health care.  So, as we stand at the end of what has been another banner year for mass-shootings, let us instead consider some viable options that could promote the improvement of mental health care in the United States.  

1.  Improvement in licensure standards throughout the United States.

Upon the completion of my degree in Counselor Education, I was immediately met with the challenge of finding a supervisor and a job that would meet the standards of the state I was attempting to gain my license within (at the time it was Virginia).  It took approximately six months for the paperwork to process, by which time I had achieved a new position within a new company, sending me back to square one.  Four months after refilling my paperwork, it was expressed to me that my position did not qualify for licensure supervision due to “assessment” not being an explicit aspect of my job description.  The obvious solution would be to find a new job that did provide such an activity.  This proved to be extraordinarily difficulty as most jobs that did provide the opportunity for assessment and diagnoses were unavailable to me as they preferred licensed candidates.  The only job that DID appear to allow me to engage in the needed activities to qualify for licensing (throughout the United States) were what are called  “In-Home Therapy” jobs. So, let’s just make this clear, In-Home Therapy IS as horrible as it sounds.  I have been attacked, spit on, threatened (verbally and with weapons) which is topped off by my employers shrugging and the declaration of the fact that, “that is just what comes with the territory.”  

All of that said, I did it.  I took a second job working as an In-Home Therapist and Clinical Assessor, driving around after my 8 hour work day at a school to complete assessments and engage clients in therapy (at their homes).  Why was I doing this?  It sure as hell wasn’t for the money.  Between both jobs, I made approximately $45,000 and had a crappy HMO insurance plan.  Frankly, I did it to begin counting my work hours towards my LPC license; however, my paperwork was never processed by the Virginia Board of Counseling (at least I don’t think it was, I moved to Russia before they had a chance to get back to me on their decision to approve my job, 4 months after I had applied).  So let us recap, I’m working 70 hours a week, getting paid a crappy salary for it, and because of the hang ups at the Virginia Board of Counseling, I was never even able to count a single hour of my work experience towards my LPC.  Why is it so hard for a graduate of an accredited university (who graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA, mind you) to begin achieving his license?  If I had been able to begin my license, more jobs would have been available to me and my skills would have been available to a wider range of individuals. I may have even stayed in the counseling field if I didn’t have to jump through a series of ridiculous hoops to obtain my LPC.  Who would want to do this?   

Standardizing licensing requirements for individuals educated in Counseling would inevitably smooth this process out.  At this moment, there is not a national standard for professional licensure within the field of counseling (this excludes social work, psychiatry, and psychology). Each state has its own rules for licensure, bogging down the system in a variety of ways.  In the case of Virginia, each applicant must be considered by a board (which consisted of about two, yes, TWO people who meet once a month) to see if their application meets Virginia’s standards for the LPC or LPC-eligibility.  Wouldn’t this just be easier if all states had the same standards?  Not to mention, if I want to move to another state I then have to deal with issues of reciprocity, which may cause me to have to spend a considerable amount of money on licensing exams, extra coursework (outside of expected Continuing Education Units you must accumulate).  Is all of this time and money (did I mention that graduate school is a nice $80,000 financial set back) worth it for a crappy $45,000 a year salary?  Hell No.  

2.  Improve support for employees.
Counseling is a field that focuses entirely on supporting people. From day one of graduate school, you are told all the different ways you can help others and why it is so vital to their well being.  Surprisingly, when it comes to counselors themselves, there is little or no support offered.  For example, there are some ethical standards that state that if you feel unsafe, you do not have to work with a client. However, when your client pulls a knife on you in the second session and threatens your life alone in their home (yes, this happened), it is almost impossible to gain some protection and there is always a ready answer. Have another counselor come with you? We don’t have enough people. Meet outside the client’s home? We don’t have the space. Meet with the client with other family members present? Great, if you can get them to come. Stop seeing the client? You can try, but then you will not meet your weekly hour requirements and will receive a citation at work and a pay cut. But really, it’s up to you, we support you. 

The hypocrisy that has been built around the pay structure of Medicaid-funded counseling often leads to the abuse of the therapists themselves.  What talented and educated individual would want to work within this framework?  Yet all therapists are forced into these positions, putting themselves at-risk as a means of fulfilling productivity hours.  This is an inherent problem of the entire outpatient structure that has flowed from de-institutionalization: therapists are being put in more dangerous positions due to the demands of their employers.  Employees of PACT (a psycho-pharmaceutical oriented outpatient program) and In-Home are required to meet with seriously emotional disturbed individuals within their homes.  Again, what talented mental health professionals would want to put themselves in this position?  Where is the emphasis on security precautions for the therapist?  Could bringing back institutional care improve this situation?  Could it improve the availability of properly trained individuals (as they would now be practicing under the umbrella of a secure institution)?  Undoubtedly, all mental health professionals know the risks of working with these populations; but, could we maybe be pushing it a little too far?

3. Increasing Funding to Mental Health Care
Let me tell you about VICAP. The Virginia Independent Clinical Assessment Program is the wolf in sheep’s clothing.  On the surface, it is a measure to improve diagnoses and referrals for needed care.  In reality, it is a cost saving technique that is designed to weed out individuals that “do not meet qualifications for mental health care.”  What does a person need to do to receive Medicaid-funded services from qualified providers?  Well, first they must schedule a VICAP assessment (due to backlogs, this may take up to a month).  IF they are approved for services, they must then face ANOTHER assessment from their qualified provider.  Once this assessment is completed, Medicaid assessors scrutinize the assessment to see if the individual meets the qualifications for treatment.  All in all, an individual is looking at two assessments (lasting around and hour and a half each), scrutiny from a variety of sources, and at least a month waiting time.  Now, of course, they could go seek their own therapy and pay out of pocket ($60-$130 dollars per session, and around $200 dollars per session with a psychiatrist).  Or, they can take their HMO to their primary care physician, where they will have to receive a referral for mental health services (if there are any in their area).  Best case-scenario, an individual with his own private insurance is able to self-refer to a mental health professional.  Depending on the backlog of their local psychiatrist’s office, they could be looking at a 2-3 month waiting time to see their chosen psychiatrist.  The wait for a psychologist may be slightly shorter but the client will not be receiving the comprehensive healthcare they may require (e.g. psychotropic medication).  

So let’s recap. Mental health care is damn near impossible to get if you lack insurance.  If you have Medicaid, it is rather difficult to receive care, requiring a multitude of assessments that must be redone on a regular basis.  If you have private insurance, it is STILL difficult to receive the care you need due to mental health funding caps on private insurance AND the sheer lack of availability of mental health workers! 
So, what should be done?  Medicaid is failing the poor of the United States and increasing our country’s unmitigated mentally ill populations.  Insurance has made it difficult for individuals to receive the care they need due to funding caps and their inconsistent payouts to mental health workers (certain diagnoses can be denied by insurance companies).  And, frankly, the mental health industry is failing the mentally ill due to poor licensing standards and the lack of proper financial compensation for talented workers.  

Going back to the thing that started this conversation – sadly, nothing can be done.  We cannot undo the shooting and save people who were lost. The only thing we can do is try to bring about a positive change.  The tragedy cannot be stopped once the shooter walks in a school, it has to be prevented long before that.  After so many recent instances of such tragedies, it is deeply saddening that nothing seems to be changing, but perhaps this terrible tragedy can at least serve as a much needed wake-up call.

drkoolman,1355627835,/r/psychology/comments/14xbbt/thoughts_from_a_therapist_on_mental_health/,"(Before reading this, please be aware of my qualifications. I graduated in 2011 with and Educational Specialist degree in Counselor Education from the University of South Carolina. I have spent most of my career working at my University’s counseling center and working within Medicaid-funded programs with Seriously Emotional Disturbed adolescents, both within the client’s home and within the school system. I have recently moved to Moscow, Russia where I am working as a professor at a local university. My opinions are inherently biased by my experiences and will undoubtedly retain a “sophomore” quality due to my age and experience level. That said, my frustrations are genuine and my hope is to inspire constructive dialogue on the issue of mental-health promotion).

Upon seeing the recent news of the shootings in Connecticut, I was unsurprised to see yet another examination of the availability of mental health services to Americans. “Mental health professionals are hard to find!” “Privatized counseling services are too expensive!” “Too few qualify for strictly regulated Medicaid-funded mental-health service!” “There are too few hospital beds for the mentally-ill!” Indeed, individuals that commit such acts are not “evil” (in whatever sense you choose to use that word); rather, they are the victims of their own biologies and environments, which, ultimately, lead them to the horrible conclusion that murdering innocents is a viable solution to whatever they have been stricken with. It is unfortunate, however, that the United States often gets stuck on the aforementioned questions, never really considering viable solutions for the promotion of mental health care. So, as we stand at the end of what has been another banner year for mass-shootings, let us instead consider some viable options that could promote the improvement of mental health care in the United States.

Improvement in licensure standards throughout the United States.

Upon the completion of my degree in Counselor Education, I was immediately met with the challenge of finding a supervisor and a job that would meet the standards of the state I was attempting to gain my license within (at the time it was Virginia). It took approximately six months for the paperwork to process, by which time I had achieved a new position within a new company, sending me back to square one. Four months after refilling my paperwork, it was expressed to me that my position did not qualify for licensure supervision due to “assessment” not being an explicit aspect of my job description. The obvious solution would be to find a new job that did provide such an activity. This proved to be extraordinarily difficulty as most jobs that did provide the opportunity for assessment and diagnoses were unavailable to me as they preferred licensed candidates. The only job that DID appear to allow me to engage in the needed activities to qualify for licensing (throughout the United States) were what are called “In-Home Therapy” jobs. So, let’s just make this clear, In-Home Therapy IS as horrible as it sounds. I have been attacked, spit on, threatened (verbally and with weapons) which is topped off by my employers shrugging and the declaration of the fact that, “that is just what comes with the territory.”

All of that said, I did it. I took a second job working as an In-Home Therapist and Clinical Assessor, driving around after my 8 hour work day at a school to complete assessments and engage clients in therapy (at their homes). Why was I doing this? It sure as hell wasn’t for the money. Between both jobs, I made approximately $45,000 and had a crappy HMO insurance plan. Frankly, I did it to begin counting my work hours towards my LPC license; however, my paperwork was never processed by the Virginia Board of Counseling (at least I don’t think it was, I moved to Russia before they had a chance to get back to me on their decision to approve my job, 4 months after I had applied). So let us recap, I’m working 70 hours a week, getting paid a crappy salary for it, and because of the hang ups at the Virginia Board of Counseling, I was never even able to count a single hour of my work experience towards my LPC. Why is it so hard for a graduate of an accredited university (who graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA, mind you) to begin achieving his license? If I had been able to begin my license, more jobs would have been available to me and my skills would have been available to a wider range of individuals. I may have even stayed in the counseling field if I didn’t have to jump through a series of ridiculous hoops to obtain my LPC. Who would want to do this?

Standardizing licensing requirements for individuals educated in Counseling would inevitably smooth this process out. At this moment, there is not a national standard for professional licensure within the field of counseling (this excludes social work, psychiatry, and psychology). 

Each state has its own rules for licensure, bogging down the system in a variety of ways. In the case of Virginia, each applicant must be considered by a board (which consisted of about two, yes, TWO people who meet once a month) to see if their application meets Virginia’s standards for the LPC or LPC-eligibility. Wouldn’t this just be easier if all states had the same standards? Not to mention, if I want to move to another state I then have to deal with issues of reciprocity, which may cause me to have to spend a considerable amount of money on licensing exams, extra coursework (outside of expected Continuing Education Units you must accumulate). Is all of this time and money (did I mention that graduate school is a nice $80,000 financial set back) worth it for a crappy $45,000 a year salary? Hell No.

Improve support for employees.

 Counseling is a field that focuses entirely on supporting people. From day one of graduate school, you are told all the different ways you can help others and why it is so vital to their well being. Surprisingly, when it comes to counselors themselves, there is little or no support offered. For example, there are some ethical standards that state that if you feel unsafe, you do not have to work with a client. However, when your client pulls a knife on you in the second session and threatens your life alone in their home (yes, this happened), it is almost impossible to gain some protection and there is always a ready answer. Have another counselor come with you? We don’t have enough people. Meet outside the client’s home? We don’t have the space. Meet with the client with other family members present? Great, if you can get them to come. Stop seeing the client? You can try, but then you will not meet your weekly hour requirements and will receive a citation at work and a pay cut. But really, it’s up to you, we support you.

The hypocrisy that has been built around the pay structure of Medicaid-funded counseling often leads to the abuse of the therapists themselves. What talented and educated individual would want to work within this framework? Yet all therapists are forced into these positions, putting themselves at-risk as a means of fulfilling productivity hours. This is an inherent problem of the entire outpatient structure that has flowed from de-institutionalization: therapists are being put in more dangerous positions due to the demands of their employers. Employees of PACT (a psycho-pharmaceutical oriented outpatient program) and In-Home are required to meet with seriously emotional disturbed individuals within their homes. Again, what talented mental health professionals would want to put themselves in this position? Where is the emphasis on security precautions for the therapist? Could bringing back institutional care improve this situation? Could it improve the availability of properly trained individuals (as they would now be practicing under the umbrella of a secure institution)? Undoubtedly, all mental health professionals know the risks of working with these populations; but, could we maybe be pushing it a little too far?

iactuallyredditalot,1304193672,/r/AskReddit/comments/h0zhu/reddit_cps_took_my_kids_and_wont_give_them_back/,"Hi, Reddit. Throwaway here because OMG stigma and horror. I am a single mom with two grade school kids. I live in a relatively wealthy district (Babylon Village, NY) and both my kids have some difficulties remaining organized and completing homework due to ADHD.

Back in February, my daughter and I watched the new Romeo + Juliet on Netflix together. Later that week, she was bullied by a group of kids at recess and she said something to the effect of she wanted to kill herself, we believe to get the kids to leave her alone. (She's 8.) This set off a horrific chain of events that has no seeming end.

At the time, the school suspended her indefinitely. They called me, but I was in a meeting and missed the call. Recess is close to dismissal, so I only found out both my kids had been kept at school and not sent on the bus when they didn't get home. School reaction was swift and confused. Initially, they suspended her, then they suspended her from the bus, then they said she couldn't come back until she had a psychiatric evaluation. THEN they said their Special Ed coordinator was on vacation, and they couldn't schedule a psychiatric evaluation, so just send her back. I met with the principal, the counselor and the school psychologist who recommended counseling and said as soon as the SEC got back from vacation, they'd schedule the psych eval.

I told them my daughter's father was in the process of getting us health insurance and I couldn't pay for a counselor out of pocket. They gave me a list of local counselors I couldn't afford. I asked if the kids (somehow my son got dragged into this) could be counseled through the school until we had insurance. They said no. (After the kids were taken, they offered it because CPS asked and I balked- why let the kids get taken for no insurance/no counseling when they could easily offer it all along?)

Once a week, the school would email me and ask if we had a counselor yet. Once a week, I said we still hadn't gotten insurance and couldn't afford a counselor. (Literally- I have $48 in the bank right now, counselors won't work on IOUs.) This went on throughout March- about three weeks. Finally, the school decided that since we hadn't yet gotten counseling, my kids were being abused. They took them into separate rooms to investigate and under questioning, my daughter mentioned eventually she had tantrums at home. During one kicking/punching tantrum, I picked up a pillow to block her punches. (She sounds out of control, but she just has ODD- when she gets mad, she gets infuriated.) 

During another, she was ricocheting off the walls in our hallway and I held her arms down because she was banging the walls. The school, on a lengthy list of complaints about things like missed homework and insufficient school supplies, told CPS I smothered her with a pillow on a daily basis to prevent her from breathing as a form of punishment. This is so far from the truth I have to believe it was an intentional misconstruance, but I do not know why.

WHAT THE FUCK. So this was March 22. On March 31, CPS came to my door to examine my house but I wasn't in. When I got home, my neighbor told me CPS left a card with her and a message to tell me they're looking for me. I called back the next day, but in the interim read about it on the internet. All advice was to not let CPS in without a warrant- anything they saw was ""grounds"" to take the kids and I should wait until they have a warrant, so I did. I arranged a meeting with a CPS investigator in a local Starbucks to answer his questions.

We met the next day and there were no questions- any explanation I had (for why we didn't get counseling, for instance) was an ""excuse."" He read off the list of complaints and interrogated me for five hours. I told him I would ask a lawyer about letting them in because once you let them in, they can come in any time for any reason. He said this was another ""red flag"" and said, ""if you have nothing to hide, you should just let me in."" I still wanted to ask a lawyer. He told me CPS knew I worked a lot (I work at home) and that I spend ""all night typing on the computer."" That my kids had gone to a ""free thinking school,"" and he rolled his eyes. (They went to a free school for a while, similar to the Brooklyn Free School.) He said over and over that I ""did nothing"" after my daughter was recommended counseling, when in actuality, I took her for the psych eval and was waiting for the school to release the results to us.

Monday he called me and said they were going to summon me to court that day for a ""temporary ban on corporal punishment."" They called my husband (we are separated but close friends and raising the kids together amicably) and said there was no need for him to come- the action was against me and he was over an hour away at the time of the call, an hour before the hearing.

My dad finally found the summons, which was stuck under our deck. It had the information, info we would have needed to go to the correct place at the correct time. My parents and an aunt accompanied me at 2pm at family court, and at 4:30, the law guardian appointed for my kids asked where they were. The CPS worker told me to arrange a sitter, so I had. My parents were advised at this time (4:32pm) to go retrieve the kids. At 4:35, after my parents left, they called the hearing.

The CPS lawyer said that my children were being smothered with pillows on a daily basis, and were in imminent risk of death. They said since no one was there to take custody (my parents were asked to leave) they would like to move to immediately put my kids in foster care. (This is a process that takes 6-9 months to amend if everything goes correctly.) My aunt stood up and said she was there and could serve as their legal guardian. CPS grudgingly allowed my aunt to take custody of the children. When my sister dropped the kids off at school the next day, the school's secretary said in front of my children, ""why are they here? I thought they were going to live with their father in Brooklyn."" Why would a secretary a) know this, and b) say it in front of two terrified kids?

Since that date, we have had 7 hearings. At each, CPS comes up with a new demand for me to ""meet"" before they will ""look at"" the case again. Just yesterday, after the sixth request, they admitted they hadn't even reviewed my father as a guardian for the kids. Court briefly adjourned and they made a 2 minute phone call to ""clear"" him. It seems like they have no incentive to move the case forward and reunite our family. The newest demand is that I have a psychiatric evaluation at my expense because there ""could"" be a reason I need one, even though there is no indication or history that this is necessary. My crystal ball tells me that regardless of how the psychiatric evaluation goes, the request will be I get counseling anyway, and we ""see"" how it goes.

At each hearing we have had, the judge and lawyer have said reunification is only a possibility if I get health insurance for me and my kids, something I have been trying to do for a long time. We are technically eligible for our state's Child Health Plus, but have been denied medicaid. I cannot understand how this can be. How can a court demand I have health insurance? Obviously I would love to have it but it has so far been out of reach for our family. I am currently homeless because my dad is staying at my house with my kids- I couch surf and try to find places to stay but I can't afford two places at once. I realize my resultant homelessness is no concern of the court's, but my kids are terrified I have to leave and my son spent two nights in the ER (they only medical care we can get) on morphine because he is having stomach aches and panic attacks we think are from the whole affair. He was screaming in pain for 7 hours straight. :( And I had to leave him in the hospital, because CPS says no overnights, no matter what.

Reddit, I know this is a long and convoluted story and I probably sound like a bad mom. I love my kids, and they are well taken care of. I don't make a lot of money (I am a full-time web writer) but I do what I do to stay home with them. We have a nice life that we worked so hard to rebuild after I split up with their dad. I can't help but feel our vulnerability is what attracted CPS to us- they know we cannot fight them, and everything I have seen of the court is just rubber-stamping CPS demands on families that really do not need their services. (CPS has said time and again they cannot help us obtain counseling.) 

I may not be the most conventional mom- sometimes we go out for midnight milkshakes or watch zombie movies and I answer questions honestly when they ask- but I am a dedicated and full-time mom. I don't date. I don't go out much if at all. All I do is ""mom.""

My kids are all I have. I don't know what to do. If I had a normal job, like my old one, I would have been fired already with 7 full-day unscheduled absences. My family is one of the many teetering on the brink of financial ruin and it is only constant hard work that keeps it together. Is there any media/advocacy group you know of that deals with lack of health insurance? A single parenting action group? I can't imagine any family could get through this intact unless they have serious bank and an excellent lawyer- my $48 in the bank won't get that. :(

**TL;DR: The school complained about my parenting and CPS took my kids. The complaint was deliberately and falsely worded to remove the kids and I cannot get them back. I am at my wits end with this process and only a month in, and my kids are having nightmares and vomiting all night when I leave. Please advise?**",AskReddit,"Reddit, CPS took my kids and won't give them back until I have health insurance- details within, help?

6LACKFRIDAY,1574106128,/r/AskReddit/comments/dy88dy/was_i_considered_raped_as_a_male_is_this/,"So I’m going to try and share this story the best that I can. I was pretty drunk all night but I remember a bunch of bits and pieces.

So I am a straight black male (I would say I’m pretty attractive overall). I have a girlfriend whom I love and care for very much. But she is currently in military bootcamp so I’m not able to tell her the current situation.

this past Saturday night on NOV 16th, I was invited to go out to a club downtown with a friend of mine from school (she is a girl, I’ll call her Jin for the sake of the story). I told her that I was willing to go out with them cuz I hadn’t been out in a while. Since my girlfriend isn’t here right now and I can’t hang with her, I figured I would just go out and try to enjoy myself and get my mind off of everything.

So It was me, Jin, Jin’s wife (we’ll call her Monica), Jin’s sister (we’ll call her Jessica), Jin’s sister’s friend (we’ll call her Tess), and another dude (we’ll call him Jake). So there was 6 of us total. Jin told me we were all gonna meet at Tess’ step dad’s house so we could all pregame before going out cuz alcohol gets so expensive. I arrived over there not too long after I received the info from her. It was my first time meeting everybody (besides Jin). everybody seemed cool and down to earth so I didn’t think much of anything and was just gonna have a good night.

I drank two Lagunitas IPAs and two shots before we all left the house. I was already feelin pretty good and I was ready to have a good night dancin my ass off. Our DD for the night was Monica because she told us she doesn’t like drinking. About 30 minutes later we got to the club. It was about 10:00 If I remember correctly, and we all had another shot as soon as we got there. About 15 minutes in, Monica said she was tryna leave (party pooping I guess you could say, but she doesn’t usually go out much so it’s understandable). Jin decided that she was just gonna go home with her wife and then come back later that same night. I said okay cool and told her I would see her again later. So now it’s just me, Jessica, Tess and Jake there.

We were all having a good time. Tess was dancin with a bunch of different people, Jake was chillin for most of the night, and I was dancing by myself for most of the night. Jessica kept trying to dance with me all night and was giving me these googly eyes. She also kept trying to kiss me. You could definitely tell she was into me and trying to get something going. It was obvious on my face that i wasn’t trying to do anything with her and she knew that, but she stayed persistent the whole night trying to make it seem like “we were together”. I made it VERY CLEAR to her that I already had a girlfriend that I loved and cared about but it seemed like it just went in one ear and out the other. She kept grabbing me and trying to go dance but I kept resisting. I wasn’t trying to make a scene or be rude because I didn’t want to embarrass anybody. Usually whenever I go out, I’m the type of guy that likes to take care of the group and make sure everybody gets home safe. That’s just how I am. I think I adopted that trait from being in the military and always taking care of my people whenever we go out. So even though I wasn’t interested in her, doesn’t mean I wasn’t gonna take care of her and make sure she got home safe like I was planning to do with everybody else.

About an hour later Jin comes back. I’m assuming her wife dropped her back off or she grabbed an Uber back because she didn’t have the car with her. We all were just having a good time. Keep in mind Jessica is still trying to hook up with me all night. Around 12:30am or so we all grabbed another shot And we went on to dance till about 1:30. Club closes at 2 so we got out of there a bit early so we didn’t have to deal with traffic. At this point we were waiting outside for the Uber driver, everybody seemed pretty drunk, especially me. I should have controlled my liquor intake a bit better that night but this had been my first time drinking in a while, and it was also my first time drinking on a vegan diet. I believe the alcohol got to me quicker than it usually does because of that. Usually I’m able to handle the amount of alcohol I had pretty easily. But that night it was definitely hitting me.

Our Uber driver finally comes and we all hop in the car and head back to Tess’ step dad’s house so we could all crash. I was in the front seat and everybody else got in the back. I was up for like the first 10 minutes then I blacked out and fell asleep the rest of the ride. I think everybody pretty much drunk off their ass except for Jin who wasn’t that drunk to begin with. 

Last thing I remember from that point on was that I woke up in a pitch dark room, (still drunk out of my mind) and I couldn’t see jack shit. My shoes were off, my phone was nowhere to be found, and my pants were around my knees and Somebody was sucking me off. I didn’t even know who it was, but I made an educated enough guess to say it was Jessica that was doing it. Especially after I heard her moan. I could tell by the tone of her moan that it was her voice. I was in and out of consciousness while all this was happening, I don’t remember if I said anything or if I was hard or not, or if i nutted or if I touched her or any of that shit. All I remember was that I woke up with Jessica literally sucking me off. It was pitch dark, I didn’t know where tf I was, I was drunk off my ass, and I didn’t know what to do. So I froze up and just let it happen. I wasn’t even sure if it was real or not. I couldn’t believe what was happening.

I remember at some point that same night, I got up to use the restroom, still in the pitch black darkness, I literally had to walk with my hands out like a blind man because my phone was nowhere to be found so I couldn’t use the flashlight. The only way I was able to find out where I was going was when somebody else got up to use the restroom and I could see a faint bathroom light. I followed the light and when they came out, it was Jake, who then just went straight to another room and closed the door. After I used the restroom I was still wayyyyy entirely too drunk, so I found a carpet floor and slept on it. 

Next thing I knew, I was woken up  by Jin. I was on the floor (it was around 7:30 in the morning so the sunrise bright enough to where I could see everything) and I had a MASSIVE hangover. Jin, Jessica, and Jake were all up, I don’t remember where everybody slept but I know me, Jin, and Jessica left, but Jake stayed and locked the door behind us. I said bye to Jin, but Jessica didn’t even look my way at all during the whole interaction. It was like she was guilty about something. So from that point I knew that I wasn’t trippin and something happened that night.

Later that morning, as I was trying to piece everything together still, I decided to confront Jessica about it through Jin (because I didn’t have her number, thank god) and told Jin to pass the word on. Jessica basically admitted that she was a bit drunk and did what she did last night. I told Jessica that i could go to the cops about it but i wasn’t going to because I didn’t want to ruin her life. I got Jessica to admit it to Jin and then Jin told me that Jessica said, “apologizes deeply but didn’t remember what she did” I mentioned when I confronted her that she didn’t have my consent do any of what she did. And I even told her all night, VERY CLEARLY, that I have a girlfriend and was not interested in any way shape or form in her. Jin mentioned that Jessica said, “she remembered that apparently i kept pushing her head down to keep going.”  But there is NO WAY out of my own willingness to do so, that after all I said to her that night, I wake super extremely drunk in pitch darkness, not knowing where tf I am, and having my pants around my ankles getting my dick sucked by a somebody I was CLEARLY not interested in ALL NIGHT. I feel like I was clearly taken advantage of in this situation.

I was extremely upset on my way home that morning because I had nobody to talk to, and I couldn’t believe wtf happened. I want to tell my girlfriend but idk how to tell her, and more importantly I can’t even tell her anything till she graduates bootcamp. She graduates later this week and I’m flying over to see her graduate. But I don’t know whether I should tell her on her big graduation day or if I should just wait until a better time. I don’t even know what her reaction is gonna be. It’s all just extremely bad timing.....It makes me feel like I can’t trust anybody now like that. Especially if I drink, And Especially if I don’t know who I’m going out with. 

Sorry the story is so long, I just tried to make the story as clear as possible. 

So based on all of this information, was I raped by this girl? Did I cheat? And what should I do in this situation?

I think I’m handling the situation very well, better than most people. It’s just hard to believe that me as a male was taken advantage of like that. I also feel like a lot of my masculinity has been taken from me.

Anything helps! Thank you!",AskReddit,Was I considered raped as a male? Is this considered cheating?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dy88dy/was_i_considered_raped_as_a_male_is_this/,1574127728.0,school is too expensive,12.08
Next_Chemistry_2846,1653629341,/r/college/comments/uyr0ul/confession_whats_your_thoughts/,"My anxiety kills me . I wake up every morning in the state of a panic attack , feeling  a terrible  pain inside of my  chest literally.  I sweat and my whole body is shaking . What is more I have pains and especially headaches and  gsstrenterical problems, my low abdominal hurts really much.  I'm so sad and can't concentrate that I done even take my heart pills ( arrhythmias ) and during the day while I'm sitting or standing I feel a presure in my head ,my heart starts beating very fast and my sight bloors and I geek like finding but I manage to stay still and avoid that . I've been experiencing these things for 4 months now after having to choose major in college ( in my country thr system says that according to the subjects we have access to certain studies and we have to choose it before sitting exams). So that's my story a 19 year old who said that she would be a doctor since their 15 ; however she wasn't good at physics / chemistry, / maths , but she still chose them in ordrt to keep her opportunities open.  She did got good grades at school with help of professors , but on the exams of the subjects she was not good at she always got under 10 put of 20 . She  started feeling that she won't survive and that she is stupid comparing to most of their classmates who were like fuckijf ainstsins on these subjects . Then covid hit and also a brake up with the same person that I loved since a kid and hurt me severly by ghosting me and breaking up with me all the time because of distance.  I felt ugly, problematic and not deserved to be loved at my 16 when we were on covid I was everyday in my bed crying and trying to understand what is wrong with me why I was treated like a rubbish like a girl used only to have fun With .. I focused on ..making myself looking more attractive an digested that I'm just stupid  for school . I was doing bad and felt like  there's no way no way literally I could learn these things and become good at them it felt so boring and late . After one year I was homeschooling couldn't pay attention I learned nothing I was  fed up and so bored and remained so cocially alone and my bf was making our with someone else while j was home depending on his affection and attention to feel a human... I changed subjects last year without giving it much thought  i had the need to score really high even on easy subjects to feel smart ,to feel that I'm not useless that I can do something well.  Well no 4 months ago I was asked to fill my uni entrance exams and I realised that I could only go for psychology speech pathology and teaching...  I've our them all to pass one .. instead tho I prefer to pass away... I can't believe what an idiot I'm for not even trying for med I don't belive that i chosed the easy path to get a good high school diploma score , which is now going to be avarage since due to my breakdowns I failed the high school examinations.  I feel so useless and traped in my mistake non of the fields I have for option fills my heart and u think non of them is going to feed me in the future.  I had also the chance of going to one country abroad for biomedice or physical therapy but my parents cut me .. only dad works and they are arguing even for going to the supermarket ..  not to help me financially srudy abroad or in  a private college.  I am devastated honestly I can't accept that I know I could be better than that... yeahh I admit I did shit in sciences and did not study them effectively after seeing how dumb am with maths and what scores I got MY MISTAKE .. I don't want to pay for that 🥺I don't want to be one of those persons who end up being in misery doing nothing.  They force me to go in the public university of my country with one of the above option s, they tell me that I'm a 19 already old ,and uselssed stupid Shame ..that they were telling me not to change majors and I did not listen my mind was on the bf ... 😢I don't knkw what to do now I'm left alone I have no friends and no one to socialize with  the person who hurt me is going to study engineering and di his life abroad, whike I will be jn my parents home studying something that is going tk give ne no job . I'm so weak so unsolvable and so broke .. I can't see good in my future.  I didn't even sit the exams for uni ( there next week ) I didn't even studied and run the risk of passing no where ... I feel guilt I even thought of staying hone and only srudy kne year thescienced I suck at to try for medice next year although I know I want pass , I even thought if there's anyway to study abroad med without breaking having a diploma with physics and chemistry on it ... I  even thought of trying hard and I imagine my self being a doctor and dream about it .. then I wake up and reallise that I'm stuck I want tk vomit I ruined my future for some stupid guys who are going to be perfect.  I have no financial support my dad has cancer and he was the only one working  , my mum has heart problems and they are also fighting every day for if my dad wasn't sick they would have  broken up, since my dad's behavior is a torture he screams because eat what he brings home he  screams if er don't have a shower Ata fix hour he laughs and makes us feel stupid for expressing ourselves... I feel bad to speak in front of them and that caused me many traumas fear of abandonment , social anxiety feeling of needing tk Excell. I also developed perfectionism syndrome and instead of becoming the best I totally failed because of the avarage u couldn't take and jumped into a useless major . Honestly I feel stupid for searching for medicine whike they are so bright and smart kn sciences people put there , I also feek stupid for my thought of giving everything up and don't enroll to the public universityeven if I pass , work at cafes earn some money and  sit them again next year and go for biomedice or smth ..  I feel stupid for being afraid I feek stupid for really being afraid not to enroll in uni and stay like that at all I'm afraid of my parents actions they wait for me to pass so much in order not to have to pay a singe cent for me anymore.. they told me ai fucked up I stupid and I should accept how much I messed  they told me that  I should just take a degree in order to be less useless when searching for random jobs . And what is more I'm also feeling stuck in this country due to a loved person who I can't just abandon ; he us the person who knows my true self and the person who stood by me knowing all the shits of my life, whike I was running over someone else and dreamed of going to that country to study with him  ( the person who hurt me at 16 ) I know it's stupid but I feel so attracted to yhr person who broke my heart but at the same time I can't leave the person who stood by me though the hekk of it because I know that those people are hard to find and I'm grateful for having him ... and I know that relationship from distant is not working out and if I go abroad I'm going to run over the one who manipulated me but can't get him out of mind ( the one who is going to study engineering) .. Anyway,my biggest concern guys is that I really feel hopeless and stuck I recognize I've made a mistake but I don't want to be defined by it I don't want to ruin my whole life I know how hard it is I was late to understand what is going on in this hotibble world we are living and I'm willing to work and achieve and Survive ... but I don't knkw what to do I want to finally take care of my needs of my brain and knowledge and i feel is so late I did not had a good doundation in high dchokl in order to be able to study something worthy... I'm stupid for dreaming a medical school although I would love it .. and stupid for wanting to go abroad and at the same time kept here for a person I love ... I'm aslo stupid for dreaming other things whike I didn't even sit exams and I want to die again ... I don't knkw what to do once I pass I don't want my parents to suffer either they already feel ashamed.  I don't knkw what to do guys I'm lost the worst thing is that I dknr have a certain goal I just know i like health related studies and have no idea of finance ..computer and etc . I really want tk do something for me to feel human again , I want to succeed to build the life I've never had * not to become wealthy, but to have a respectful life and not struggling paying the bills like my parents:( .... I don't knkw what do do everything feels so wrong I know it's my fault but what to do dam  😢😢😢I'm really sorry for this post I needed to speak somewhere my feeling.. I'm getting literally sick from this and right now u feek again like fainting     ... I don't jnjw what to do .. I dream of becoming good whike I'm so abarage and in such shitty position .

this_times_for_real,1307637048,/r/AskReddit/comments/hvmc1/reddit_what_items_for_less_than_1_can_you_buy/,"This is a repost of a comment I made.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hv32a/reddit_what_items_for_less_than_100_can_you_buy/c1ypos6

----------------------------------------

If any engineering brains at Reddit want to make a contribution to global society, reword the question:

&gt; Reddit, what items, for less than $1, can you buy that will greatly increase your quality of life?

Setting aside the absolutely poor, the billion or so living under tarps without drinking water, there remain billions more living on a couple dollars a day.  What this phrase ""less than a/2 dollar/s"" a day misses is the power of those few dollars.  You cannot imagine living without your 50$ shower head, but entire families can survive on a couple dollars a day outside the developed world.  Food and services can be extremely cheap.  Imagine a whole family eating (barely) adequate for a month on about 25$.  Yes it's possible. 

Even so, these ""aspiring"" classes -so-called because they fit somewhere between absolute poverty and the middle class- live without lots of things you would consider basic to a good life.  Most can afford a few appliances.  People will buy a cell phone, a radio, a TV, then a fan, then (more rarely) a fridge or (even more rarely) a washing machine.  Rarely do you see all these appliances in one house.  Nobody can afford AC because of the cost of electricity. 

The price of these appliances hover around $100-150 and represent family investments.  There is barely any secondary market, because nothing is thrown away.  Somewhere in your neighborhood, somebody fixes it, and so you fix it and fix it, for years until the bitter end.  

They don't buy books, except textbooks which are badly written and printed by the government.  These will come in somewhere between $1-5 each.  You will never find any other book.  Not even a phone book.  The children of the household may be the second generation to attend school, and the only literature they read are these shoddy school textbooks, which they memorize.  There is no local library.  Most libraries are private, and restrict access.  Nobody knows where the libraries are, or how to get there.

There is no shower, and no common water supply.  Water comes from a well that is undrinkable, pulled up by electric pump to the roof.  You empty it into a bucket, then dump it on your head.  The bucket costs about $2.  Once or twice a week, the city will pump drinking water, with which you fill buckets.  Miss your chance and you don't have any water.  Spend $2 on a large bottle of mineral water.

For many, there will be no private space, except the bathroom.  Everyone lives, eats, and sleeps in one or two rooms.  It's two or three to a bed. if there is a bed.  Most people sleep on concrete with a mat or thin blanket.  There is no ""me"" time before you go to sleep.

We all know about Chinese made plastic crap.  Now realize that your Chinese plastic crap was the creme de la creme of plastic crap.  Only the best for America.  In the second world you will be surprised how little plastic is required for a straw, how materials in general can be stretched to the limit of plausibility to produce a salable object.  There is a huge market that can pay *almost* nothing, and it's served.  It turns out people living on 2 dollars a day drink with straws at the movie theater, too.  They don't sit under a tarp lamenting out of a toothless mouth.  Those people make less than one dollar a day.

Much of the world doesn't use toilet paper, which saves a lot of money.  It is also quite sanitary when good soap is available, which it almost never is in a public place, like a restaurant or train station.  It may surprise you, but toilet paper is not first on the list of expenses to upgrade as the aspiring class climbs the ladder.  The pipes can't handle it.  Shifting would be a huge infrastructural expense that nobody can afford.

People might know about the Internet, but they don't know how to use it.  Kids use the local Internet cafe to play Grand Theft Auto.  The network will be spotty, electricity shutting off regularly due to city-wide brownouts.  The net will be understood mainly as a place to obtain movies, music, and pornography, or to Skype with a relative working in some far away place.  Wikipedia, Google and Twitter might as well not exist for most of them; Facebook has slightly better penetration.  Email is understood to be a magical counterpart to SMS if it is known at all.  Nobody has a webpage or knows how to code HTML.  Lots of families simply can't afford the few coins it costs to use the services.

There might be a 2% penetration of computers at home, with few able to spend more for Internet, which will inevitably be horrendously slow.  Anyone who actually becomes an engineer moves far away to pursue their success.  Almost nobody who knows how to use a computer lives in the area.  Everyone will tell you earnestly they want to become a computer engineer, but almost nobody has really used a computer.  For many, their first year of engineering college will be the first time sitting in front of a machine for a substantial amount of time.

This comment serves to merely scratch the surface of everyday life in a second-world context.  Anyone who had a real interest in thinking about product engineering for the second world would have to live there.  Each place will have its own cultural and technological geography.

----------------------------------------

Still, I imagine there is a *general case* worth pursuing here:

**Here's my suggestion for a Reddit-relevant fantasy product for ""less than 100$"" that would be a great boon to this class of people.**

**Can an extremely cheap electronic device be created that leverages the fact most of these households have, or will have, a TV?  How much of the cost can be offloaded?  Amazing would be a USB-hub sized flash-based ""computer"" with a TV out and wifi, stuffed with free software and ALL THE PIRATED BOOKS SATAN CAN STORE ON 2 GB.**

There is one product I can find sold out of China for 68$.  But 68$ is at least half a month's wages for many.  It needs to be less.  It needs to be between $20 and $40.  Closer to $20.

Western geeks have their hand-helds, their plug computers, and other geekery, but they lack the real life experience that would enable them to imagine the technological possibilities of the second-world, and not merely its limitations.  They don't realize how revolutionary a tailored device would be in a far off place.  They think in terms of the evolution of tech in the West (desktop-laptop-handheld) without realizing this evolution has not and likely will never take place in the second world.  

Another difficulty is the near-complete lack of knowledge of the supply-chain existing in the second-world, and of the capabilities of local workers.  A Westerner will naturally price his products incredibly high, because he is used to paying a lot.  He will not be able to imagine an *ad hoc* product, built from junk, soldered together in a local shop the size of a walk-in closet for 2 cents a piece.(1)  He will not take into account the illicit trade in electronics parts which forms the backbone of off- and fake-brand electronics and appliances.  A Westerner will source his boards from a website in the English language.  But this is not how people who live on $2 a day manage to survive, and indeed thrive in many cases.  They cut corners, until the square fits into the circle.  Can we do that?

If we really believe in open source, in a world made more democratic through the application of technology, Western geeks need to put a lot more thought into the realities of living in the second-world.  Technology is not an equalizer, it is a cultural accelerant, and billions of people are being left in the dust, while Western geeks ponder the value of their $50 shower heads.

----------------------------------------

*(1) To give you some idea of labor costs in the second world, my local print shop *silk screened by hand* each and every of a thousand business card order I made, for about $10 *including materials*.  The process required two people, one to lift and drop the silk screen, and the other to ink, adjust and print the card.*

----------------------------------------

**EDIT:** There are projects to bring computing to the second and third world.  One Laptop Per Child project, Simputer, and other attempts have all faltered.  The latest hyped project, the Indian government's 35$ tablet Sakshat, has been delayed.   In case you are interested, some links.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simputer

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakshat

All these initiatives seem to suck from the same giant cock: they're all essentially private projects.  When they fail, nobody gains anything from the effort.(2, 3)  Nobody learns anything except, ""Gee, making a cheap computing device is hard!""  They have proven they aren't up to the job, and disappear once the money and moralfag enthusiasm runs out.  We'll see about the Sakshat.

VIA has an interesting project, essentially tailoring technology for the second world context.  VIA's initiative will probably survive simply because it is based on economics of an emerging consumer market.  Still, it's products are out of range for the average person living on 2 dollars a day.  Its marketing is directed at well funded NGOs, I think.

http://www.via.com.tw/en/initiatives/empowered/

What would be really revolutionary is the following:

1. Open source plans, so anyone can produce it, learn from it, contribute to it.
2. Use of the cheapest, found, and unlikely source materials.  Can we turn one man's junk into another man's technology gold?
3. Use of hobbyist 3d printers to produce as much of the body as possible, to match required precision with local fabrication.
4. Something cool and viral that can take care of itself and increase geek-knowledge, rather than a polished dumb-user product mediated by NGOs or governments as handouts.

What we want is not a client base (social worker mentality), or consumer base (capitalist mentality), but a geek base, a generation of second world geeks who can take hold of their own situation to bring the open network home.  

This is a link to open source hardware.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware

----------------------------------------

(2) Simputer was supposedly open source hardware, but 
(3) This is where Stallman was wrong in 1999, when he said ""I see no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software.""  Openness creates the social platform from which to build and derive socially valuable technologies.

I will also avoid any symbolism of me or my spouses gender to avoid any sort of gender specific backlash or opinion influencing.

Also this is going to be LONG… I really need advice but am willing to let this be a get it off my chest moment as well.

For years, my spouse and I have struggled to stay afloat, and I’ve always tried to avoid fighting about money, because I know it’s doesn’t solve any problems and only creates a blame game.  I lost my job last year and I’ve been lucky to even have found a new job, albeit a bit less pay, but work none the less.

A couple weeks ago my spouse tried to bring up our bills and I abruptly stopped them and said that I don’t want to talk about it.  And that if we can’t pay our bills then we need to consider a bankruptcy.

The thought of bankruptcy bothers us because we feel like we should have to be responsible for our actions, even though more recently it’s not about extravagant things on credit cards, it’s been needs to get by.  Rather than fighting about it I’ve been proactive and done things like call the card companies and ask them to close the account and lower or interest rate with a pay-off plan.  Also had both vehicles refi’d to a lower rate saving us hundreds of dollars.  Started working the late shift to make more money (even though I never get to see my family anymore) and found other modes of transportation saving us hundreds of dollars on gas so far this year.  

The past spring we had a vehicle blow the head gasket.  It sat parked in our driveway all summer because we knew that we couldn’t afford to fix it.  About a month ago I realized that one of our local tire shops takes the credit card of a furniture store in the area and decided that was the only means by which we would ever get it fixed.

$3200 later we now have a working vehicle, but it had started a raging battle between the two of us.

Ever since that vehicle has been driven home my spouse has treated me like a loser.  That very day they decided that we need to start donating plasma to make ends meet.  My spouse then left w/o me and stated that somebody had to stay home with the kids.  When they returned they were very cold to me and treated me like *because I didn’t go donate blood I’m not helping out with our money problems.* Even though I’ve been the catalyst behind all the financial rearranging I pointed out above.  This continued to escalate with my spouse telling me that I needed to get a second job during the day while the kids are in school to supplement my other job. **EDIT: The kids are in year round and somebody school and somebody has to be home when they're not in school** My spouse makes more money than I, but it’s never been an issue, and now suddenly they are telling me I don’t make enough to contribute to the family.  Even though I was hurt by this, I took it and said nothing, hoping that their anger would blow over and we could have a civil discussion about it.

Things escalated to my spouse asking why I don’t make as much money as my friends (people who have been in their respective fields for 10-15 years).  OUCH!  But I took that too.  Things have to get better.

My spouse began to be very cold to me, not speaking to me, making rude comments and just generally being hard to live with.  I keep taking it, hoping it will cease but I’ve started avoiding my spouse because I don’t want to have to deal with the maltreatment.

This past Saturday comes and my spouse tells me we’re going to their family’s house for dinner.  At this time I’m not fond of being anywhere with my spouse and don’t feel like taking the car trip and risking a fight in front of the kids.  I tell them that I don’t really feel like going but never tell them that I won't go.

This prompts my spouse to ask our 3 children if they want me to go with them to Grandma’s house.  They respond “no”.  My spouse’s attempt at a guilt trip backfires and they quickly try to use the “no” answer in their favor saying that I should feel bad that they don’t want me there.  What I jerk thing to do.  So I tell them that I really don’t want to go, especially if I’m not wanted.  Later that night when my spouse returns, not a word was spoken.

***THE good/BAD PART***

Sunday morning, we have a get together planned with some friends.  I want my spouse to be tolerable so I try to be as sweet as possible all morning, but they aren’t haven’t anything of it.

You know that voice you make when you’re describing somebody who’s been rude to you?  My spouse spoke to me like this all morning. I wake up and jump in the shower.  My spouse comes storming in and states that they wanted to take a shower.  Any other day, they would just hop in with me and be done with it.  I say, “I’ll be done in a minute” and quickly finish up.  I get out and begin dressing and remember that my spouse offered to prepare some food for the get together.  I ask “have you started on the chicken rolls?”  They respond with “It wasn’t a priority”.  Ok they’re going to be in a bad mood.  I offer to start making them and ask what I need to start mixing.  I’m told that the recipe is in the recipe box, in a rude tone.  Of course it is, but I’m just looking for some interaction.

I go down and begin to prepare the stuffing for the croissant rolls and by now we’re over a half an hour late and a text from my friends suggest we bring everything over and bake them there.  Excellent Idea, then my spouse won’t feel so flustered and rushed to finish.  As they come down stairs I say, “I noticed the recipe wants a cup and a half of chicken and one of these cans fits just a little more than one cup and since we’re doubling it I put 3 cans in”  They reply that I ruined the stuffing and I did it wrong.  I say, “well, the rolls will have more stuffing now” with a smile.

Up to this point, I’ve taken everything my spouse has dealt me over the past few weeks, and let the water just roll off my back.  As I start packing everything up to head over to our friend’s house they ask, “We’re not making them here?”  I say, “no.”
“Well maybe I just won’t go then.”

I snap!  I can’t describe really how I felt at that moment; it was almost like an out of body experience, everything was in slow motion and I can still see every detail so vividly, I don’t think I’ve ever felt that angry before in my life.  I throw the Tupperware full of the chicken stuffing into the kitchen where my spouse is, not at them but into the kitchen, screaming at the top of my lungs “FUCK YOU!” over and over.  The look of shock and stunned disbelief on my spouses face as stuffing is splattered across the cabinets and floor seems to only add fuel to the fire.  I take a can of croissant rolls and hurl it into the kitchen.  As it breaks the individual rolls separate in midair.  The second tube is launched and then the third, “FUCK YOU!” spilling out like water over a broken dam.  I grab the row of xbox games from on top of the entertainment center on my way out and spill them to the floor, “FUCK YOU!” and stomp out the door.

I arrive at our friends’ house and explain that my spouse won’t be joining us and that I don’t have any food.  They’re supportive and other people have brought other things to snack on, so the rolls were hardly missed.  Mostly because everyone besides me has no idea how delicious they are.  I go over what happened and most of them give a nervous laugh and say they’ve been that angry at one time or another.  Another one decides to try to do damage control and go over to my house to talk to my spouse.  When I return home I take a nap on the couch and don’t speak to my spouse the rest of the night.

***HERE’S WHERE IT GETS DIRTY***

The next day at work, my spouse opens a chat with me in gmail.  They go on to say that nobody deserves what I did to them last night and that I’m a crazy bully for what I did.

I’m beside myself with anger.  I reply that if they don’t think they deserved what happened then they’re delusional.

My spouse goes on to explain that I have been the one being cold, rude and avoiding all contact with them.

I can’t believe what I’m reading.  I explain EVERYTHING they’d done over the past weeks that I had let slide and what happened on Sunday morning was when it reached its tipping point.

They explain that they didn’t’ mean any harm by what was said and that they didn’t deserve to have food thrown at them while yelling “FUCK YOU!”

I tell my spouse that they are disgusting, and that I can’t believe they think they’re an innocent party to what went down.  And after more debate I tell my spouse to die in a fire and lots and lots of other terrible things.

I can’t look this person in the eye anymore.  They truly believe I had some kind of psychotic episode when I freaked out at them on Sunday, that they had no part in the building up of what it became.  Do I just give up 13 years and ruin the lives of 3 beautiful children?  I’m not going to lie, I’m a proud person and I have a hard time just letting something like that go.  I can forgive somebody who’s trespassed against me but I’m having the hardest time letting somebody who takes no responsibility for what happened, off.

**TL;DR:  Spouse called me crazy for blowing up at them for after weeks of mistreament and acts like they're innocent**

These are numbered but are in no particular order. 

1) Downtime

If you have an iPhone, use the 'Downtime' feature during mornings. It's under 'Screen Time'. Essentially, every single app &amp; website is locked for you during the times that you set. You can set certain apps and websites that are needed, such as email and school portals etc as 'Always Allowed'. When I wake up, I have a bad habit of staying in bed for a while browsing my phone. Setting my downtime from the morning to afternoon allows me to not get caught up on social media, forcing me to get out of bed and get my shit done. 

2) App Restrictions

You don't actually have to follow the restrictions. Under 'Screen Time', see which apps you use the most. Mainly social media apps. Set 1 hour restrictions on these apps daily. You don't actually need to follow these restrictions. Once the app is restricted, you can choose to 'ignore restriction for 15 minutes'. Do this throughout the day as many times as you need. Again, I have a horrible habit of going through social media and not realizing how much time I spend doing it. Throughout the day, basically every time you want to use the app it'll remind you that you've passed the limit, and if you click 'ignore for 15 minutes' then once 15 minutes shoots by, you'll realize it instead of spending an hour on your phone thinking only 5 minutes have passed. I estimate that 90% of you reading this are on Reddit avoiding your other responsibilities. Restrictions will help with this. 

3) Timers

When I'm studying, I usually take constant breaks. Studying has the opposite effect on me as social media; 10 minutes of studying feels like an hour of studying. Setting timers allows you to see how much time you're spending while you're studying. My method is to set a timer. 25 minutes of studying, then a 5-10 minute break depending on how burnt out I am. Time your breaks too. Bathroom breaks count as your breaks, you can't take your 10 minute break then go use the bathroom

4) Libraries/Study Rooms

If you don't like studying in public, you should suck it up and do it anyway. When you're home, you're surrounded by comfort and distractions. If you take the time to leave your house and go to the library, you're committing to study. If you stay home, you can stop anytime you want. 

5) Rewards

I love steak. I eat about 1lb of steak on a daily basis. Every time I go steak shopping, I'll by packs of cheap prime New York Strips, but I'll also get some expensive wagyu steak. I leave it in my freezer, and I'm not allowed to eat it unless I get an A on a test or hard assignment. Overall, I use wagyu steaks as rewards for things, not only for tests/assignments. It's good to reward yourself. 

6) Posture

When I first started developing my study habits, my posture was terrible. I'd lean forward and my head would be facing down for hours. Once I left the library, my body would be stuck leaning forward and the muscles in my frontal upper body were very tight. It was terrible. I practiced sitting up straight, and rather than facing my head down, I'd keep my head straight and face my eyes down. It was hard the first few times, but now I can comfortably stay at the library for 8 hours and not feel like a train wreck afterwards. I'd say posture is one of the most important things on this list. 

7) Exercise

It's a fact that we study better after we've exercised. Exercise also helps with mental health. You don't need to go lift heavy weights for 3 hours. A nice walk, a small run, anything physical before you start studying will help. 

8) NUTRITION AND HYDRATION

If you don't focus on nutrition and hydration, you need to reevaluate the way you see yourself. You are an animal and a machine. Water is the root of all life. Water is our fuel. I see water the same way a car sees gasoline. I NEED IT. I drink 1.5 gallons per day and I always feel great. My ex literally drank 1 tiny cup of water per day and ate 2 tiny meals per day and she never had energy to do anything. WE ARE BEASTS. WE NEED FUEL. WE NEED WATER. WE NEED FOOD. If you take no effort in getting in your protein, calories, and hydration on a daily basis, then don't complain that you don't have energy. Furthermore, STUDYING TAKES ENERGY. I'm a gym rat. I track my calories and my macros, time my meals throughout the day etc. I see my study sessions as workout sessions. Every hour you study is 1 set of brain curls. If you're not properly feeding yourself, you aren't going to study well, same way with working out. On days where I know I'll be at the library for a while, I will fill a medium sized water bottle full of fat free milk (Fat free has no cholesterol) and take it with me, along with protein bars, protein shakes, and gallon water bottles. The natural sugars in milk are fine for you even if you're cutting. Brain power uses up carbs, so a nice cup of milk or orange juice while studying can help replenish you. 

9) Sleep

This one is obvious, and I'm sure everyone has read tips saying get more sleep. Time is precious. When you are dead tired while you're studying, your brain is less engaged, it takes you much more time to process information, and you retain much less information. If it's the day before the exam, alright understandable to stay up late cramming. But on the days leading up to the exam, make sure you're getting your sleep or else you aren't retaining any of that information. 

Get some melatonin, it's an OTC drug that is naturally found in our bodies and is responsible for sleep. As a matter of fact, melatonin production increases when it's dark. So if you're staying in a lit up room with screens on full brightness, you aren't going to get sleep. Make sure your room is as dark as possible and turn down phone brightness. 

10) Fashion over comfort (situational)

This one might be weird to some. It's situational depending on your personality. Personally, I feel happy and confident when I'm well dressed.  Even when I go to the grocery store, I like dressing up. My mood can be swayed by how I'm dressed. If I dress like a celebrity and go to the library, I'm more likely to be happy and stay longer because I enjoy being dressed up. If I dress up in my hobo clothes to be comfortable since I know I'm staying a while, maybe I'll be physically comfort, but my mood will be lazy and tired since my comfort clothes are my lazy and tired clothes. Again, this is situational. If you are happiest in a hoodie and sweats, then by all means go with that. 

11) Classical Music

I normally hate classical music, but you aren't going to retain information well if you listen to songs that you know the beats/lyrics to. When songs I know/like are playing, my brain is subconsciously following along with the beat since I know the beat. You want your entire focus to be on studying. On Spotify, some things I search up while studying include ""calm piano"" ""calming classical"" ""lofi study"". Find whatever works for you. The beats can't be catchy. It has to be background music. Classical music is also known to help with focus. Tie this idea back to number 3: Timing. Listen to classical music the 25 minutes that you're studying, then play your favorite songs during your break.

12) HEADPHONE VOLUME

I'm not sure what is shown for other headphones, but on iPhone with AirPods, you can control the dB of your audio. Basically, even if your volume is turned down, there are certain sounds within music that can exceed safe dB levels. When studying, your goal is to have background music but be focused on studying. You don't want to damage your hearing for background music. Most of our headphones are automatically set to the highest decibel level, which Is 100 decibels and is as loud as an ambulance siren in your ear. The lowest decibel option is 75, which is as loud as a vacuum cleaner. If you're like me and you're used to absolutely destroying your ears, it'll take you a bit to get used to these lower levels. But like I said, since you're listening to background classical music, it doesn't really matter. Feel free to turn the dB back up during your breaks when listening to songs you like. Sounds - Headphone Safety is where you can find this feature. If you set the slider all the way to the bottom, you can max out your headphone volume safely. 

13) STRETCH

Even with good posture, when typing/taking notes, your body will have a natural tendency to lean forward, resulting in tightening of your chest and frontal shoulder muscles. During your breaks, go to the bathroom and get in a nice stretch. Get some paper, lay it on your flat out hand, and put your hand against a wall with a straight arm and tilt your body/chest away to get a nice stretch in your chest. Stretching is very important and it replenishes you. 

14) ROUTINE

Any other fellow gym rats know that gym isn't an ""option"" in your day. My days are planned around my workouts and any other duties I have. I'm never like ""eh I won't do it today"" because it's part of my routine. You need to make studying this way as well. It's good to plan out what times you will study. My mornings and early afternoons are for school and work. My mid afternoons are for gym. Once it's around 4-6PM, I'm already done with my workout, almost done with my daily caloric intake, already showered, and my only other obligations are to go study. Then I'll go to the library, bring drinks and snacks, and stay there until 11 - 12.

notdad,1291401568,/r/AskReddit/comments/efqj5/cant_have_kids_and_cant_figure_out_how_to_be_ok/,"I’m not really sure if this is the place to post this…but here goes. I don’t know what I’m looking for really out of doing this either. Advice in coping? Similar stories? I dunno. Maybe I just need to actually let it all out. This ended up pretty long, and I could have definitely been  a lot longer. I’m sure there won’t be many readers, and there will be a lot of trolls. But hopefully there will be someone out there that actually has been through something similar and can give a little incite…

**tl;dr: Wife and I can’t have kids after years of trying and doing fertility treatments. We are very angry and bitter towards friends/family/strangers that have families, but don’t know how to get over it.**

**EDIT: I know this is long, so no one read below. SO, Yes...we would love to adopt. But we have a LONG time before that can happen. We have a very large bill from in vitro to pay off first, then the cost of adoption which is even more expensive...***

So first, the background: My wife and I married at 20, and have been happily married 9 years. There was no doubt that we both wanted to have children. Her family is quite small with only one sibling and both parents being only children. I have four siblings, lots of kids on both parent’s side, tons of cousins, and 13 nieces and nephews. My father is a retired high school teacher/coach of 40+ years, two of my siblings are also teachers, and my mom and another sibling both own their own day care facilities. I started college to become a teacher as well, but ended up moving into another field…although I do still coach high school sports. Point being in all this is that even though our families are very different in size, we share the same strength and love because of our upbringing. Even our two families are pretty tight since we grew up in the same very small town.   

For the first few years we were together, we never took any precautions to avoid becoming pregnant. We weren’t technically trying, but it would be ok if it happened. However about five years ago, we started actively trying to start a family. After a year or two of no luck, we decided to see if something was wrong. That started countless tests on both of us to see if there was a reason. We started with our family doctor, then her GYN, and then gradually were referred up to one of the top fertility clinics in the country. Still…no diagnosis. Nothing could be found in either of us that would be causing infertility. The doctors explained that when it comes to infertility there are pretty much four levels: 1.) There is an issue with the women. 2.) There is an issue with the man. 3.) There is a small issue with the women, small issue with the man…put them together…big issue. **4.) Undetermined/Unknown.** 

As you can guess, we fall under number four. They explained that there really was definite reason why we were having so much trouble. There were very minor things that showed up in tests, but those were very common in men/women and didn’t point to anything severe enough. Basically we were just unlucky. Month after month we kept trying. She took her temperature every day to help predict ovulation. We ate right, took vitamins, did everything we could to optimize our chances. But month after month, we were disappointed. Visits from Aunt Flo weren’t just that normal few days women have each month. She was devastated…each and every time. Yes, of course I was upset too. But she felt if differently than I did…and I bottled it up to be strong for her.

We opted to begin fertility treatments, which started with IUI (intra-uterine insemination). This process includes ovulation stimulation pills for my wife, and then manually putting my stuff in her when it’s time. (Ya know… the turkey baster method.) After four unsuccessful rounds of that, we decided to move on to IVF (in vitro fertilization) this past summer. For those who don’t know; IVF is very different than the above method. It is very expensive ($20,000+) and is not covered by most insurance policies. (Mine included.) The process requires several weeks of me giving her nightly hormone and fertility shots which were on a pretty strict time schedule. She had to endure shots in the stomach, thighs, and hips…and at some points as many as four a day. Then they harvest as many eggs as they possibly can, and put them together outside the body with my stuff to let them fertilize. They wait a few days, and then put the embryos back in her body. The shot, pills, blood tests, ultrasounds, and emotional ups and down from the shots are just a few of the stresses of this process. We prepared ourselves the best we could. For the most part, we cleared our social calendar from July – October. Knowing this may someday come up we had been saving money for years, but that was all pretty much used up with the IUI procedures. We had to take out a significant loan to cover the costs, but it was all going to be worth it. We felt good going into “game day”.  They implanted three healthy embryos, so now we just had to wait two weeks to see if they attached. Soon the past few years of disappointment were going to be over. This was going to work. 

But it didn’t.   

Devastated is not the word. I’ve never felt anything like this in my life. After we got the phone call, I lost it. I don’t even remember how the mailbox got in the neighbors driveway. I don’t remember sitting in the front yard bawling for hours. It was surreal. While she had been letting a little out every single month for the past several years…I hadn’t. I needed to be strong for her, and in my head in vitro was going to be the fix someday if we needed it. I really never considered that it may not work. Sure, I saw the stats so logically I knew the chances. But I never emotionally considered it. I NEVER thought for a second that I may not have children. How was this even possible? Neither of us went a day without crying the first month.   

Now, a few months later…the daily kick in the guts isn’t near as bad. But we still are not doing well. I know there are steps in the grief process which fall in line with all I’m about to say. But my fear is that we won’t be able to get back on top of this thing. I don’t know what to do. We have been through a lot of hard times…as a couple and individually. Hell, she sat here by herself and waited for me while I was in Iraq for over a year. We are strong, happy, social, non-judgmental, hard working, optimistic people. Well…we were.  

My wife and I are good people, and we have worked hard to make our lives what they are. We have made conscious decisions with goals of a secure future. Some of those decisions have been very difficult because of moving away from family, or taking a job that isn’t quite what we wanted. We’ve sacrificed a lot to get here, but it’s been worth it. We are now both in great careers and own a house in a pretty good neighborhood. We are definitely not rich, no where close. But, we are comfortable. So, here is where it gets tough. 

I don’t believe in fate or that everything happens for a reason. So I’m contradicting that by my next question. How the hell do we get the “when’s it our turn for something good to happen?” feeling out of our heads? I can’t help buy wonder why even work hard to succeed, if you can just be a dirtbag and get everything handed to you. Why try to become a better person, if you can sit on your ass and be lazy…and get what you want. There are just SO many examples of why we feel this way walking around us in life every day. It’s so hard to accept that all we’ve done to create a secure future was for nothing, because people with no jobs and no intent of ever getting one…have litters of children. They are fine sitting there collecting welfare and unemployment. The more kids…the more free money. These same parents are the ones I see hitting and swearing at their kids in stores. The same parents on news reports daily of child abuse and abandonment. It just feels so unfair that we can’t have kids…and these people evidently can get knocked up by looking at each other. I get furious when I see this kind of stuff…so we don’t go out in public much anymore. 

So, Reddit…how do we get past this anger, bitterness, and jealousy? It’s not just that we are just being annoyed by white trash at Wal-Mart. It’s difficult for us to hear about anyone, including family or friends that are expecting. It’s impossible to look them in the eye and be happy for them. We are at the age that a lot of friends are starting families. We are really the only ones left that don’t have at least one kid. It’s around us all the time and we can’t deal with it. This has caused us to shut everyone out the past few months, and we don’t know how to get out of it. Anyone that’s thinking, “Well, think about all the stuff you’ll be able to do in life without kids, that they won’t be able to.” That’s not what we want…so it’s a completely irrelevant point. Someday we hope to adopt. There are a lot of kids in the world that come from the households I just described. They need a good family to be with, and we would love to be that family. But first we have a HUGE bill for in vitro that will need paid off before we can start saving again to adopt. It could be ten years before we are at that point, plus add a couple more years for the process itself. Who knows if it will even happen?  I know that “time mends all wounds”, and to a degree I believe that. But I just don’t have a clue how we will be ever come to peace with never having children, while not feeling bitter towards everyone else who can.

[deleted],1297967155,/r/AskReddit/comments/fnciz/need_advice_on_dealing_with_my_severely_depressed/,"Hi Reddit.  This is the first time I've reached out for your advice.  I'm having a hard time so please keep snarky comments to yourselves.  I really need some advice.  I’m sorry if this is very long and I appreciate your reading it.

BACKSTORY:   I have a younger sister (18) who is diagnosed as bipolar and spend most of her life on many types of medication.  I have always suspected that my mother was also bipolar as she has a lot of the same symptoms that my sister has.  My mother and my sister have a very bad relationship - it frequently turns into physical fighting, and they have a huge fight about 365 days a year.  My sister and I have always had a great relationship.  I think my sister is beautiful and brilliant, and my mother thinks my sister is a total fuck up failure and makes this clear at every possible point.  I am trying very, very hard to instill some confidence in my sister.  But anytime I try to help my sister or support her decisions, my mother thinks we’re “ganging up on her” and that my sister has “manipulated me into blindly believing” that my mother is a horrible person.  (This is starting to become a self-fulfilling prophesy.)  Lately I’ve been helping me sister through a hard time.  My father left his job so the three of them have been without insurance, so my sister doesn’t have the option of being on her medication anymore or talking to a therapist.  She’s in another state trying to get a job.  My mother thinks health insurance is not important – she’s asked me to get rid of mine because it’s so expensive and I said no.  This has caused a lot of tension between all of us.  My mother keeps telling my sister to go back on meds because she’s acting crazy, and I keep attempting to explain to my mother that she needs to get new health insurance.  Unfortunately I can’t put my sister on my plan.  I told my sister to get a gig at a starbucks or other company that she can get her own health insurance through.

I have a really strained relationship with my mom.  She desperately needs me to be “the good kid.”  I’m her proof to other people that she’s not a horrible mom.  She thinks that my sister’s illness is her fault, and that it could be cured if only my sister would co-operate.  (My dad and I have mixed feelings on this.  I think she’s deluded, my dad thinks that she’s stronger for her optimism and faith.  Maybe he's right.)  I’m somehow her proof that she’s not a total fuck up of a mom.  But she trained me to be a doll.  If I disagreed with her, I would be punished very harshly.  Even if it was, “no mom that wasn’t yesterday, it was the day before.”  THAT would turn into “don’t argue with me!  I’m the parent – not you!  You need to give in and obey me!”  In public, it was always, “this daughter and I are best friends!  We have a perfect relationship!”  which I never thought was true, but I was happy to go along with if it made her happy.  

My mother has frequently threatened to kill herself, and was morbidly depressed for most of my childhood.  There was one great summer when she was on antidepressants, but she refuses to take them now.  I remember that as being the happiest time I had when I was a kid.   I've spent almost every conversation I've had with her, ever, trying to make her happy.  If we go shopping and she picks out a shirt for me that I don't like, she says ""You only don't want this because I picked it out!  You hate me!"" and storms off and sometimes cries.  I have to spend the rest of the day telling her I don't hate her.  We moved when I was in 8th grade, and I've spent countless hours trying to explain to her that I don't hate her for moving us.  She things I'm furious with her about this.  I'm really not - I liked the place we moved to.  When I was about 9, she told me all about this other man that she was in love with that was not my dad.  I once said “yeah” instead of “yes ma’am” (it was 9am on a frigging Sunday morning) and it turned into her pushing me into a wall for my “blatant disrespect” and her calling the police on me when I slapped her back.  That same year I disagreed with her about something really basic, like something on the news and she screamed “you argue with everything!  That’s why all your boyfriends leave you!”  That one was just weird.  She talked non-stop about being afraid my friends hear all about our personal life, and begged me not to go telling everyone what was going on, so I didn’t.  There are a lot of other examples – I’m not really sure what the best ones are to illustrate the situation.  I’m trying to be objective and not slant the truth.  I’ve always had a lot of respect for my sister actually for being a lot more outspoken and not acting like a doormat like I did.

I’ve recently come to realize just how weird all that was.  It all just seemed normal to me as a kid, cause that’s all I knew.  But, I’ve been with a boyfriend now for about a year and a half.  He’s met the family a few times.  Sometimes I’ll be telling him a story, and I’ll get about half way through and he’s looking at me really concerned.  I’ve started to realize that this stuff sounds pretty bad when you tell other people.  It took him a while to finally say this, but he used the word “abuse” about a month ago and that really made my head spin.  I know my mother wants nothing but good things for me, and I don’t believe SHE is abusive.  I’d never considered it before.  She showers me with money and gifts and has been supportive of my going to a really expensive school and starting my own company.  I think her illness has been abusive though.  I’m starting to get mad that she made us deal with this.  It sounds like she needs help with what she is going through, and she was looking for that help in me when I was way too young to deal with it.

SO – here’s what is going on now, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.  My father recently started a new job in another state and we are all four living in different states.  It’s hard on everyone.  

My sister and my mom had a fight earlier this week – my mother threatened to cut her money off and insisted she go back on medication.  I called my mom to mediate and hear her side of the story, and to attempt to explain again that my sister can’t go back on meds if we don’t have health insurance.

But when my mother picked up the phone she was hyperventilating on the other end of the phone.  She wasn’t talking to me, she was just repeating, “I can’t wake up tomorrow.  I can’t wake up tomorrow.  I don’t want to wake up tomorrow.”  I asked her what was going on and she started talking about feeling overwhelming guilt for giving my sister meds, for her mother’s death and her father’s death (both died badly – one of parkinsons and my grandmother was a quadriplegic for many years before she passed.)  I immediately realized that this was not a normal “bad day” for mom.  My father was in another state and I’m 1000 miles away, so I told my best friend from highschool to go over there immediately, which she did.  (Maybe I should have called 911 – it didn’t occur to me until later.)  She stayed with my mom until she was asleep and called me right after.  My best friend also has bipolar disorder so she’s very close to my sister, and understands the situation like no one else could.  We talked and I told her that I think my mom needs help, and she agreed.  My boyfriend also agreed.  We were all seriously concerned that she is close to hurting herself.  

So, I wrote my mom a really heartfelt letter.  I copied my dad and sister.  I told her that I thinks she needs help, and that I’ve thought this for a while.  I made it clear that I can no longer be the one to deal with this, and that if she is really that bad off then she needs to be proactive about her health and seek help from a professional.  I told her to try therapy, to be open to medication, and to “quit her job and move to Barcelona if she has to” but that I can’t deal with it anymore.  I told her that if she really is suicidal that she MUST seek help immediately, and if she’s not actually suicidal to not do this to me.  I said that if we can’t afford health insurance, that we need to restructure our habits so that we can afford it, because it’s not optional.  I finally told her that I’m angry with her for making me deal with this.  (I’ll post the email if you want – it’s long though.)

She LOST IT with me.  To the health insurance question, she said (in all caps) “WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT?!?”  (my Dad just got a great job – there’s plenty of money for health insurance.) and to the rest she writes that I’m “blindly believing” my sister’s “lies,” and that I need to “APOLOGIZE” for these “insults.”  She says the only thing her brain chemistry needs is more sleep – she’s not getting enough sleep.

**TL;DR: SKIP TO HERE:**
Reddit – what do I do?  I believe my mother has been depressed for decades, possibly bi-polar and undiagnosed, and I think she is in danger of hurting herself.  I told her how concerned I was and she’s furious.  How would you handle a relative in this situation?  I realize that I can’t MAKE her do anything and I can’t bring her happiness, but what would you do to get her help?

Thank you for the free therapy and advice.  I’m sorry if this is really long.  And if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t: this is really hard for me to do.

    Painting the picture..

Single male, 30 years old. Living in central Arkansas. No kids. **No debt**. I went to college when I was 18 years old after being in the top echelon &amp; AP classes in all of my junior through high school years and went to college for 2 years, but only got credit for 1 year of classes cause I withdrew or failed the others. I was always the shy kid growing up and had only a couple of friends. Never went to a party, never dated, nothing. College gets here and I have my first drink. I move in with now 4 friends in a 2 bedroom apartment on campus. I GM a chain of video game stores and rack up a good 50 hours a week, while taking 12 hours of classes. Long story short, something had to break and I never had a direction in school. I was going to do Film, but the school didn't offer that program yet. Admittedly, I just went to college cause I was a dumb 18 year old and we are all sent to college with the idea of ""Figure It Out"". Thankfully, instead of spending more thousands of dollars on a degree that I'm not quite sure would have financially got me anywhere, I dropped out. But, that was after passing all of my classes the last semester to get myself out of academic probation. So, left in good standing.

Spent the next few years going from job to job after the owner of the video game franchise fucked up his personal finances with his 8 businesses and had to declare bankruptcy. I paid off the $15,000 I owed the university for my fucking shit up. Found a fantastic bartending position at 24 years old. Started making around $40k a year. Which is a ton for a single, bachelor guy without any responsibilities and in a very low cost of living state. So, kind of partied for the rest of my 20's and went on vacations. Saw a ton of shows, went to Bonnaroo 11 times (couple of times as a teenager), traveled, did cool shit. Had a good time.

    Now..

I'm 30. Don't want to bartend the rest of my life FOR SURE. Hate working until 3AM. I hate most of the 21 year olds that come in the bar. There's no career path with this job, I've been at the glass ceiling for 5 years now and I DEFINITELY don't want to manage. And one day I want to start a family. Also, I'm overrrr the party life. I hardly touch drinking. I went almost a year without drinking recently (damn 30th birthdays). I'm just ready to be..... a 30 year old, I suppose.

So, I enrolled back at my old university. Pretty big school. They accepted me back immediately. I was looking at Computer Science initially after a frustrating 6 month span of redditing and talking to people and pulling all of my hair out. I was enjoying some courses on Team Treehouse. But, I ended up talking to some very like minded friends who urged me to do MIS (Management Information Systems) instead. Same job path, same career trajectory, same pay (perhaps a little lower ceiling on pay, but I don't need to make $200k a year), but wayyy more people skills involved (which I excel at) and business classes instead of advanced math classes in the course. Still learn programming. My buddy's company literally just hired 2 guys for the same job. One was CS. One was MIS. Same job. Same pay.
-
MIS &amp; CS opportunities are growing substantially in Arkansas. If you're not from Arkansas, you probably think this place is redneck and backwoods. But, if you grew up here, you know it's an amazing place with an awesomeeee low cost of living. I love the place. Also, looks like it is very likely an Amazon warehouse will be moving in just 25 minutes away from me in the next few years. Which could line RIGHT up with me finishing up my degree. Could be perfect. 
-
Now, I'm not going to lie. A big reason why I chose MIS, outside of the confidence of succeeding in the field, is the pay. You don't walk off that stage making less than $60k a year. That's almost twice what I'm doing now and that's just starting pay. 
-
I'm going to the University of Central Arkansas. Which has an excellent program for MIS. 
-
    Now, the financial stuff..
My first semester back, I'm taking just 3 classes to get back in the groove. Microeconomics to get it out of the way cause it's required for MIS, Biology for a gen ed, and Nutrition for another gen ed that's easy to pad the GPA stats. I signed up for the best professors &amp; classes literally 2 minutes after the 5 AM window opened for picking classes. I'm not fucking this shit up like my dumb ass 18 year old self.
-
I'm still at my bartending job. Despite wanting to move on with my life, I thankfully work with some of my best friends and I make good money. Also, most importantly, because of my seniority, they can work with my class schedule. So, this is what I have devised:
-
    Class Day Schedule:
    - 9:30AM-10:40AM
    - 12:15PM-1:30PM
    - 2:40PM-3:55PM

    MON: Off
    TUE: Class Day Schedule
    WED: 3PM-5PM Lab
    THU: Class Day Schedule &amp; Work @ 9PM-3AM
    FRI: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SAT: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SUN: Work 8PM-3AM

- I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting off at 3 AM the night of having to get to class at 9:45AM.
- Thursdays are gonna suck, it's possible I can occasionally work those. But, Scott Steiner math suggests I Don't Be A Pussy and just red bull it up and work that Thursday anyways.
-
    Work Info:
    With those 4 days of working, I should be able to pull $600-$700 a week.
    Knock off one night and move it to 3 days of working, $500-$600 a week.

    Utilities
My rent is around **$550** a month after utilities splitting a 1,500 square foot home with 2 roommates. Being older and having experience with having up to 7 roommates at the same time, I just can't do more than 2. Preferably, I'd be by myself, but the world is not perfect. Oh, and I'm a 5 minute drive away from campus.

* ***Food cost is around $400ish*** as I also do some bodybuilding and the occasional dates with the lady.

* The rest of my bills between health insurance, phone bill, gym, netflix, Adobe Suite (sidework), etc is about **$430 a month**. Sooooo..

* Bills + Rent/Utilities + Food = **roughly $1,400 a month**

* Working 4 days with stacking one work night a week on class schedule, I should be able to roughly expect **$2,400 a month.**

**Leaves $1,000 aside** for anything in the world that could happen. Life shit. I also have a girlfriend. She is very supportive and awesome and is more frugally minded anyways. So, we can have just as good of a time hanging out at home vs. going out often.

    But Student Loans Now...my main inquiry..
I'm expecting to be able to get grants and possibly scholarships next semester in the fall after I get my GPA up and I have this time of the year to apply.

* I can get 2 loans with my university. Subsidized which will cover my tuition this semester ($3,100). Along with an unsubsidized loan for $5,300. I obviously need the subsidized loan so I can have my tuition covered. The unsub I'm wrestling around with.
* In all honesty, I'm not too concerned about getting into debt with student loans, because I will be increasing my earnings from **$40k a year** full time before college *(which, the timeline left on that job is probably only 2 years max and I do not want to continue that line of work)* to starting at **$60k a year**. Possibly up to **$80k a year** and then with some years of working, I could get up to over **$100k** easily.

So, $40k-$50k in student loan debt seems more of a Spend Money to Make Money situation to me.

* If I took both the sub &amp; unsub loans. That would also allow me to not worry about work. Be able to give shifts up when I need to for extra studying/project time. As, it has been 10 years since I've been in school. Now, I'm serious about it and want to be at the top of my class in every class. This is my future in my hands.

* Taking the $5,300 unsub loan would give an extra $1,000+ a month during school that could be used to cover all of my living expenses.

Then, the money I make at work? I save.

* Obviously, I'm taking on debt. So, I'm not exactly saving. But, I save that money until I graduate, then I can put an immediate HUGE dent into my student loans. And, I also have the money for anything that comes up, such as moving into a new place. Car breaking down. Etc, etc. Which brings me toooooo...

*      Should I buy a house?**

I currently live in a rent house. It's $1,150 a month before utilities that I split with 2 other roommates. I've already lived in the same city for 10 years. And with school, I'm locked in for another 3 years. 

* My credit score is 717.

Of course, that's before the loans. That's right now. After rent and utlities (I pay more for the bigger room with its own bathroom), I'm averaging $550 a month. Sometimes a little lower, sometimes a little higher. I could see me and my girlfriend eventually wanting to move in together. 

* My lease is up in May and then it moves to month to month. 

My current situation is fine. But, staying here for school the next 3 years, rent minus utilities....just rent, is gonna cost me **$15,000+.**

* Perhaps I should buy a house instead? I could get something decent for around $110k-$140k. That's 1,200-1,500 square foot, 3 beds &amp; 2 bathrooms usually. I could still have a roommate/my girlfriend pay me rent so I'm not eating the whole thing.

If I need to move after graduating, I could just make it a rent house.

[deleted],1426445248,/r/college/comments/2z5btl/changing_my_major_and_chasing_my_dreams/,"Greetings and salutations, my friends.

I am turning to you in a dire need of assistance. Namely, I have gotten stuck in quite the rut. As a university student, I've naturally been having many troubles regarding my studies, but as for the grand problem that has been haunting me for a good while now I'm pointing out an insidious desire to abandon my current studies, therefore to procure a change of my major.

I've been studying a joint mathematics and computer science program for three years now. In all this time, I've achieved little progress in regards to the succesful completion of my exams, and have had an inconsequential degree of self-imposed research of the topics correlating to my field of study. I would have had many thoughts in the past of abandonment than I dare count, but my stubborness would always prevail, leading me to a change of premises on the matter. Nowadays, I'm unfortunately finding an unsfurable dullness to my lectures, and just the act of being present at the aforementioned lectures brings me great pains, and leads me to feel a fool.
Thus have I – despite all my best efforts and intentions – quite recently indeed passed the relieving decision to relinquish my ambitions of obtaining a mathematics degree. Before I outline what would it be the major that I'd then wish to declare, I will want to display what have been my reasons of entering this faculty, and of what nature have been my successes, such as they were:

From a young age, I have had many an interraction with computers, making me glad of the comforts of the modern age I lived in, as many would I dare say agree with me. I loved the joy of discovery, of experimentation, and of the solving of logic puzzles. I have then naturally been led me to a high interest in mathematics throughout grade school and middle school. However, straight A's don't necessarily mean a higher-than-normal aptitude for a subject, so alas I'd have quite a weak success in maths competitions, and more often than not I would need an assistance from private tutors as I found my understanding at the school lectures to be unsufficient for a further proliferation of my mathematical understanding. Entering university, I was intensily struck with the stark difference between college and high school maths, but I still proceeded forward. Unfortunately, I am a much sicklish individual, and my chronic illness would beset me in a debilitating state, leave me inpacatitated for months at a time, nullifying any progress I might have achieved in my maths studies, leading me to incur a forgetfulness of much of what I had knew afore, and progressing me further behind my peers in my lectures. My state had become better, but I can't ignore the fact how I have been led me to a twice-repeat of my first year. Luckily, my university has been more than understanding of my condition, and I did not have a pay for the repeat. Regardless, it doesn't negate the fact that it has led me further away from mathematics, no matter how many times during summer would I rediscover the joy of discovery in mathematics, and successfully instrument on my own a proof of a formula or a theorem. I have always comforted myself with the fact how mathematics and computer science are one of the fields most in demand, and how I would always have a job with this degree. But nowadays it is as if I've lost the mathematical mind, and problems that I could solve with ease before have become intensily difficult and dull, even the programming ones.

On the other hand, I've always had an immense love for literature and deep thought. I would always relish in self-reflection, and ask myself many hard questions. As soon as I learnt to read, I remember picking up Tolkien's Hobbit, and completing it several times in a row. That's when I knew I wanted to make it my business to read as much as I can, and create enticing stories and conclusions for my own behalf. I would enter writing contests and attend history competitions, at which I had much more success in comparison. I would enroll in drama sections, and I would be handed out main roles in plays. I loved typing; I would take a book, and copywrite a vast majority of it in my computer. Later on, I would become active on gaming forums and I would write content and articles, compose interview questions, archive data and links, and actively moderate my sections. Of course, all of this was pro bono, but I appreciated the chance the community administrators gave me, and it just helped me to further improve my writing skills. I wasn't always the most consistent, and I would have many breaks in such efforts, the longest lasting an entire year even. But I returned to writing articles relating to games on a more freelance basis, before I got accepted at a different community, and once even getting a paid job offer, which I unfortunately had to turn down due to my health becoming worse yet again. Now I won't argue that my writing efforts  were of any high quality, but at least as I matured, I could notice a marked improvement.

Ever since I've been enrolled at my university, I've moved away from articles, and instead I've been composing for my own satisfaction. The nature of my composition has mostly been journal-like, that is, I would describe my actions and thoughts in the manner presented here. But I would also find myself creating short stories, again for my personal enjoyment. What I find somewhat paradoxical is the fact how most of the composing has actually been done in my mind, and I would always remind myself how I would have to write it down before I forget, but alas I rarely do so. It is as if a strong fear is still gripping me, and if I were to give in myself to my inner desires, I have a feeling I would lose my own self. Still, at times I get an irresistible desire to just write, and were it after a dream in which I would experience the most unusual sensations, and even find myself reading prose in my dreams, – or were it rather while I'm solving problems, and a sudden inspiration strikes me, I find my hand moving of my own accord, and recording my thoughts.

In recent time, I've felt an even stronger pull for writing, perhaps due to the fact how I've been trying to forget my aspirations, taking it for foolishness, listening to idle and mean voices. It is as if someone has attached a string to my heart, and is nudging it ever so firmly each time I ignore my inner self. I've lied to myself for too long, and I've managed to comfront myself and prevent a further suffering. I understand it now how mathematics (more specifically, computer science) may not be the path for me, no matter how much I might have wished it to be, but I would rather have to then turn to my other big love and interest.

I understand how to be an author or a writer, one not necessarily need a degree, but it doesn't negate the fact how I wish one for myself, hence arising the question of what major should I pursue. In truth, only two fall to my mind, those being philosophy and languagues (or literary studies).

When it comes to philosophy, I hadn't realized how much love I had for it until recently. It had also been one of the things I've been trying to ignore, colouring it again to be foolish and listening to the doubts of my associates, but as to not repeat myself too much, I've decided to discard the opinions of the skeptics. Nowadays, I'm enjoying in the classics, and I've mostly been studying Plato and Descartes for now. I'm relishing in their arguments, and I'm drawing out papers of my own accord. I've taken an introductory class to philosophy, and I'm enjoying it immensely. I believe if I were to pursue a degree in philosophy, my options could be varied. For example, if I were to stay in academia, I could take in the study of logic and epistemology, and perhaps even return to my study of mathematics. Or I could take a study in ethics, and I could write about the morality of modern conflicts and war, for example. If I were to work outside academia, I believe I'd prefer a freelance or self-employed position. Or I could finish another major (where I live, double majoring isn't really possible, but I'd rather go for a double degree; a time consuming effort, one that I'm not entirely sure would I like to pursue), and combine whatever skills I were to obtain from studying philosophy to that other discipline. Or I could hope to build a programming portfolio, and strike a junior coding position.

English not being my mother languague, I've always strived towards obtaining a better understanding of it. I wish to obtain a truly commendable ability in my knowledge of the languague, thus hopefully making it ever so easier for me to compose prose. Having this line of thinking lead me thus to consider philology studies, where I would declare English as my major, alongside with a minor in German and Arabic. However, I am uncertain would I enjoy languague studies more so than studying philosophy. I view this matter currently as this: I could always study languagues in my free time, but if I were to focus in philosophy, it would serve to my personal betterment in a more diverse fashion. It's funny how many people tell me the exact opposite, how I could always study philosophy in my own free time, and instead focus on more a marketable major.

As you can see, I've questioned this matter extensively. I have displayed a sort of a portrait of my interests in this self-reflective study, leading me to hope it will help the composition of your comments when you take these facts in consideration. Thank you in advance for the time you might take in reading and responding to my doubts and offering your suggestions and opinions.

*TL;DR.* I thought I loved maths and compsci, but I was wrong. I wish to pursue writing and academia, so I'm considering between philosophy or languagues, despite what all the doubtful voices may say. I am seeking for reassurance, if you please.",college,Changing my major and chasing my dreams,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2z5btl/changing_my_major_and_chasing_my_dreams/,1426466848.0,can't pay for school,11.806666666666668
jgh713,1526326466,/r/college/comments/8jf595/an_education_in_shambles_please_advise/,"Hi.

So, I'm not going to sugar-coat it. I fucked up. Big time.

Lets start in high school. Graduating with a 3.8+ GPA, 2180 on the SATs, breezing through classes, taking career prep (engineering and CS) courses. Not a care in the world. Took a trip Junior year to tour Stanford (as well as my #2 and #3 choices, CalTech and Cal Poly), and everything seemed good.

Fast forward five years, I'm sitting at home, unemployed, my education in shambles, struggling with mental illness, and have no clue what to do at this point.

It started when I missed the application deadline for Stanford. I probably wouldn't have gotten in, but hey, it was my dream, and at least I could have said that I tried. After that point, I decided to go to a local 4-year university (U. Texas at Arlington), as they're a decent school, not too far of a commute, and not ridiculously expensive. I commuted for a year, then lived on campus for a year. At that point, everything fell apart.

*Fall of 2013*

My first semester. Things were fine. I commuted to classes, got my ass kicked by a few professors while trying to come to grips with the transition from high school to college. Ended up with a 2.0 gpa my first semester. Not great, but not unheard of, and still passing.

*Spring 2014*

My second semester of commuting. I flunk one class, then get Cs across the board, bringing my gpa down to 1.85. 

*Summer 2014*

I take some summer courses at a local community college. Get the easy courses out of the way. I'm still slightly together at this point, and these classes are basically show up and pass, so I A/B/B across the board. In hindsight, I should have waited and taken them at the university, to have some hope of pulling my GPA back up, but we're long past that point now.

*Fall 2014*

I move into the dorms. Start living on campus. At this point my ADHD and severe depression kick into overdrive. I stop attending classes after a point in the semester. Stop tending to my health and hygiene. .462 gpa for the semester, bringing me down to a 1.4.

*Spring 2015*

Still living on campus. My roommate is the nicest guy, but probably thinks I'm horrid to live with. Not because I'm an asshole, just because I don't take care of anything. Most of my waking hours are spent wasting away on the computer, either watching endless tv series or playing video games. I fail every single class, mostly because I've stopped caring. My gpa is now at a 1.077, and I am put on dismissal for a semester.

*Summer 2015* 

Take four summer courses at TCC (the aforementioned community college). Withdrawn from all but one for non-attendance. Get a C in the one class I'm not withdrawn from, because I actually enjoyed the teacher. It's somewhere around this point (give or take six months) where my already very very part time job starts to go downhill, and my hours worked go from minimal to nonexistent.

*Fall 2015*

Still on dismissal (one long term, i.e. spring or fall, not just one term), so I take some more courses at TCC. Four courses. Pass three. Fail one (but this one's due to the professor who threatened to file a police report and haul me down to campus police for correcting him in class. no joke. but that's a story for a different time).

*Spring 2016*

Hey, a fresh start! Not really though. Once more, I fail every single class, bringing my gpa at UTA down to 0.848. Aaaaaand, I'm on academic dismissal for a whole 'nother year. So now I'm three years in, on dismissal for the next year, and have completed a total of 28 credit hours at UTA, with some additionals from TCC. Lovely.

Silver lining, this is the semester during which I actually seek help from a medical professional. I've spoken to those close to me (as few as they may be at this point, as I've neglected my social life as much as the rest of my life at this point), I'm on medication to help manage my issues, and I'm also eating less and getting back towards a healthy weight (slowly but surely). But we'll come back to that.

*Summer 2016*

Welp. Back to TCC I suppose. Start working towards that 2-year degree during my fourth year of schooling. Take three classes. Pass two. PhysEd instructor has a thing for pilates and the class starts at 7:30 in the morning, so I said fuck that. Sue me.

*Fall 2016*

Slowly struggling to come to terms with what's happened. Take two classes, pass one, fail the other. Don't even remember why.

*Spring 2017*

Three classes, all passed. Only two courses away from an Associates. Things are looking up!

*Summer 2017*

Took my last two classes. Realized I only needed one of them. Thought I dropped the other, turns out I didn't, so I failed one. But hey, no biggie, summer's over and I've finally got a degree after four years and three months!

*Fall 2017*

Was too late at this point to return to UTA for the fall, so I took a semester off. And by that, I mean I fell off the bandwagon. I stopped taking my meds for several months, and most of my waking hours were spent trying to kill time until I finally got back to the blissful release of sleep.

Towards the end of the semester, I get in touch with UTA, preparing to return in the spring. Am given the runaround for awhile, but finally set up a meeting with a counsellor and talk in person. He basically tells me that at this point, I'll be returning on a provisionary basis, if I fuck up one semester I'm out for good, which I expected. However, I'd also have to go through the University Studies program, which (in his words) is a program for people to get degrees who otherwise wouldn't be able to get those degrees. I'd be spending two more years struggling to pull my GPA out of the trash so that I could even graduate (which he said would probably be possible, but incredibly difficult), all to graduate with a generic degree that's really not going to help me at all. So at this point, what little remains of my plans is just shattered.

*Spring 2017*

So here we are. Me. A several year gap with no work experience. Nothing but a two-year degree and two shitty GPAs to show for it. No clothes for a professional work environment. (That's not entirely true, I have one suit from goodwill with patched holes, and one white dress shirt that you can see through and that's so tight No clue what to do now. I barely have $100 in my bank account (taking into account credit card debt totals me out at about -$1100, actually), so I can't do as people keep telling me and just apply to whatever colleges will take me ($75 application fee on a Texas CommonApp college, seriously UNT?). Hell, even online universities have turned me away out of hand because of my GPA, despite being in direct contact with advisors and filling out supplementary application information and forms to explain my situation and the troubles I've gone through, and honestly I just don't think I can handle much more rejection, be it for schools, jobs, personal interactions, or what have you.

So, yeah. Long story short, I'm a self-taught programmer who can type at 90 words per minute, am a fast learner with a thirst for knowledge, have above-average skill in writing, mathematics, and logical reasoning, and utterly fucked my life up with a 4-year university gpa of 0.84 before being told to shove it, a 2.3 gpa for my Associates from a community college, a multiple-year gap in my employment history (none of which is really applicable to any place I'd ever possibly hope to work), and absolutely zero idea what the fuck to do. I'm so tired of filling out job applications, putting in (sometimes, depending on the job) upwards of an hour just modifying resumes and writing cover letters, and not even hearing back from a place, or getting a two-sentence generic reply. I've spent the past five months sitting at home going back and forth between filling out applications to places I've never heard of and trying to kill the time until I get to just lay down in bed and not worry about things for awhile, mostly either through video games or shitty tv shows. All I want is to be able to support myself. That's all I've ever wanted. Well, that and maybe a dog someday. But, jokes aside, I really just can't do it anymore, and I don't know what to do. If you're still reading at this point, by some miracle, please advise. At this point my post is devolving and like 90% of the reason I'm writing it is just for therapeutic value, but I need something more, man. I just don't know what to do with myself.

I know a few people who frequent this subreddit. If you know who I am, idk. I suppose you deserve to know as much as anyone. I'm just tired of telling everyone around me that everything is going fine because 99% of the time if I don't it's either my fault or it comes off as whiny (varies based on which person I'm talking to, not the situation I'm talking about). But yeah. Idk. Here I am, most of my family estranged, social interactions are down to two or three friends I speak to on a regular basis, and basically terrified of meeting new folks because of how absolutely embarrassed I feel talking about myself (What do you do? Oh. Well, where did you go to school? Oh. Well, do you have any hobbies? Oh, etc etc). I've been hanging by a thread for years, and I've been here for so long that I just don't know how to pull myself up anymore. I know this probably feels like a pity party at this point in the post, and I'm sorry mister or missus internet stranger that actually took the time to read it, I just needed to vent, I guess. I'll let you get back to scrolling through your feed. Hopefully someone has some advice that can help, but just writing this feels like it's helped, even if I haven't clicked submit yet.",college,An education in shambles (please advise),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8jf595/an_education_in_shambles_please_advise/,1526348066.0,school is too expensive,11.786666666666669
[deleted],1353624609,/r/college/comments/13n2e1/the_college_bubble_the_combination_of_economic/,"Since we were young, we've been told that with hard work and determination in high school we would one day make it to college. Once there, if we succeeded with graduating, we'd get a degree which would lead to a well-paying career that would allow us to invest in our future.  With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education. With the economy in a recession and losing over 8 million jobs between the years of 07-09, graduates are struggling in the job market, as well as paying off their student loans (Parker). During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment. The government has tried to help students with government aid and programs for low-income graduates, but has failed to fix the problem. Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates. The president of Yale receives salary that has tripled from $591,709 in 2000, to $1.63 million in 2009 (McArdle). 
	Some experts argue that the rising cost of college tuition is due to federal aid programs. David Schnittger, aide to Education and Workforce Committee, argues that, ""The federal government should not have to automatically subsidize hyperinflation,” that ""there is no pressure on [colleges] to keep their rates down [due to government student tuition assistance programs]"" (Colin). What they don't take into consideration is that government aid is normally only given to low-income students. Middle and upper class students don't receive such aid. So how is it that government funded aid programs are to blame for the rising tuition costs? Now with the average cost of graduating at a 4 year college at $27,293 a year (Parker), it is easy to see who is truly profiting from an attending and/or graduated student. Colleges are capitalizing off students in a poor economy, and once out of college there is no guarantee employment will be waiting. 
	In 2008, Americans lost over 10.4 trillion dollars in the financial crisis. Between 2008-2010 over 8.3 millions of jobs were lost. The government tried bailing out the country with  4.6 trillion dollars and was only able to recover 1.1 million jobs, .9% percent of jobs. That is 4 million dollars in cost for each job recovered (Parker). Boyce Watkins, a finance professor at Syracuse University is quoted saying, ""[College] is certainly an investment. The question is whether or not you get your return on that investment in actual financial capital... [and] this blanket notion that going to college will guarantee you a better economic future is not always true""(Billitteri). In 2009, the numbers were at 12.5 million unemployed, which is 8.1 percent of the American population. The numbers have continuing to rise leaving the total count of unemployed at 17.5 million. With unemployment at the highest it’s ever been in the last 25 years (Katel), it's easy to see that even with the investment of college education, the job market is not in a state of stability leaving the college graduate to take minimal paying jobs, move trades, or move altogether to an area which is hiring. All of which is at a cost to them. 
Many people can't afford to move, so they need jobs to come to them. This is one of the least discussed, most challenging problems in the labor market right now...This is the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began tabulating this data just after World War II. Most of the unemployed—62.3 percent—are out of work because they lost their job, higher than any point since 1982. (Boushey)
Some argue that college degrees do increase the likelihood of getting employment. The fields of healthcare, engineering and computer science have seen a sharp increase of employment within the last five years (Billitteri). However, are all students obligated to study in fields that are hiring so that they may make a high enough income to pay back student loans? If so, where will our educational teachers, earth science specialists and art specialists come from? Chances are these programs will lose funding. All these degree areas are feeling the economic downturn, does that mean that all students should have to pursue a degree that they don't wish to pursue, in order to guarantee enough income to pay back their student loans? Part of the American dream is to pursue what your passionate about, not to conform to the demands of society. Though some argue it is because of the student's degree choice, if all students were to graduate in a degree that was hiring, wouldn't that cause an abundancy of applicants? Making the job market for those jobs hiring like the rest, not hiring? College graduates not only face the outrageous cost of tuition but once finishing their degree they are stuck in a dead end job market which they cannot avoid. 
	With both college tuition and unemployment at record highs, it is not hard to see why the college loan system is failing. What once was the American dream has now turned into the national debt. With colleges spending too much on non-educational expenses and leaving their students to flip the bill in this economic downfall, it’s no wonder the college loan system is not helping the college graduate. The college loan system has to not only take into consideration the economy's state but the college's spending. While the nation is trying to recover and grow from the current recession it is important to recognize that student borrowing is working against our economic interests and the source of why that is happening. In order for the college graduate to pay off their debt, there must be employment after college and if that is not a guarantee, colleges must reevaluate their expenditures. Until the economy recovers from its current crisis, student debt will only worsen and end up not only costing the American graduate, but the nation as a whole.

[deleted],1353624609,/r/college/comments/13n2e1/the_college_bubble_the_combination_of_economic/,"Since we were young, we've been told that with hard work and determination in high school we would one day make it to college. Once there, if we succeeded with graduating, we'd get a degree which would lead to a well-paying career that would allow us to invest in our future.  With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education. With the economy in a recession and losing over 8 million jobs between the years of 07-09, graduates are struggling in the job market, as well as paying off their student loans (Parker). During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment. The government has tried to help students with government aid and programs for low-income graduates, but has failed to fix the problem. Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates.

[deleted],1293931008,/r/AskReddit/comments/euqka/dear_reddit_i_need_advice_on_marriage_and/,"As the title says, I'm in need of any advice on marriage and financial counseling. My parents have long needed help and have finally agreed to seek professional help after a blow up fight led to a meaningful discussion today. I'm looking at types of counseling or what the best path would be because I have no idea. Full story is below. I feel it's best to read the whole thing to have a good idea on the events leading up to this need for help and the personalities of my parents. Thank you very much and I appreciate any and all input. 

I'm 22 years old and all of my older siblings are also moved out of the house, so it's just my parents at home. They're glorified roommates who sleep in different rooms. They're two different personalities; my father is very stern and fiscally conservative while my mother is very emotional and fiscally spontaneous. My father is a farmer and a wizard with financial management, so we're pretty well off in terms of money, but money is also the root of the problem. My mom grew up poor and thus has always been very spontaneous with her money. 

When I was three, my mom had racked up ~$10,000 in credit card debit behind my dad's back. Eventually my dad of course found out, which led to very verbal and intense fighting between my parents (still ingrained into my head to this day). My dad paid off her debts in full. Four years later my mom again racked up more credit card debt to the tune of $15,000. Again, massive amounts of fighting ensued and my dad then paid it off. Now I want to say now that none of the fights have ever gotten physical nor were there any emotionally abusive insults thrown back and forth. Just a lot of screaming and crying. Everything went alright for about another five years until my mom got involved with my eldest sister, Kim. Kim is my half-sister and my father's step-daughter. When my parents married, Kim was 12 years old and my father and her have never been close. As sad as it is, she is visibly loved more by my mother than my father due to their strained relationship.

Kim has been a very emotionally weak person and was going through a rough marriage with an asshole of a husband. She developed anorexia and attempted suicide a couple, including OD'ing in front of my mother and I, so needless the say she had a pretty rough life. Eventually she divorced her husband and sought professional help and is now -stable.- After the divorce and help, Kim felt empowered and wanted to go back to college. This is where my mother comes in. 

Kim herself did not have a lot of money built up in her name. She had her LPN and decided to go get her RN. She chose a very expensive private college and my mother co-signed on the loans. Throughout my sister's rebuilding, my mother also ""financed"" her new apartment, all furniture, etc. A while after finishing college, Kim needs another guy (asshole v2.0), gets married, and moves to California. Kim all the while made a single payment on her loans and other ""debt"" she had developed via my mother. So my mom being the cosigner gets attacked by collection agencies and begins to make payments on the loans herself by pulling money out on credit cards. All was done, again, behind my father's back. 

Fast forward to present day and my mother has racked up ~$250,000 in credit card debt, while my purchases centered around my sister Kim provide probably 90% of it. My mother continues to give money to my sister as she feels Kim is too vulnerable and will resort back to deep depression should she be too stressed. My mom never discusses the debt with Kim for fear of a relapse, Kim continues to spend cluelessly, and my mother continues to fork over money. My father found out about the debt about five years ago and they again constantly argue. Their relationship has deteriorated to the point of nothing. My father of course now has no trust and an unexplainable amount of frustration, while my mother has developed an entitled, victimized attitude due to my father's judgment all of the time and refuses to discuss the debt.

Now I know the obvious answer through the entire store is ""divorce!"" However, my parents are in rather a catch 22. My father is a farmer and owns a large portion of his land. Through that and his machinery, it yields to a very large amount of illiquid investment. Should my mom file for divorce, my dad must sell everything he owns in order to convert it to cash and give my mother half. He refuses to do this, so he continues to put up with my mom and argue about the debt. My mother on the other hand uses my father to pay off her debt (he gives her approximately $3,000 a month for this purpose) so she does not want to get a divorce, either. She feels that even should she get a divorce, it would not be the amount of money she would need to pay her debt plus she makes a very meager income on her own. 

During our discussion today, I called my father out on his attitude throughout the entire thing. My father is very emotionless and I have yet to hear the words ""I love you"" from him once. He is VERY judgmental and still remains one of the only persons to able to drive me to a balling little bitch. He judges on every decision he does not see as a wise purchase, but is very financially conservative so most purchases he sees as unwise. Anyway, his emotionless also translates into how he treats my mother: he never really kissed her, rarely said ""I love you"" to her throughout my memory, was never really able to support her on an emotional level, etc etc. My mom's problem is obvious. However, the problem is not just the debt. My mother continues to spend, more on herself than my sister now, but has admitted she has a problem. She does not want to talk to my dad because he can never have a civil conversation about it (though I cannot blame him). Being an emotional person, her needs have never really been meant through my father and I believe this is a large part to why she continues to spend and refuses to talk to my father about the issue now. Spending is her only outlet to make her feel worthy. 

So we have two issues: the coldness of my dad and the absolute clusterfuck of a financial situation my mom has spawned to address. My parents can't accomplish shit on their own, which is why I screamed at them today through tears to promise they would seek professional help for me. My dad is very open to the idea, as he is at his last rope. I told both of them that divorce may ultimately be the best idea, but doing it now in my eyes is a terrible idea. I am not looking to rectify their situation and return their marriage to bliss; obviously, I feel that is very unlikely. What I am trying to do is get them both more in the middle and see eye to eye. I want my father to understand the lack of emotion my mother has went through for a very long time, understand how his constantly judgmental tone belittles a person so much, and be able to see why my mother may have spent so much on my sister out of concern she would go back into depression. No mother wants to see their daughter suffer like that or kill themselves and will go to extreme ends to drive away even the slightest thoughts of that happening. Regarding my mother, I want her to get help with her addiction to quit spending and to fully understand why my father is furious. I want her to see how her actions effect not only her and my sister, but everyone in the family. I would ultimately like her to no longer hide from her debt, but to confront it, admit she has a problem, and take care of it. I want her to see that although she is being a very caring mother, there are other ways to help Kim without constantly giving her money. She needs to see that Kim needs to grow up on her own and that she needs to ""cut the cord."" Overall for both of them, I again want them to just be brought more from the opposing extreme ends in which they currently reside and move more into the middle, with my father becoming more empathetic and my mother more responsible. I feel this is necessary not just for the sake of their problem, but for individual personal development as well (ie, my father DOES need to be more empathetic and my mother more realistic in life in general).  I want this to happen so that should they divorce, they will be able to be able to civilly and in peace so that our family can still get along. I fear that should they get a divorce now, my mother will take my father for everything he has and everything will implode emotionally and materialistically (the farm, etc.). Today, they both agreed and said they wanted help to reduce any further damage and possibly (although this is doubtful) to make them care about each other enough to again enjoy their marriage.

So reddit, after this long and convoluted read, this is why I come to you. I want my parents to get joint marriage counseling to address the overall problem emotionally and fiscally. Additionally, my mother NEEDS financial counseling and I think that my father would greatly benefit from singular emotional counseling as well. They are finally willing to work together through professional help and this is their chance, but none of us know where to go or start. Has anybody else been in similar situation? What type of counseling should they seek first or what would your advised path be? 

I'm sorry this was so long and sloppily put together, but thank you very much for reading.

I have been harassed. Pretty badly and I have seen no results when I have tried to get help. 

It started last spring (2011). I was driving home with a friend, it was around 11 o'clock and it was very dark. As we pulled into my drive way, we could see that there was a lot of stuff all over the place. At first we started laughing because it didn't seem so bad. When we got out of the car to start picking it up we realized what was scattered across my front lawn was stolen construction cones from a construction site up the road, and a ton of For-Sale house signs with all of the pamphlets thrown everywhere. There was also some of my mothers outdoor lights that had been taken out of the ground and smashed. Then I looked up to my doorway. Sitting there was a large street cone. It, and my front door were covered in sticky notes. As I got closer I saw that they were in at least three different hand writings with things written on them such as ""fuck you,"" ""you're a douch,"" ""I want to pee on you,"" and so on. There were many of these. 

Barely able to myself from crying, I gathered up all of the trash, stolen equipment and hate notes and brought them inside of my house. I told my friend that I would be alright, so he left. Neither of my parents were home. 

When both of my folks came back, we pieced together a time line. Whoever had attacked my house had waited for my parents to leave and managed to mess up my entire front yard and post a ton of sticky notes within about seven minutes (before I came home). 

My mother called the police and an officer showed up at my house. He was rather aggressive and persisted in asking me ""who did this?"" and I kept telling him I didn't know. I didn't want to falsely accuse someone by blindly guessing. He ended up taking pictures of the notes, told my mom that not much was going to happen to her broken property and told us to call the city to reclaim the cones. He finished by saying that he saw this as a school related event and so he would turn it over to my resource officer. 

The next few days I was never contacted by my resource officer. The high school rumor mill started to churn and finally I was provided with some names. I went to the officer and told him what I had been told by one of the best friends of the people who had attacked my house. He still did nothing. 
I went in a week later to see if he had acted upon my new information and he said that he had been too busy and that he would get to it. I waited. Nothing. My mother called the school. Nothing. She called the police again. They affirmed us that the resource officer would deal with it. 

A few days later I get a message on facebook from a girl who I had been friends with. She starts telling me how much I bother her and how much she hates what I do and say. I tell her I am sorry, if she really has that big of a problem with me, I will try to change and that she doesn't have to be around me or be friends with me on Facebook. She goes on a bit more about how annoying I am, comments on a few of my posts from other days and then stops. 

This all happened in early April. Late May rolls around and I decide to re-download twitter on my phone (I had deleted it because I hadn't been using it). I am greeted with around 25 notifications that my twitter had been mentioned in other tweets. I had never had this kind of response. I start to open up the links and to my horror they are from a twitter that is in my name followed by profanity about me sucking ass and a group of people hating me. The tweets were responses to my own tweets from months before, and they talked about how happy ""they""  were (whoever the creator(s) was/were) when I wouldn't show up to school, or how they wanted to shit on me, or how they had a ""fag in their radar."" I should clarify that I am not homosexual, but I have been called gay a fair number of times throughout the years for my interest in choir and theater. 

I finished looking through the tweets and then showed my mom. She was furious. Once again she called the police. They asked us to print out the tweets so they could come by and pick them up. We did so. An officer was supposed to show up that afternoon. A few days passed, so my mom called back and asked when an officer would come. We were told soon, two weeks passed. She called again. Same response. The cops never showed up. 

Things started to calm down for a while. But clearly in this time, the people who had been harassing me started to get comfortable. One morning while watching the morning news (which I was on every morning because of having a student leadership role) one of my attackers turned to one of my close friends and told her that he had ""fucked with that faggot's house and got away with it."" When I was told this, I reported it to the resource officer. Nothing happened. 

Then, a few weeks later they became even more bold, and a girl came up to me as I was rehearsing lines for a play. She was making a painting that I would be using as a prop. I asked her how the painting looked. She told me it looked ""shitty, like me. So it is all very fitting"". 

I didn't respond. I just looked away. I just felt like dying at that point. These people were being so vicious. They had attacked me in so many ways. And yet they were never getting punished. There was no justice. 

This spring, almost exactly a year after my house was first messed with, I received a call. I was sitting with friends watching tv at around 9 o'clock at night. I woke up my phone and saw that I had a voice mail from a blocked number. I start to play it. In it I am called a faggot at least 5 times, I am cursed at throughout the entity of the approximately 30 second message and I am made fun of for the plays and choir that I involve myself in. The message is extremely hateful. 

I went home. I showed my mom and dad. I was crying and screaming out of fear and rage. I showed my mother and once again she called the police. They told is that they would not deal with it and that it would have to go to my school. So, this time my mom brings it to my school. And to her dismay, she discovers that not only had the school resource office never follow up with any of my attackers, but he had also never even informed the administration of my school about what had been happening to me. The assistant principal was not too happy about this. She brought him in for a three person meeting. I showed them the voice mail. She was really wanting to catch the person who did this, the resource officer looked at us and said it was impossible because it was a blocked number, so that was that. He then turned to me and said, ""wait, you're the kid who came to me before and then had your mom come in right? Now, why do you think these people are always getting after YOU?""

He said this as if I deserved this, as if I had it coming. As if it wasn't really a problem. As if he was not at fault in any way for letting it continue to happen. 



I graduated. I had to see these people who have made me want to kill myself, who made me fall into medically considered ""severe depression,"" who made me spend weeks with a counselor, I had to watch these people trot across the stage, never getting any sort of punishment. There was no justice. They were able to make my life a living hell and they got to enjoy every minute of it. 

So here I am. I haven't slept the same for over a year now because I am afraid. I used to feel safe at home. Now, when I am on trips I cry when I have to come home (what 19 year old boy should cry when he comes home?!) I wake up every morning and go to my window to make sure that my yard isn't scattered with trash and vile notes, again. I check my twitter (which I wish I could delete, but it holds evidence) and make sure that there are no new responses, I check my voicemails and Facebook to make sure nothing new has cropped up. This is the worst way to live. 

I finally contacted an attorney, he told me to peruse this, it would be rather expensive. Sadly, my family is not incredibly well off, especially as they are about to send me off to college, and after they covered some of the counseling sessions. We have contacted twitter to see if they could help us at all, but we have yet to hear back (nearly two months later), and my school clearly gave up on any efforts that had on figuring out and punishing my attackers.  

At this point I have no idea what to do. I feel so helpless. The only support I have is my mom and dad. The police have been absolutely useless, the school was incredibly unhelpful and the lawyer I talked to confirmed that it was out of my price range to afford legal help. I feel so lost. 

Help me reddit. What can I do? 

TL;DR I have been pretty brutally harassed for over a year and my school and the police never pursued the issue despite constant pleading.

Xenatian,1521184031,/r/college/comments/84tlmp/need_advicehope_im_not_the_only_one/,"Hey y'all. So I'm a sophomore Mechanical Engineering major at a big college, but I'm an out of state student. Which means most of my ""friends"" from high school are back a in-state schools. I ha a rough time socially in high school due to health and because of my health, I didn't smoke or drink, and I think my friends though I would snitch on them if I as around them doing that, so I lost pretty much most of my friends my junior year. Didn't go to parties, everytime I tried to hang out, I get rejected, and all the party kids were my teammates on the baseball team. I also barely played any baseball, the thing I love as much as my family, because of my coach though I hate become weak after I was sick, and didn't think I could play anymore. Long story short, high school sucked. So I was kind of glad I went to an out of state school so I could no longer be around that cancer, started a new life. I was really excited to rush and join a fraternity to be part of the party life, make new friends, and compensate for what I missed out on in high school. At the same time, I was experiment with adding and dropping classes, and dropped a class for my major, Chemistry 1, on accident and couldn't find a time or days I could take it that semester, so I was already behind in my schedule before I even started college. I also didn't get into the fraternity I wanted a dropped, which I regret not being more open minded and just choosing one. To add insult to injury, my roommate facetimed his girlfriend every night, and went home weekends we didn't have home football games. I thought college was, or specifically my college, was going to be easy because its a school in the South, so you know, not much intelligence. I was wrong, and ended up with a 2.6 GPA. I was devastated, and sort of got a wake up call. The only good thing about that semester was my joining a club and finding a community through them. The next semester wasn't any better. My friend wanted me to rush so I could be in his fraternity, and didn't get a bid from them or any other frat, so another semester of no partying, making friends, or girls. I was jealous of all the guys having fun of the frats having fun an I couldn't have that kind of fun as well. Also no fun Spring Break plans. My GPA was a little better, only because I only had two classes to my degree plan, which I ended up having to dropping a class again, Calculus 1, meaning I was now a semester and a half behind in my second semester of college. I just had a bunch of electives to boost my GPA. By May, I was so glad to move out, but I couldn't transfer to my dream school, The University of Texas at Austin, because my GPA was too low. My summer was ok. I tried to take summer classes but that ended up not working out, so I couldn't catch up and that bummed me out so much because I couldn't imagine any of my friends already being behind by the end of their freshman year of college. I moved into an apartment this year, and even though I have friends, I didn't really consider too many of them as close enough friends to be roommates with, and those that I wanted to be my friends already had arrangements. So I had to roommate match, which they've, until recently, have been better than last year's roomate. Rushed again, assuming I was going to be in my friend's frat, because he said I would be a shoe-in, and not only did I not get a bid from them, but none of the other frats here. So another semester of no fun, no friends, and no girls, whereas freshman are getting into frat with no problems because they know people and get to live the life I wanted all 4 years of college. I, at most could, only be in a frat for 2 1/2 years, (probably going to be a 5, maybe 6 year student so maybe 3 or 4 years after all). Classes this semester were fine, but I tripped up on some tests and ended up with a 2.8 GPA by Christmas. The club I was part of started to drive me crazy, but at some point that half the classes I scheduled for this semester go toward a minor in Business Administration, so I thought that was cool, and am now pursuing that. I also realized that it would be easier for me to get an MBA at my from school that a Master in ME from Texas. So now, here I am, having signed a bid to a frat but not being able to do anything  or meet any of my brother's or pledge brothers because of the school's President cancelling then deciding to do Spring Rush, but not having decided when, and because it's halfway through the semester, I'm assuming they won't do it, so 2 years wasting my college time not being in a frat and having a small social life and group of good friends. I did make it a resolution to be more outgoing, which did work, but not to the amount that I wanted, and I haven't really studied or hungout with these people, just good friends in my class. So here we are today, after dropping another class that I need, Physics 1, after I, and everyone else bombed the test Monday, and just signed a lease at another complex without any friends to be my roommates, so doing roommate matching agin, only praying that my future roommates are close to my preference, let alone guys in my fraternity, so I already regret signing it, and not staying at my current complex  in another room or another complex because their closer closer, and a number of other reasons. I'm also upset that I keep dropping classes and wasting my parents money, as well as not progressing a my degree plan and getting closer to graduating. I'm upset that I don't or haven't had any of my friends become my roommates, I'm a pessimist and depressed because I always think that nothing will work-out for me since nothing has since my junior year of high school. I know that I'm depressed, everyone does, but I refuse to see a therapist because I know that I'm too stubborn and pessimistic to listen to their advice because I don't possible see how it'll improve my life. I don't go out to the bars on the weekends because I don't really have friends to go with. I tried going by myself a few times because of my resolution, and it's intimidating going by yourself, especially if you don't have a fake, because, for me, it's easier to talk to people, especially girls when I'm buzzed. Also bars quickly get expensive, are loud, and without being in a frat, I can't drink, so I stay in on the weekends, which upsets my parents. They want me to be more social. I know my priorities are out of whack, and I wish I could change that, but the party scene is so big at my school, that it's hard to not think about it. I could motivate myself with the money from my future career, which ironically, I know what to do, Reservoir Engineer, but it hasn't. I also want to get into McCombs School of Business at Texas to ge my MBA so it makes it easier to go up my future company's chain of command, which is hopefully Shell, ExxonMobil, or other big name oil companies, but for those companies I need at least a 3.2 GPA, and to get into McCombs, a 3.4. I'm also afraid about life after graduating because it seems so monogamous, waking up, go to work, go home, eat, sleep. I've heard that the social party life gets better after college because now you have money to do what I want, but I find that hard to believe because I'm no longer around college girls, and there aren't frat parties to go to anymore, only bars, an even that, to me, starts to look monogamous. That my pessimism showing again. I've heard to slowly become an optimist, I should write down at least 3 good things that happened everyday, but I can't even think of three things.I just want to hear what yall have to say, but typically when I post stuff, I get negative comment from people which is extremely unhelpful, so just advice or, hopeful stories that hopefully I'm not the only one facing these struggles.

Edit:Most of my friends are in Greek Life, and seeing everything that they're doing on Snapchat and Instagram makes me feel bad because I know that also should be me, but it isn't me, and it gets me really sad that I'm not spending my time in college like that. Another thing I worry/get upset about is that freshman, who are taking Calculus 2, Chemistry 2, and Physics 1, are making these classes look easy, or aren't struggling nearly as hard as I am in classes that I'm currently in, and it urks me how they get it and get better grades, and I don't. Another thing is for most engineering students, it takes 5 years on average to graduate, but I feel like it'll take me 5 1/2-6 years to graduate, whereas my other friends, college or high school friends, even those who are also engineering majors, will have already graduated and have a job, while I'll still be in school, making me feel like an idiot compared to them. Now I've heard you shouldn't worry about what others are doing or thinking about you, only worry about you and yourself, but for me, its a lot easier said than done because I want to impress and outdo other

Randomscreename,1341112151,/r/AskReddit/comments/vv3x1/im_about_to_hit_rock_bottom_how_can_i_turn_my/,"Please brace yourself, as this is long. I dont know where else to look for help anymore. 


For the past year, I have been struggling with personal, financial, and mental health issues. This all started around May of last year when my employer at the time found a job for me (there was no more room for growth at our little store) working for HP on their new mobile phone division. After multiple interview rounds, I was offered the job. For the job, I had to travel to visit store locations daily, and would be travelling over 750 miles a week. My car at the time was falling apart, and since I would be receiving a significant increase in pay, I spent my savings on getting a new car for the job. 


Fast forward 6 weeks, and the new HP product (the HP Veer and Touchpad) were a huge flop. My position was eventually eliminated, and I was stuck with a vehicle I could not afford. At this time, I was able to return to my previous job part-time, and work part-time for a friends start up business. It was tough, but between me and my girlfriend, we were able to maintain payments on bills and the like. By Novemeber, my friends startup business hit the rocks, and my old job was all I had. 

At this point, things between my girlfriend and I were stressed, but she was able to pick up more hours, and I went on the hunt for a new job. It was at this time where I sought medical attention for depression, as I used to be on medication in high school. I was being paid under the table at my old job so that I could start claiming unemployment for my years worked at the previous job (because I had not been with HP for a full 3 months, I could not claim unemployment from them). I refused to claim it as of yet because I was ""to proud"" to take handouts for something I felt I didn't deserve (I understand how unemployment payments work, but I did not think I would be out of a job for too long). It was around December when money started to become tighter, and serious budget cuts came in (no fast food, no going bowling or spending unnecessary money, no Xmas gifts, etc.). Keep in mind I am a 22 year old working slightly above minimum wage, so budgeting is something I do on a normal basis. Add to this my girlfriend working two jobs (she has managed to keep her first job ever for 5 years, and pick up hours there when needed) for minimum wage as well. We were able to handle it. 


Come late January I was able to go back nearly full time at my old job. Money to pay off the credit card debt accumulated for paying the bills was starting to come in, and our tax refunds totalled about 3 thousand dollars. This helped take care of half of our combined debt (mostly mine, as all the utilities/food/general expenses have been under my name). I also sought assistance from my parents to help pay the car bill, as that was/is the most expensive monthly bill we have to deal with, besides ret. We do not come from rich families, but our families were helping with this as well as buying food from Costco for us occasionally for the day-to-day necessities. Once again, things are tight, but we were still able to handle it.


The middle of March rolls around, and due to lack of business at the store I work at, I am asked to step down. At this time, I was able to start making some extra cash fixing cell phones and reselling them on the side. Because our store only had four people (the owner, her son, a bilingual speaker, and me), I left and tried to make things work on my little side hustle. Things went well for a month, and I continued to seek a normal job, but no one in my area will hire. Trust me when I say I have applied to over 150 places, ranging from burger king, to car dealerships, to other retail stores, to receptionists, to management, to delivering pizzas. If I hear back from a place, they tell me they have already found someone more qualified for the position. 

I am not an unqualified person. I am currently attenting school for my bachelors in business management and administration, have a net+ certification along with some other computer certifications, 2 years management experience (both with back-room management and direct reporting scenarios), 4 years CSR, retail sales, and tech support. Add to that one year of interning as a tech 1 support rep for a 150 computer system company, I feel I have a well rounded job persona (if anyone has a job in southwest Florida that you need done, I would be happy to message you my resume). 


Continuing on, my little side business was doing okay, pulling in enough money for me to start paying off the rest of my debt, along with day to day expenses for the next couple of months. However, perhaps from the general stress of school, trying to run my own business, and maintain a personal life/rebuild a social life due to lack of contact with people over the past months, I fell into a very bad depressive period. At that time my phone sales faltered, and I fell ever so slowly behind on being able to pay bills. 

Fast forward to the current day. I have taken up unemployement paychecks finally (which do help cover some expenses, but not enough). My side business is faltering (no one is selling their devices, regardless of local advertisement flyers and using Craigslist/making connections, etc.) my girlfriend is working 70 hours a week and I cannot find a job. Debt is piling up, regardless of what I try and do. Im falling behind in school.


We spend no more than 100 a week for food for the two of us, if not less. We don't splurg (I have only splurged twice in the last year; once for mothers day, and once for a really good week of repair sales, which I thought was the turnaround of all the bad things). My girlfriend and I spend gas to get to work and school, nothing else (unless our parents host a free meal occasionally). I don't know where to cut more costs, as I have cut tv/phone/Internet costs to bare minimum. 


I don't feel I am emphasizing how bad things are for us right now. We have no money, I have no job, girfriend is working twice as hard and not being able to make ends meet. I have sold things such as our tv, smartphones, anything worth value. We will just be able to cover rent this coming month, and go until the 15th before having money for anything else. We both are stressed out constantly for lack of funds, and I find myself in a very dark place after being rejected job after job, or not receiving calls back. I have tried distracting myself with what little things we have left (I have a fish tank I got fish in from a friend, Internet for job searching/reddit/free online games). I feel the need to call the suicide hotline, as I feel my medication is no longer helping as much as it should. I will be seeking medical help this follwing week, as long as I have enough gas in the tank to make it to the clinic. We stockpiled pastas and other cheap foodstuffs with the money we had. Bills keep on coming, credit cards maxed to pay them. 


The final blow that brings me to writing this was getting a speeding ticket today while going to sell a phone. We spent the last 4 hours crying and trying to figure out where else I could apply to, or to see if I could get a business loan to open up my own store with an associate I know for an additional location for his restaurant (it is something I strongly believe in, and feel am 80% ready for, apart from reviewing the final aspects for). 

I don't know where to turn. I can't land a job interview, my side hustle is faltering, and I don't have funds to go and start my own legit business. How can I turn my life around and get things going the right way? 

This is the last glimmering thing I hold onto as hope, apart from my girlfriend staying next to me for these hard times. I realize there are situations out there worse than mine, but I've tried dealing with changing my life on my own to no avail. I'm trying to avoid losing my car, getting evicted, and ending up on the street. 


I will be posting in /assistance as well, because frankly, I need a job/money to pay the bills, and have no other options. If anyone has a steady job or part time work they need done in the southwest Florida area, please message me. 

TL;DR - Broke, unemployed, stressed, meds not working. Need advice, job, or a miracle. 



Edit: For all those saying move out of Florida, I am currently tied here through school, and the fact that after rent, we will have $37 to our name until the 15th. I will be looking into food stamps, and thank people for all the PM's/messages about online jobs and the like. I am reading through them all and going to start some of them asap.

As for the meds, I am currently on a high dose of Pristiq, as it seems to work for me while many others don't (pretty much everything else just makes me sleepy or give me unusual heart rate). I'm not going to go cold turkey, as those who have been diagnosed with depression understand how even missing one day of meds can make you feel. 


As for the girlfriend, I plan on letting her read all these comments when she gets home from work and seeing how truly awesome she is. I really appreciate the comments, and am fortunate to hear others have been in my shoes and made it out positively. ",AskReddit,I'm about to hit rock bottom.

bozongle,1523249591,/r/college/comments/8avydk/im_failing_all_my_classes_and_only_recently/,"This is sort of a cry for help because I have no idea how to resolve anything I've done to myself over the past few months in such a short period of time, and my future is looking to be full of despair.

For background, I'm a first-generation Indian-American student with strict Indian parents who were academic studs and went from being nothing to achieving great success in the US. 

As a result, I was brought up to be academic-oriented and they constantly reinforced me to get good grades, do well in school, join academic clubs, etc. And it worked, for the most part. High school was structured in a way where low effort yet high talent led me to succeed. I would procrastinate every assignment yet complete them just in time to get a high grade, I was an amazing test-taker and studying for an hour or two the night before a big exam could get me an A. My constant success academically in high school overshadowed the fact I had no hobbies, no interest in anything other than to be social (I'm a very sociable person and getting rejected socially throughout high school is one of the prominent reasons of my depression/anxiety) and basically did the minimum to keep up my standard of being a smart Indian kid while also partying and trying to make friends (I won't get into detail about this, but my struggle with this damaged me beyond repair). 

At the end of it all, I graduated with a 4.43 GPA, a 35 on my ACT (which was enforced by constant tutoring by a very expensive tutor which my parents probably didn't have the money to be spending on), and a myriad of school club accomplishments. Yet, I procastinated my college and scholarship essays to the point where I didn't get into any of the twelve colleges I applied nor got any scholarships except for my safety state university (they gave me a $40,000 scholarship based on my GPA) which I am studying at now.

I was (and still am) a foolish kid, and college independence was huge. No longer was I constantly harassed by my parents about academics, I was finally allowed to go out on my own whim and take contorl of my life. At first, college was a breath of fresh air, but then everything came crashing down once responsibilities overwhelmed me. Essays, exams, homework, scholarships (my parents, although middle-class, have a lot of commitments financially and thus need any financial support I can get), socializing with people, friendships, past memories of hardship, all sorts of different stresses and pressures overwhelmed me. So I did what I do best: avoid it all. I started skipping class and procrastinating HW assignments, overconfident that I was able to do it in high school all the time. After I did it a little, I got away with making up/bullshitting assignments at first. But, college is nothing like HS. High school had structure, and was enforced discipline - even if I procrastinated HW, I still was forced to sit in classes and pay attention for 8 hours a day. My life had no such discipline or structure, and as such I let everything go to shit. I started partying more and more because I had few such opportunities in high school but then found myself not enjoying any of it because of my constant anxiety about others' thoughts of me and my actions. I started withdrawing from others and just overall my life once I hit a snowball effect of just skipping class, trying to party and be accepted by various friend groups, and just having no motivation or energy to do anything at all - I literally tried to just find instant gratification in anyway possible. This led to me skipping class every week and I turned into a stoner. I convinced myself I was a lazy bastard from all the drugs and partying and after an Adderall binge before finals week, I recovered my grades just enough above the 3.0 GPA requirement for my scholarship; I got a 3.16.

Going to a safety school, my parents expected a 3.9/4.0. I felt like a complete failure and decided I would recover it next semester, and take up healthy and positive habits in order to make sure I did. By committing to this, I felt that telling my parents at the end of the year I got a 3.6/3.7 balanced out would be better than telling them the truth. So what did I do? Faked my transcript, and told them I got a 4.0, and they weren't even surprised they literally told me it was ""expected.""

Then, winter break came, and this was a very depressive period for me. I got rejected again by the people I thought were my friends (didn't invite me to any parties, didn't respond to my messages) and literally spent 21 straight days doing nothing but sleeping and playing Fortnite. I didn't even enjoy fortnite; I did it to pass the time.


This trend continued into the next semester, I took easier classes so I thought things would go easy, and I got caught up in my overconfident avoidance mindset. Long story short, I fell into a web of drug use, lying, avoiding responsibility, and trying to figure things out on my own before I finally hit the lowest point - I spent 3 weeks in a row skipping class, sleeping in until 4 PM, didn't enjoy or want to do anything, not play video games, not do drugs, or party, just stay in bed and do nothing, and finally went 48 hours straight without eating anything - because I had no energy or motivation to even get up and walk 2 minutes to the dining hall and eat. I decided it was enough, went to CAPS (Counseling and Psycholigical Services) and after breaking down and crying to my psychologist for 40 minutes about my problems and my life, he very easily diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and also possible ADD.

This diagnosis was less than a month ago, and everything makes sense to me now. I've had depression for years but was able to cope because of the structure of my life in high school, but once that structure was gone, everything fell apart and I didn't realize that I needed help. I didn't think it was depression no matter how much I researched the issue - I want to be a psychiatrist and had helped my best friend, the one person besides my girlfriend who is closest to me, through his depression, even to the point where he was about to commit suicide and I was the one to talk him out of it. I always consider my self a lazy piece of shit, and I think I am truly - that depression is another excuse.

But, when I'm talking to my therapist, it all feels to real and his points hit me hard and genuinely I need therapy to improve. I got a job and started making progress in being productive, and felt so good about working a 65 hour work week last week and working another 38 hours this week. I work close every night, get a good 7 hours of sleep, and still have been struggling to go to class but I've been doing better. Small steps have helped me lift myself out of this depression, but the damage of my ignorant self has been done. a 3.16 GPA first semester, and now - Ds/Fs in 3 of my classes and a C- in one class with only a month of my semester left (with a bunch of missing assignments, attendance/participation points lost, exams coming up that I have no idea how to study for because they cover months of material). I feel like I have trapped myself - my parents will freak the moment they find out about my grades, let alone the depression, or loss of scholarship. I love this university and don't want to leave and do NOT want to go to community college/local college - please don't suggest this I've already considered this. I don't technically have a medical diagnosis, as the soonest psychiatric consultation in my collegetown is in the summer, and of course I'm under my parents' insurance so they would notice the bill. Everything's crashing down on me and I genuinely feel there is nothing but despair in my life coming for me - my therapist told me to reach out to an advisor/professors about my options but having no medical diagnosis, being so late in the semester, and still struggling to balance everything in my life and still having a habit of procrastination has made everything so much harder, let alone the thought of my awful grades, or losing my scholarship, or my parents going bezerk and withdrawing me and sending me to some Indian school. It sucks, because just as I finally started to understand what I needed to get out of this horrible phase of my life, the consequences of my past actions are keeping me in it.


I just don't know what to do. I just want to be able to get past this semester, improve myself over the summer, and come back better prepared mentally next semester with a scholarship and perform up to the academic standards I used to set myself to. But with no interests or passions, and pursuing a pre-med career simply because of my parents' desires (although the desire for psychology is true and valid), and my terrible academic record and loss of scholarship, I feel like I fucked myself over really hard. And this is an expression of all of that. I need help, I'm sorry if this was too long to read - I just thought details would help to understand my situation. **tl;dr:** after fucking around and trying to avoid my problems for my freshman year, I hit my lowest point and have been (nonmedically) diagnosed with depression/anxiety that was the root cause - but the damage is done and I will lose my scholarship (minimum 3.0 gpa) and end up with a sub 2.5 gpa this year, and my future is pretty bleak. I'm not suicidal but it's hard to get those thoughts with such a future in sight.

He is the best man I know, and I am immeasurably lucky to have had him guide me to where I am now in life, which is a freshman at a great university. He also went to college. He worked two jobs to pay for it himself while maintaining a good enough GPA to apply to law school, in which he also worked multiple jobs. I don't work while at school, but I do 40 hours a week in the summers. My father grew up poor. Really poor. Hispanic kid in 60s California and Illinois trying to make ends meet poor. 11 siblings that all ate the same thing every day and didn't complain because they knew how hard their parents worked to put food on the table poor. I grew up asking for ten bucks to drive through Culver's with my friends. I grew up asking for something else if the dinner he made me wasn't what I wanted. My dad worked from 6 am to 8 pm picking cucumbers in 80-degree heat when he started middle school. I got my own laptop when I started sixth grade. My dad works long days, sometimes six days a week, at his office and has prosecuted more cases than most of his coworkers combined over his career. I go to frat parties and get so drunk that I have to go the hospital. I woke up this morning in the ER with an IV winding its way down my arm and my clothes in a bag behind the bed I was in. I loathe myself. My father brought me up strong, showed by example what a man should be, raised up good men in my eyes, and talked about his love for God so strongly that when I was young that I wanted to be a priest. Sometimes, when the world seems very quiet to me, I like to take a moment to remember the stories he'd tell me of the amazing people he has been blessed to work with over the years. He would talk of the judge, an old Irish catholic from Boston with a presence bigger than the room. How he would talk, and everyone would listen, hanging on each syllable, even the men standing before him accused of murder or violent sex trafficking or drug running, they all stood before him enrobed in the thoughtful cadence of his voice as he doled out wisdom from his seat. He talked of things like justice, yes, every judge should, but he also talked of compassion, of thoughtfulness, of honor, of strength of character and mental fortitude. He sat on the bench as a judge, but he stood before the room as a man, a model of what one should strive to be. He loved his wife dearly for over forty years and always took the time to shake your hand, look you clearly in the eye,  address you as sir, and ask you how you were, even the young men who came before him accused of heinous acts received the same solemn dignity that I did when I came in to watch my father work on warm summer days when my daycare wasn't open. He died last year. Pancreatic cancer. He fought it till the end, but the end was bitter. I won't soon forget how my father cried for this man. All my father said to me when he got back from the funeral was, ""He was a good catholic, but a better man."" My father worked many cases that this judge presided over and they were good friends in private, he was almost a second father to my old man. My dad's real father died when I was in third grade. Alzheimer's. I had never met him. My father's side of the family lived in Texas and for some reason we had never visited. That was the first time I saw my father cry. It broke me. He spoke at the funeral, between quiet, reserved moments of thought. That was the first time I had ever truly paid attention when my dad told stories about growing up. He talked about his father's life. Making a living during the depression, fighting in the second world war, raising 11 children on a car factory worker's salary. Teaching his children the value of their faith and each other. Never letting them forget the value of a dollar or a dream. Showing the resourcefulness of an eighth-grade education and the passion of an immigrant with a belief in the ideals of America. I could tell from the way the room was packed that this man was more than just a father. That was what I thought then, but remembering my old man speaking through teary eyes before his family, I now realize the man laying in the casket before him was exactly that: a father. He was the very best thing a boy could have. A father, a giant, a pair of calloused hands tucking you into bed after they worked a 14-hour shift placing the door on new model Chryslers they could never afford. A man who smacks you across your ear when you talk to loud in church and a man who picks you back up after you fall trying to learn to ride the secondhand bike he saved up for 3 months to get you. The sort of man you spend your whole life trying to grow up into, but always feel like you're coming up just short. The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant. So, if anyone needs a 5'8"" giant, I'll be studying for my calc final and trying my best to stand tall in the library basement.

The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant. So, if anyone needs a 5'8"" giant, I'll be studying for my calc final and trying my best to stand tall in the library basement.

KTStephano,1535435469,/r/college/comments/9awdir/a_collection_of_college_epiphanies/,"Hi everyone. I wanted to go through some of some of my hard-earned lessons in college that I wish I had known going in. These were mostly gained by having a bad experience, reflecting on it, and then trying not to have that bad experience twice. I think it’s important to reflect on the important experiences we have, good or bad, and decide what to do with what they taught us. Then later on you can use that knowledge to help others too!

# Teachers can make you dumber

It’s not that you can just get bad teachers, you can get teachers that actually leave you knowing less than before. One example I had was a particular professor who explained things… wrong. If not wrong, just badly. He would either leave out details resulting in a leap of logic, or give you incorrect information.

He once spent 2 class periods lecturing over something he didn’t understand, and ultimately got wrong. The only way I know is because one of my friends emailed him to ask if he knew, and he admitted that he had messed it up. Another time he explained something I already knew and somehow confused me.

The key is to try and find every teacher on [ratemyprofessor](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) before you sign up. Worst case, if you can’t avoid the teacher, you’ll just have to teach yourself the material alongside the class to avoid falling behind people who *didn’t* have that teacher.

# Not every class is worth attending

I hate to say this one since classes are expensive, but it’s true. For one of my required credits, only one of the times worked for my schedule, so I had no choice but to keep it.

This was the class format: every day was study guide review day. She emailed the study guide for test 1 on day 1, and then went over it (and it alone) until the actual test. Upon completing test 1, she emailed the test 2 study guide…

It was better just to stay home and ready the study guide. They weren’t even that big, so you could just not do anything until a few days before.

# There are a lot of bad textbooks

For my major, there were a fair number of classes that required textbooks, but did not end up using them for their problem sets - just the material they covered. Because of this, you could just not buy them and find a better resource.

Solution? Never buy books before classes start unless you have a reason to. If you find yourself in the situation I described above, you can look around and find reviews for the book. If people say stuff like “explanations are hard to follow”, “diagrams are all blurry and hard to read”, “\*X\* book is better”, then you know what to do.

# College bookstores are expensive

I can’t tell you how many times the college campus was selling books at ripoff prices. Consider

* Buying from somewhere else
* Renting ebook version

At the very least, mark down all the college prices and search other vendors that have the same book before you buy. This way you know if they’re trying to rip you off or not.

# There are a lot of messed up weighted grading schemes

Always check and double check your syllabus to see how much things are worth. I once had a class where me and my group of friends spent enormous amounts of time on the often lengthy and very confusing homeworks. We would try to get everything to be as correct as possible only to lose points here and there anyway.

How much were they ALL worth in total? 20%. The other 80% were tests that came directly from content in his slides/lecture notes. The point was, we could have spent most of our time practicing the material in his notes, almost no time on the lengthy homeworks, and had a much easier time.

# Group projects are scary

This is especially true when you’re new in college and don’t have many friends and the professor lets you pick your group.

My first semester of college, our final project had to be done in groups. Not knowing many people, I asked two others who sat near me if they wanted to partner up.

This didn’t go well. One of them didn’t actually know any of the material and the other turned out to be a potential danger to himself and others which I found out later. I looked him up on Facebook to find that he only had 1 friend and constantly posted very suspicious things. Luckily nothing happened during the project, but I really hope he sought help.

# Group projects are awesome

The opposite is also true if you manage to find some people who have the same outlook on school as you. My last few semesters of college were spent working with people who liked to put about the same amount of effort in as I did, so all of our group work went smoothly. We got along great too, so it was constant fun. I’ll remember those as being my best moments in college no doubt.

**Lots of people are looking for new friends until the bitter end**

It was always hard talking to other people, even to ask if they wanted to form a study group. This actually got worse towards my last few semesters when I mistakenly figured that everyone already had an established group of friends for their classes.

To my surprise, there were always people in my same boat. Oftentimes going up and asking if they wanted to work together to pass the class would be met with *“YES!!!!! I mean cool, sure.”* types of answers.

So talk to your neighbor. Like, tomorrow seriously. Especially if you don’t see them talking to other people before/after class.

# Too many people rush everywhere and miss a lot

I used to be really bad at this. I’d show up right on time, if not a little late. Once class was out I was gone within 5 seconds and off to my next one, even if it was close by. When my last class ended I would take the quickest route to my car to leave.

It’s surprising how lonely this can make you. Aside from joining clubs or other organizations, simply sticking around as long as you can sometimes makes it easier to meet people. After classes are done, consider going to the dining halls to read or do homework, but try not to look closed off. You’ll run into a lot more people and campus activities this way.

# Internships are great

You don’t need to worry about having one right away, but look into them even if your program doesn’t mention them. They are a good way to gain real-world experience before you leave and they make it easier to find a job after you graduate.

One of my friends was having some trouble with his job search after graduation. Then he remembered that he had interned at one of the local companies a few years back. He called up someone he still had contact info for, they set up an interview, and he got hired really fast afterwards.

# Community colleges can help even if you’re enrolled in a larger University

The University classes were always expensive, the campus intimidating and the parking situation horrendous.

But they also had a set of pre-approved credits that could be done at the local CC and moved over. These classes were comparatively inexpensive, the application process was laid-back (some offer Guest status if you just plan on taking a couple credits), and it is often easy to get the parking figured out.

I wish I had taken more credits at a CC and transferred them.

# Your campus might be mental-health-aware

For whatever reason, I had no idea that my campus offered free counseling services for students who were having a hard time. For the first 2 years I had no idea, but then one of my friends told me he had gone to a couple sessions when he was in really bad shape mentally. They charged him nothing and he felt better.

Look into it if you haven’t.

# Talk to your professors

I really regret this. For my first couple of years, I liked to solve all my own problems with a combination of books and online resources, or even people I knew that had a better understanding than me. While this was all great, there was one thing I rarely ever did: talk to the professor. Even the ones I liked!

Well, fast forward a few years. I met some new people, and they had been much more adamant about getting to know their professors. One thing lead to another and they found themselves working with that teacher on one of their personal research ventures. Another friend even ended up being part of their professor’s startup company! They formed friendships that transcended the classroom.

There is so much more to be gained than just going to their lectures.

# Pay attention to any “food shops” on campus

So there was one particular food shop on my school’s campus that, on the outside at least, looked like a condensed version of a Market Walmart. They had pre-packaged food, drinks and microwaves.

But it had more than just food and drink. In the back they sold a host of common medications (advil, tylenol, anti-allergy), as well as other health-related products for both men and women.

Check and see if your campus has the same thing. Chances are you might not have to make a pitstop at Walgreens after all.

# Sleep is better than coffee

I used to average 2-4 hours per night and then drink coffee all day to stay awake. Sure, I got a lot of extra hours to work, but at what cost?! I felt awful every single day, and I would sleep 15 hours a day during weekends to catch up so I had very little time to do much outside of school.

The trick is to do more with less. Less hours awake, but more productive ones. The rest are spent sleeping.

[deleted],1329161373,/r/AskReddit/comments/pnue9/have_a_seat_redditors_we_need_to_talk_about_your/,"tl;dr: **Chances are you have some sort of anxiety, and it is possible to feel better.**

This is a long read, I know, but I honestly believe it might help you make positive changes in your life. I know it's something many of us can relate to all too well- anxiety. I hope you can find the time to read all of it, I assure you it will be worth it.

Reddit is an awesome website, and I've made many friends through that mutual connection of being a redditor. As everyone knows, it's a good time waster, too. So I like to think it attracts a certain type of person- or at least, it appeals to people with a few common characteristics. Hence, we have the stereotypical redditor- someone computer savvy who loves cats and shies away from social situations. Forever Alone guy, Socially Awkward Penguin, and Redditor's Wife all poke fun at this stereotype, and we upvote them because we identify with them.

There are many out there reading this that are just fine in a social situation, or are in fact popular and well-liked, but I know that just by virtue of being on the internet we're more than likely adverse to spending time with others. This is generalizing- a lot- but for the sake of the argument, let's go with this. Then we've got the common problem of ADHD- people will joke, saying they ""got distracted by their ADD, lol"" and it'll be disregarded as a joke. Not in our modern day culture of overdiagnosing could we possibly actually have that overdiagnosed disorder! Especially if it often requires treatments that are expensive or have off-putting side effects. No, absolutely not.

This is the clincher- and I've hoped I've managed to keep your attention for the moment, because I'm not just talking to those of you with ADD- but also with OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and so-on and so-forth. ""But happinesschords"", you might say, ""I don't have any of those!"" Sorry, my friend, but you're working against worse odds than you might think- there is a 12-month prevalance of 26.2% in the adult US population, and 22.3% of these cases can be severe [[source](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1ANYDIS_ADULT.shtml)], and while it's nearly impossible to get a unbiased survey of redditors on mental disorders, think for a moment. Do you get anxious every time you spend time with someone you aren't too familar with, or find yourself daydreaming of being back in your room, playing video games, in the middle of a conversation with someone else? Are you not only introverted, but anxious about it? Please, read on. If not, here's a closeup shot of my [friend's kitten and her awesome blue eyes](http://i.imgur.com/7OD8S.jpg). Enjoy.

Anxiety is something everyone deals with. The richest person in the world, with no worries or responsibilities, still gets stress and anxiety. The way that we all deal with it is different, depending of course on the person. It's logical, then, to conclude that some people deal with it better than others, and some of us can't do a very good job of it. We've all felt that pit of anxiety on a long work or school day, where it feels like everything just lined up to make your day frustrating. We play video games, read books, watch movies, hang out with friends, what have you, to deal with it. Sometimes, though, this doesn't cut it!

When stress builds up and you can't manage it, problems start to show. You may not be able to focus on work because you're too stressed about it, therefore getting more stressed. You may get moody, lashing out at friends, or responding in the extreme to minor positive or negative events. To quote the Joker (because fuck yeah Batman), ""All it takes is one bad day to drive the sanest day to lunacy.""

Now, for the really serious bit, and I want you guys to listen. The way that I see this come out- constantly!- is in social anxiety. It's almost an accepted fact that many redditors have problems socializing, but have you ever thought about why this is the case? For many of us, socializing is our weak point, and we spend so much time in our heads that we don't question our awkward interactions and just mentally move on from it. Checking the time on your phone, isolating someone you're familiar with and just talking to him, or even bringing up reddit or some other website on your phone are all coping mechanisms- we've all done it! These are our small ways of gaining control, and it keeps us from being completely driven by that anxiety.

So, why do we put up with this on a fairly regular basis? Why do we accept this as social awkwardness and just tolerate it? Sure, there are some of you out there who genuinely prefer the comfort of yourself over the comfort of others, but I think it would be fair to say most everyone doesn't want to be alone. So we find other awkward people, and great times can be had, sure. But what of everyone else? That social awkwardness infringes on a great many things that we do every day! Sure, you can be comfortable with yourself, but wouldn't it be better to be comfortable with yourself and comfortable in scary social situations?

So what am I getting at? **You can change this.** Neuroscience is a rapidly expanding fields as of late, and one of the biggest discoveries in modern science is that the brain is malleable. Chances are, you've seen the links to new research on r/science/ that have found this. **You can change your brain- for the better- and have it stay that way!** [Studies have found that the brain can still change long into adulthood- and is particularly vulnerable to change for a long time before](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v3/n1/full/nrn700.html). Furthermore, you don't have to go into see a psychiatric to make these positive changes! The things that people will commonly list as ways to improve your life- diet, excercise, and sleep, are so commonly cited because they all have direct impacts on your cognitive function. And if you stick to this long enough to acclimate your brain to this new way of life, it'll become natural for your brain to function that well.

**This isn't easy!** Not by a long shot. Real, permanent improvements in well-being come about from long term healthy living, but you can do small things to incentivize yourself to these positive changes. Some of these things include:

* Melotonin. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16295212) showed that when taken before bedtime, it helps regulate your sleep cycle to better match your body's internal clock. If you are a college student that finds yourself up long into the night, this is a natural way to help yourself get some sleep. Plus, a good night of sleep generally leads to a pretty good day.

* B Vitamins- Many of the B Vitamins have been proven to have important roles in mental function, such as [B12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18411381), and even the simple action of taking something like this is putting yourself in a good frame of mind.

* Food- If you are overweight, this may be a more obvious way to seek self improvement. If, however, you are *underweight*, you are more vulnerable to changes in mood due to blood sugar. Eating better or making sure you are getting the nutrients you need is just as important as exercise. Which brings me to my next point...

* Explore. If you're in a city, this may be easy for you. Go walking, find an interesting place to journey to, and make a nice adventure out of the trip over and back. I've set out many a weekday night and happened across stuff that I never would have otherwise, and I've met some really cool people this way. If you're in the suburbs or someplace this is hard, plan a daytrip. The simple act of planning is a good pick me up, and inviting some random friends along is a great way to get to know people.

* Drink water. This one is so often said, but it's really important- so many parts of your body make use of it in daily functions, when it goes without what it needs, you feel it. Water is good for your body (in moderation, of course) and you should try to drink water at least a few times everyday- you'd be surprised what you get away with when you don't think about drinking it!

* **Get help if you need it.** Not everyone needs a psychiatrist, but if you are going through a particularly tough time and need some help, don't be afraid to see someone. There are more cost effective options out there than you would think, and if you don't want to go on medication, you don't have to. Remember, the psychiatrist is there to work *with* you to make you better, and you don't have to do anything he says if it's not okay with you. And please know that it doesn't make you crazy to seek help- and labeling yourself as such will only make you think more negatively. There are some things out there that you just can't push down on your own, and if you ever think you might not be able to handle it all- remember- please!- *seek help*!

Anxiety is a positive feedback loop of negative thinking. You ruminate and postulate and get stuck thinking about the most innane bullshit sometimes. Breaking the cycle is just as simple as wanting to break out of it and taking the actions necessary to do so. You may never be able to completely get rid of it- stress and anxiety are a natural part of life- but no one should have to deal with a much higher baseline of stress than is normal. When you spend most of your time in your head, if you can be even the slightest bit happier, you can absolutely change the mindset for the rest of your life.

I’ll try to put this in a logical order but I apologize if I end up rambling a bit.

I’m a couple years out of school and am making ends meet. I don’t have a lot of money and I have a lot of debt, but I still lead a good life. Work is challenging, but only occasionally stressful, and I have a very good group of friends that are always there for me no matter what. However, I think I’m reaching a breaking point with my family. 

A little background – my parents have struggled with money for years. My dad works in an industry where it has been incredibly difficult for him to keep a job. I'm almost positive it’s nothing to do with his job performance based on various things over the years. I just think his industry (health care) has been incredibly tough. They were able to help me pay some for college but I still had to take out quite a bit in student loans. During that time (I also worked a lot through college), I gave my parents a lot of money (thousands) – from my savings (dried up years ago), what I earned working in college, and from my student loans. I had worked a lot in high school before things went south for the family. I saved up and bought a car junior year and still had a good amount of savings when I graduated. I feel it important to point out that it doesn’t bother me I gave them money. My family needed help and I did it without thinking twice. I’m not saying it wasn’t hard for me but I never really had to think about doing it. All of our accounts were linked though our bank for years. It’s been that way my whole life (meaning since this was an available service) and that was how my parents gave us our allowance. It later turned into how I would give my parents money and my account was often drained to pay overdraft fees of others (after this starting happening I opened a new account at a separate bank and closed this one shortly after I started my new job). 

After college I took a job in a new city and am now far away from my family. Over the past few years I’ve been giving my brother money (also to the tune of thousands) not including co-signing student loans. I know some may comment that this wasn’t a smart financial decision but like I said before this is my family. I’ve made financial mistakes in the past and am still paying for those – but I’ve also learned a lot from them and am much smarter with my money and spending habits. He hasn’t had the same support system I had (although I paid/am paying for a lot of my school still) and my parents are no longer able to help him. 

But now I feel I need to make a tough decision – I need to cut them off – financially. It’s gotten to the point that every time I get a call from a family member (more below) I immediately stress out and that stress and anger linger for hours and sometimes for days after the call (partially because I wish it wasn’t this was but since it is this way I wish I could do more). This has been getting worse over the years too. **THIS** is the most stressful thing in my life by far. Nothing is even close. I’m incurring even more debt to help him, some of which includes his expensive medical bills. I told him yesterday that I couldn’t afford to help him (this time) but he still called me late last night desperately asking for money. Frankly, I can’t do this anymore. I feel bad saying no but I don’t think I have any other option at this point. At some point I need to be able to live my life and work my way out of this financial hole.

This is a side topic although relevant: for about the first two years out of college every time I received a call from my parents I expected the worst – that my sister had died. She’s a recovering drug addict. She is doing extremely well now but for years she was in bad shape. And until about a year ago I was scared to death every time my parents called. A lot of times it was just to say hello but many times it was to tell me she was missing or had overdosed. My parents incurred an enormous amount of debt for this. I know this is slightly off the financial topic but I also wanted to add more background and help you understand why I dread phone calls from my family.

To the next part – my parents are losing their house. They need to find a new place but no one seems to be talking about it. My grandparents have offered to let them move in (to a new city far away) and I think this is the only viable option while they try to get back on their feet. They also have several dogs that will not be able to go with them if they move to my grandparent’s house and will likely have to go even if they are able to find a place local. It will be difficult to find them a home because most of them are rescue dogs and still don’t do well with people outside the family. But no one is talking about what they need to do. Every time the subject comes up (this is all secondhand) my mom breaks down or someone delays the conversation and there is never a discussion. 

I think I need to take the following actions or some variation but I could really use feedback. Is it too harsh? Am I going about this the wrong way? I don’t want to call anybody out and I don’t want to point fingers but I don’t think they realize the toll that this has taken on me and I think they need to understand this, where I’m coming from, and that they need to figure out what needs to be done.

**First**, I need to fly home and facilitate a discussion. This needs to happen soon. Not only for my sake but for my family’s sake. I can’t keep living like this. I’ll make sure to point out that I have no regrets. I have no hard feelings. It is going to be a tough conversation but it needs to happen and I need them all to commit to being a part of this and not walking away. We need to figure this out as a family.
 
**Second**, I need to make clear is that I can no longer financially support them. I’ve incurred thousands in debt from this. It is a huge financial strain and it is also taking a heavy physical and emotional toll as well. I don’t want to stress out every time I receive a call from a family member and I need to make it clear I cannot and will not do this anymore. No ifs, ands, or buts. I want to be able to talk to them like we used to do. I want to be there to support them. But I want this to be as a brother and a son – not as a financial lifeline.

**Third**, My brother needs to move back in with my parents. There has always been conflict between them while they lived together but if he has to call me for money all the time then he shouldn’t be living anywhere but home – especially while he’s in school. Rent is not cheap and I think it was a bad decision for him to move in with his girlfriend (he pays for EVERYTHING – but that’s another discussion and I’ve already had a discussion with him about this).
   
**Fourth**, We need to decide as a family (mostly them but I feel I need to be the bad guy and start the discussion) what the next steps are after they are forced to vacate the house. This includes discussion of the dogs, whether they will move to a different city to live with the grandparent’s and who will go with them. I realize this is a key decision as it determines if my brother is able to move back in with them. If they leave and he stays to finish school he will still have to find a place to live. I just don’t think it should be with his girlfriend.

**Finally**, My mom needs to find a job as well - a real job. While I was in high school she started teaching ballet to children and she loves doing it but it provides almost no money. That was fine for a while but it's to the point where my dad cannot be the sole provider for this family. He is having a hard time finding work and they need to work though this together. 

So that’s what I’ve been thinking about all morning and what I think needs to be done. I could use some feedback. I feel bad that I have to do this but I think I need to do it for my own sake. I could really use some feedback and/or advice on the situation. Have any of you had to deal with these types of issues before? What did you do about it? How did it go? Would you have done something differently?

To preface, I was a high performer in high school (Class of 2020). By no means was I a particularly good student, but I was a high performer, and I've read tons and tons at this point on the issues that are associated with that/being labeled ""gifted""/etc. I never really had to apply a ton of study skills in high school therefore and never really had the chance to learn them. I was both smart and decently privileged, so anywhere that my smarts couldn't make up for the study skills, a tutor or my mom was there to catch me. I pretty much nailed high school with the exception of like one B in Senior year after COVID hit. Graduated with honors, wasn't valedictorian but that was fine, the kid who got it really deserved it.

In the summer leading up to college, I got accepted to my dream school, which was awesome, but a lot of family issues resulted from it. Toxic father who was abusive as both a parent and a spouse who insisted to pay for college for the sake of status, but also refused to pay for any school unless I landed ridiculous amounts of scholarship money... you know how it goes. Eventually we managed to get him to pay for my dream school, since I didn't get in on any scholarship and our blessed situation financially didn't really award any financial aid. I promise this becomes important later, just stick with me here.

Of course, because this was the summer of 2020, this is when COVID really changed the college scene and my school offered the option to go online, so naturally this is what I did since my whole family was really COVID-conscious. Fall semester comes around... and given how I started this, you're probably expecting me to say this is where I flopped, but truthfully, I actually NAILED first year. I even managed to develop all the work ethic and good study habits, along with having a thriving social life while at home! All As in primarily important pre-med stem classes with an extra elective I wanted to take. Only got an A- in the lab Gen Chem lab. I had the option to take Spring semester remote as well, so I did that.

At this point, a huge family crisis hit where we finally just hit the peak of the bs my father was putting my mother, sister, and I through, and he filed for a divorce behind my mom's back after she suggested they could file together. This became an incredibly stressful situation on top of being ostracized from an online friend group I'd been in for a year and a breakup with my girlfriend of three year at the time. My coping mechanisms weren't the greatest, but I trudged through the semester and did alright. Somewhat lighter course load, in all fairness, but all As and A-s, with one B+ from Gen Chem (which would have been an A if I didn't botch the final), so that's still incredible performance. In all fairness, I also made a lot of excuses in my lighter, less-serious classes that allowed me extensions on certain assignments and such, but that's still incredible performance and I'm not afraid to flaunt that. Ended freshman year on a 3.8/9 (depending on how you round it) GPA. However, due to the panic at the time, my mom really was panicked about that B+ in Gen Chem, so we decided it would be a good idea to get Organic out of the way ASAP, so I took it during the summer.

That was hell, but I came out with a B-, but my mom and I, being so used to how I was performing in high school, felt it wouldn't be a bad idea to just take it again during the school year since I've already seen the material once now and can just nail it next time, while also taking Bio and some other lighter classes (that would fit my now major, Psychology). It also was a huge hit to my confidence and momentum, alongside what I perceived to now be another huge pressure I needed to compensate for when I got to school in the Fall.

**Here's the juicy part. Sophomore year**

The divorce situation between my parents boiled on for the entirety of that winter semester, through the summer and fall semester, and finally ended during the Spring break of this past Spring 2022 semester. It only became worse and worse, and with my moving out, I wasn't able to handle it well at all, especially since on the big move-out day (remember I was remote that entire first year), my father trounced all over it by calling in his moving crew to move out to his apartment the same day.

My coping mechanisms with the whole ordeal were awful, and I had also recently rekindled my relationship with the girl who broke up with me during Spring 2021 (we found out a lot of our issues were based on gaslit misunderstandings from some 'friends' we had who hated what we had going on... we're healthier and happier than ever with each other now). So I was spending a lot of time with her over the phone trying to cope. At first, things still felt exciting and fresh and new. I renovated my room from the worst building on campus into something *AMAZING* (not to brag). My first couple weeks I was studying hard and good, but it all just started to catch up with me.

My work ethic just vanished. All that change I'd made and resilience I had to the family situation and other problems in freshman year just vanished. I was breaking down, I was skipping classes (which I had never done even *once* up until this point), and was doing so pretty unapologetically. I was suddenly having intense trouble grasping material well enough to do anything on exams, even when I felt just as confident as I would in freshman year before exams that I *aced*. I tried talking to on-campus counselors and therapists and they were nice but it just wasn't helping. I took courses from the Student Wellness Center to see what I might be missing, but I just couldn't do it.

I knew and know what I have to do but I just can't do it. I know I need to put in the work, but I've stopped studying diligently and regularly too. That whole first semester I didn't really even have close friends on campus aside from my roommate, because I became a shut-in, but in the last two weeks of Fall 2021 I managed to find some really nice people who I'm now close friends with. I even start making the walk to classes, then just sitting outside the classroom or building. It's right there. It's just another 50 footsteps away, but I don't go in. My confidence kept taking more and more hits as I'd mess up even incredibly easy classes. Fall 2021 ended with one A in a basically gimme-A class, a B-, and all Cs.

It's only during Spring 2022 when I managed to fix my issues of attendance and start actually getting up in the mornings consistently and going to classes and not just staying outside, and even now, my grades are technically doing even worse. I ended up with a midterm deficiency for my absences in one of my classes. I used standing witness in my parents' trial to skip out on some midterms whose credit have been shifted onto my upcoming finals. I don't want to be a bad student or a bad person but I really just feel like I somehow randomly am now. I really want to do well. I just can't find the drive, focus, or motivation to do any of what I need to do now. My semester is yet again looking like it's going to finish out on Bs and Cs, which, while not the worst thing ever, is certainly not gonna cut it for med schools.

I've made it this far, and even got myself together during my freshman year of college. I managed to overcome that typical gifted-kid burnout slump or whatever it is. I overcame my lack of study skills, time, management, and social awkwardness I had in high school. Then I move out to college after doing the first year remote with a few unnecessary hits to my self-confidence over things that really weren't big problems in hindsight, a bunch of extra problems on my back, and no ways to properly cope that are genuinely helping me.

*The interesting part of the issue here is not the same thing about high-performing high school students doing bad in college*. *It's about actually getting myself together after high school, nailing freshman year and not even feeling too burnt out, making one mistake (that I blew way out of proportion) at a bad time when everything else in my life comes crashing down, and now it's all gone.*

I keep feeling remotivated to try and try again but then two days after I get that motivation burst I just fall back into it all. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I can't find anything on even remotely similar situations, but there has to be someone out there, right? Please. Someone help me. I'm so tired and scared. I'm not gonna make any huge life-altering or ending decisions so please don't worry about that. But just, please. Someone help me. I don't know what to do.

Zaephyr,1329183990,/r/AskReddit/comments/poe38/roommate_cost_me_10000_and_i_need_help/,"
Hey there fellow Redditors.  I've been lurking for a bit and throwing an occasional comment for a bit now, but I've decided to come to you for some (preliminary) legal help.


I currently live in a town called Coeur d'Alene, ID.  Lived here before the incident I'm about to describe and moved back right around the end of the below thread.


A couple things to get out of the way that may help explain some of what happened.  The person involved had been a friend of 10 years before this incident and I do still talk to her semi-regularly today (maybe once a week or so).  Also, I'm a sissy for confrontation – especially back then.  I'm at the point where I know action needs to be taken so I'm preparing myself for the fallout that will probably come.


With that out of the way, on to the story:


I lived in Missoula, MT for about a year and half.  It was a rather random decision that's not important but it the end I ended up in a two bedroom apartment on the west end of town.  They were considered ""luxury"" apartments, but I use the quotes for reason.  They were expensive apartments, but within my budget while I had a roommate.  They cost $856 a month and that included heater, AC, water, cable and cable internet.  The only other bill for the apartment itself was electricity which cost ~$40 per month on the budget plan they had.  That meant our bills were about $450 a month for the apartment and whatever our cell phone bill cost and necessities like food.  Our cell phone bill with Verizon Wireless cost about $150-75 per month because we had two smartphones on the plan with the unlimited data plans and an unlimited texting plan.  It was painful but manageable.  I worked for Staples as their Master Tech so I made a whopping $9.05 an hour.  It did let me bring home close to $1200 a month though so I was able to pay for everything I had to.


She worked for DirectTV which was nice because it was right next to the apartment – she could walk to work.  It was a call center that paid decently (I think an average of ~$11-12).  The first month or so was fine.  I worked 40 hours a week so I wasn’t home much during the day to see when she went to work and she spent most of her time in her room anyways so I would see her at night usually and that was about it.


About two months in however after paying my half of the rent I get a notice saying that half the rent is still due and that if I don’t pay by the next day the late fees will hit.  She wasn’t home at the time so I made sure I got it paid so we didn’t get hit with fees and would just as her when she got home.  When I talked to her she mentioned that she had been let go because she had strep during one of their training sessions (I guess their training sessions are like 5-6 weeks long at times) and that attendance was mandatory at those sessions.  I thought it was a bogus reason to let somebody go but I didn’t worry about it too much because she mentioned that she was already applying for different jobs and had her resume printed off and ready to go.  She would borrow my car occasionally because she didn’t have one to drop these resumes off.

She apparently found some jobs working for like Ross, Aeropostale, Old Navy, etc. but would only work there for a couple days before deciding she’d work for one of the other companies that hired her (I’m fuzzy on these details partly because I was being lied to, I’m sure and partly because this was more than two years ago and I just have a bad memory).  When it came time to pay rent for the third month we ran into the same issue as the second month except this time she was able to run down to the office and get them paid.  After the third month she never paid another day of rent.  I’ll get back to this in a moment.


Next was the cell phone bill.  Having at least the phone service was really important to me.  I had just moved out of mom’s house for the first time and was in a new city so the one thing I enjoyed doing was calling my mom, my brother-in-law and my newborn niece most nights to talk.  For the first few months everything was great – I would pay for half and have her call and pay the other half.  It turned out when I thought she was paying for her portion of the phone bill she was in fact passing bad checks for the amount due.  After a little bit I found out about this because I saw on my Verizon statement that I had a chargeback and a fee for a NSF check being sent.  At that time she told me that she ran into issues paying that month but was now able to pay it and the next month’s portion – and she was able to.   However two months later or so the same thing happened.  I was furious and once again she said she would take care of that past amount plus the upcoming amount.  I told her that I was going to leave this account once she paid that and move to my dad's wireless account because it would save me money and I wouldn't have to deal with the issues. 


About 6 months into our year lease on the apartment she said she was going to move back to Coeur d’Alene, look for work there and then send me money.  I wasn’t very hopeful at the prospect but I couldn’t control what she did and didn’t see much use to.  She wasn’t paying any of the bills in Missoula.  At this point I had left my job at Staples because I was offered a web programming position at the University of Montana where I went to school.  The pay was a couple cents less an hour but was right on campus as was definitely closer to what I wanted to do in life so I took it.  I only worked 22 hours per week because of how the schedule worked (couldn’t work weekends and we closed by 6 during the weekdays).  This was alright though because it at least gave me two solid days of homework time on the weekend which I needed with my course-load that year.


I wasn’t making $1200 a month anymore though.  Making the $900 a month payment was near-impossible.  I called in every last favor with my family in order to not be evicted.  I would routinely eat one package of top ramen every other day and survive on water/juice the rest of the time.  I had a place to stay though that was warm at night though and that’s what mattered.  I would occasionally drive back to Coeur d’Alene or to my grandparents place in Montana for the weekend and bring back food with me that last me for a little bit.  I’m not trying to talk about how bad my life was or anything, because it wasn’t, I’m just trying to emphasize how little money I had.


I tried finding roommates but in a college town in the middle of the semester it’s tough.  Finally in March my lease ran out and I was able to move out.  I decided though that I was moving back to Coeur d’Alene as soon as the semester was done so I stayed in my apartment for the last two months paying the non-discounted rate of $1030 a month instead of $856.


So here I am, about a year after this.  My friend has insisted she’ll pay me but she’s just as flaky about jobs now as she was then.  My question is what are my options?  What is she responsible for?  Am I screwed?  Our names were on the lease of the apartment.  My name was on the electric bill.  The cell phone bill I’m unsure about.  I took my name off when I moved to my dad’s account but apparently even though she assumed liability of the account, my name was still on it because when she didn’t pay the $1100 bill the collection notice came to me and I’m trying to deal with that as well.


What is she responsible for?  Can I sue?  I have a MPN that I’m going to send certified to her to have her sign agreeing to the charges I think.  The entire bill of what she owes me comes to just under $10,000.  It’s too much for small claims court I believe (I think it’s a $5,000 limit) so should I have her sign one MPN for the rent and one for everything else and try to take her to court on two different items?  I live in Idaho like I said and going out to talk to an attorney in Montana is difficult because of class and work here so I was hoping to get a little bit of direction before I find a lawyer in Montana (should I need to get one).


I'm resigned to the fact that I'll probably have to pay off this cell phone debt, and I will (although it may be slowly) and I'm going to try and sue her for what she owes me but I'm just trying to get information on how this whole process works.


Thank you very much for taking the time to help me out.

CJ64Bit,1547829524,/r/college/comments/ahc9s4/some_advice_from_a_senior/,"Hey guys I made a post a few days ago with some advice as an RA pertaining to living in dorms mostly, this is just some things I’ve learned over my years at college, hopefully it helps 


- It’s okay to not know what major you want to be

Don’t decide on a major if you’re iffy about it. Give yourself time to think, you have probably a year’s worth of prereqs to blow through before you likely need to decide for sure. High school places a lot of emphasis on knowing what you want to do but the truth is: there’s a sizable amount of people who go into college not knowing, even people who have declared a major may not know. If you’re hesitant to get started on something, switch your major to undeclared until you’re ready.

- Switch majors if you’re unhappy 

Don’t keep paying for something you don’t want to do. Even if it sets you back, that’s better than being stuck with a degree you don’t want to pursue and regretting it later on. The conversation may be hard to have with your parents or your partner or whomever but in the end you’re there to find your success and your happiness, not to wind up somewhere you don’t want to be.

- Take advantage of student services 

Your tuition is covering a lot of services you may not know about but are free to you to use. Many campus have an on staff therapist or two if you need to sit down and talk with someone. Even more campuses have a health center that will provide you with basic medical supplies and medicine; some even give free STD screenings and shots. It’s likely every single college has a gym of some sort where you can go to run, lift, or use the courts to play basketball or other games. There’s a lot you campus has to offer, use it while you can before you’re out of there and are have to pay for it out of pocket.

- C’s get degrees but don’t expect a reference

If you’re aiming to just get your Bachelor’s or Associate’s degree then getting C’s are fine. You’re overall GPA does matter depending on what field you’re going into, and especially if you plan on continuing to graduate school, but in the end getting straight Cs is not as detrimental as it was in high school. THAT SAID, don’t expect a reference from any of your professors if you’re putting in the bare minimal effort just to pass.

- Don’t EVER buy a textbook until the first day of class unless told to do so ahead of time   

Plain and simple, text books are a fucking scam. They’re overpriced when brand new and some classes force online portions just to ensure you can’t get it rented or used. Don’t spend the money unless you have 100% confirmation you have to, and even then if you don’t need a brand new text, use Chegg.com to save you loads. Even then, some classes will claim to need a textbook but wind up never using it so ask around to see if you truly do actually “need” it. 

- Hang out anywhere else but your dorm room

I know it can be intimidating when you’re in a new place but it’s not healthy to be hold up in your room during all of your free time. Most dorms have a lobby of some sort, so if you want to read a book or play a game on your handheld, go do it in the lobby; it’ll get you out of your room and maybe even meeting new people. People who stay shut in their dorms tend to be more lonely and even depressed. 

- Make sure you know each of your professor’s attendance policy 

Each professor is different with varying levels of how strict they can be. If you can only miss three days, you better be sure you count how many you have left before they start docking you points. If they are incredibly lax about it, don’t abuse it because you’re only going to hurt yourself 

- Just get up to use the bathroom if you need

Don’t make a big deal about it. Don’t try to draw attention to yourself. Just get up and leave and no one will care. Professors cannot forbid you from leaving under any circumstance and if they try to then you can challenge that with the dean. You’re an adult, you do what you need to do. 

- Be nice to your professors

This should go without saying but remember they at people too and deserve your respect. Not only are they taking time from their life to help you further your education but they are also a valuable resource. Many professors have some sort of credibility and can be a great reference down the line if you’ve put in the work and haven’t tainted your name. 

- Don’t join a frat or sorority until your second semester at the earliest 

College takes time to get used to. It’s a different lifestyle with a different type of workload and you will need time to adjust. As fun as frats and sororities may seem, they’re also going to ask to take a good chunk of your free time that you may need. At that, depending on what sort they are, if you’re going to get into the party lifestyle with these organizations, at least know you can handle your work and school life first. I’ve seen so many students join a frat or sorority their first semester only to get completely burnt out because they weren’t able to handle balancing both of these completely new lives. 

- Don’t abuse your newfound freedom

For many freshman this is your first time away from home, and while freedom is nice you do need to realize that it can easily be taken away as well. Yes, you’re going to want to party and stay up incredibly late and try a ton of new things you never got to do but realize that you’re paying a lot of money to get an education first and all these other things second. If you don’t take care of yourself or your educational duties first, you can easily find yourself right back at home with your parents should you screw up too bad. Realize that this is a privilege you have, and while you are an adult and you’re now making your own decisions, you still have to abide by the rules of the school. Be responsible.

- There’s so much free stuff! Take it!

Health services provides condoms. IT usually provides Ethernet cables for the dorm. Various offices likely have free pens and notebooks if you need them. 

- Assigned seats aren’t a thing but they sort of are

After the first week everyone tends to settle into a pattern. If the class is small enough there’s no harm in switching seats but just keep in mind if it’s already taken. Its not a major issue but most people resort to sitting in the same spot just out of habit. 

- Take a semester off if you need to, or withdraw if college isn’t for you

College is fucking expensive and your personal health and well-being comes first. If you need a break, the campus isn’t going anywhere and you can always come back. College is not for everyone, and though I will always promote furthering your education and bettering yourself in that regard. The truth is that the college environment isn’t for everyone and depending on what you want to do, you may not even need it. Don’t put yourself in debt for an experience you’re unsure of or don’t need. So many people are pushed into college before knowing what they want to do, don’t rack up the debt if you’re unsure of what path you want to take. It’s better to wait and be sure on where you want to go rather than get halfway through and realize you’re not following your passion; you’ll be wasting your time and be in debt you could have avoided. It’s okay to not know. It’s okay to take your time. It’s okay if college isn’t the route you want to take. 

- Don’t take a semester of all online classes ever if you live in dorms and/or don’t work

I’ve had a few friends think this is a good idea and found themselves bored out of their minds. Online classes tend to be self paced and you can get most of it done a lot quicker than you would otherwise. While free time sounds great, if you don’t have anything to fill that time then the semester is going to drag on. If you think you’re going to spend that time with friends, remember they all have classes too and are going to likely be busy when you’re free. 

- Sleep is important

For the love of god get some sleep. I only just learned how to have an actual okay sleep schedule and I’m finding myself being so much more productive than I ever was. There will be nights where you’re up until 3am writing papers or doing research but for the days you’re not, please get some sleep. Take melatonin if you need, it’s a life saver. You will be amazed at how much better your life will be when you’re not heading to bed at 3am and needing to be up at 7 or 8am. 

- You don’t need a ton of supplies

Every freshman makes the mistake of overbuying supplies and in reality you’ll only need a few notebooks, some pens and pencils, and whatever specific material is needed for a class. Save your money, don’t go overboard. Buy supplies as you need them, don’t preemptively purchase a ton of things you’ll never use.

[deleted],1339179823,/r/AskReddit/comments/urxi9/how_in_the_world_do_i_fix_my_current_social_an/,"Dear Reddit, 

I’m trying to figure out where I went wrong and concrete solutions to my perceived problems. 

********************************
Start TL/DR;
********************************

My current situation is as follows:

•	20 going on 21 years old

•	Zero living friends (will elaborate later in this post)

•	Dead end job that barely makes ends meet.

•	Occasionally do questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.
 
•	Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 

•	Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating. 

********************************
End TL/DR;
********************************


To be frank, I’m fucking distressed. To put things into perspective, I’ve been homeless as a minor and lost my mother when I was 7 and still never felt this bad before.  My view on the list above is as follows: 


Problem A) Zero living friends. 


Most of my friends were in Seattle, WA. The short version is that most of them overdosed on drugs of their choice or combinations of them. It still doesn’t change how I felt about them or still feel about them. They were all I had in the world that I knew I could depend on. These aren’t the friends that are only there on Facebook and whatnot, these were people that stuck their necks out for me. Since I started college I haven’t been able to make a single friend or contact. My existence is one of barely making enough money to continue, school  and having just enough sleep to avoid getting into a horrible car crash. 


Solution A) Find Friends.


Much easier said than done. I learned quite a few things about the character of people from living in austere conditions, but it turns out that most people are just as shallow as I remembered. The ones who aren’t still give me the same funny looks, so I eventually adopted an “I don’t give a fuck” policy and simply spoke what came to my mind. A prime example of this would be what we call “The Porch Kids”. There was a smoker’s porch at my old university and it had some interesting characters on it. I was homeless at the time (2nd time around, longer story involving a backstab and failed attempt to get me and my significant other to Florida). All of them cracked homeless jokes. Some even started rumors about me being homeless. I was asked if I was homeless. When I told them the truth, none offered to help. They bugged out, actually. Once I was on my feet again, I found that most of them have called for various favors, but out of 8 or so, only one has treated me decently, and I actually view him as a role model even though I haven’t heard from him in a month. Most people also don’t believe I’m 20 and that presents a barrier when trying to make friends and network. Either way, I used to approach situations neutrally, got treated like shit, decided to not follow social protocol, still get treated like shit so I opt for not following protocol because it is easier. 


Problem B) Dead End Job that barely makes ends meet.


I started at FedEx Ground where I used to live and moved up from a package handler to QA then to a management. The city I used to live in was so expensive even as a full time manager, I still got by on the skin of my teeth expense wise.  I had to bump down to a package handler again for the transfer to the city I’m in now. The positive is that I can barely get by on 15 hours of work a week due to the extremely low cost of living. The downside is that my work environment is terrible. It’s a lot worse than when I was a new hire in my old city. To get an idea, you have 6 guys including myself at this facility. I bust ass and am responsible for not just one door, but all 4 doors while we have one guy splitting (not as difficult as loading trailers but still hard) 3 guys unloaded vans and trailers (cake compared to loading one) and we have another guy that literally sits and does nothing. The QA does nothing either. The Manager is the same as QA. I find myself doing the shittiest and most difficult jobs in the shortest amount of time then doing the QA’s and manager’s job. To rub it in, when I’m pulling for the QA’s and manager’s slack; I then get told I need to increase my load rate. When I point out that one guy can only do so much (my average load a night is 3600-4000 packages, all industrial shippers greater than 75lbs a box) they tell me to only do my job. When I only do my job, then I get told to do QA and the Manager’s job. Tonight I went into their office to get a battery for a STAR III scanner and both of them were watching YouTube videos. I really hate my current work environment. It’s not the job, but the environment. 


Solution B) Find a Better Job. 


This is proving to be very difficult. I can’t find anyone that is actively hiring right now other than guys who are in the good old boys network. I’m still hitting the beat and will do my best to get out of there before December. 


Problem C) occasionally does questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.


I’m not going to go into what I do specifically other than I’m nothing more than a logistics guy. I don’t steal or sell anything. I have to do this sometimes to make sure I can pay tuition and other expenses if they get too far out of hand. I’m pretty sure I’ve lost part of myself or the ability to feel as much as I used to. I grew even more acute eyes in the back of my head and find myself checking the rear view mirror constantly, or if there’s a knock on my door, covering the peep while I stand off to the side. I also became even better in the woods and better at driving on a variety of surfaces ranging from tarmac to gravel. 


Solution C) Join the Army Reserve or Something.

 
I figure if I’m already damned good at evading trained personnel, have a little over half of a chemical engineering education, a wide variety of job experience ranging from customer service to welding, can move through the woods like a ghost, and get to elevated positions like roof tops that are inaccessible, I might as well make myself legitimate and serve my country. It would also get rid of my college money problems. I just can’t find a recruiter that doesn’t seem hell bent on fucking me over in any branch. 


Problem D) Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 


It’s just a depressing environment. I go on a 2 mile run every night after work and it is painful to look at my surroundings. I try to zone out and not think, but I loop back to what problems I’m trying to solve, and many times I leave home with fewer problems than what I come back with. It’s a fucking self-destructive cycle. 


Solution D) Finish My Engineering Degree and get the fuck out. 


This is the only solution that doesn’t present more problems. It’s actually the only constant I have right now. 


Problem E) Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating
Since day one, I have been fucked by financial aid. I have presented proof that I was homeless and independent as a minor in addition to paper work going farther back that I was in and out of state custody for a 6 year stint. It simply was an aide counselor not wanting to work with me and both institutions. I even wrote my senator about the issue and I got what appeared to be a generic response instructing me to fill out the FASFA. To rub it in, grad school and internships are a dead dream with my 2.2 GPA. People don’t understand that 8-10 hours a day working and full time school makes a C+ seem like an A+. With the fewer hours at work, I can focus more on school.


Solution E) 


See Problem C. It’s nothing near ideal and it creates the same fucking self-destructive loop. 
See Solution C. I just need to find a recruiter that’s willing to not fuck me over. Last one tried to tell me 88 mike was the same thing as forward observer. Airforce recruiter is so full of it his eyes are brown. 

The disturbing part is that I find myself wanting to die.  I’d rather have nothing than any of this. I mean what the hell am I loosing that is positive? I can’t even enjoy sex anymore the rare time I find a fuckbuddy. The feelings of distress and despair get worse when I start looking around myself. The average  20 year old college student appears to be happy. They have friends. They have a family. If they have to work they typically have high paying internships or a good part-time job that has little bullshit in it. They have great grades, and often don’t have to worry about making ends meet. It seems so alien to me. Almost like I’m an interloper and do not belong in what surrounds me. 


I’m looking for viable solutions that can help me achieve my goals- Not pitty. I’m going to be a Chemical Engineer one day. Please help me to do this. Anything. I’m tired of this and want it to be over

ambitiouslearner123,1587235512,/r/college/comments/g3sngn/need_some_perspective_on_this_one_professor_who/,"Let me preface by saying this: I used to think that when little kids get bad grades and then they blame their teacher by saying things like ""he/she doesn't like me"", I think no. We need to look at the bigger picture here. There are cases where the student didn't study enough and got bad grades and now the student refuses to except responsibility so the student blames everyone else.

However, there are also cases where the student is correct in assessing that the teacher genuinely does not like the student and purposefully gives bad grades. This scenario requires proof. Also the student needs to mentally reflect why the teacher does not like him, what events lead to this, and what he can do in the future, and/or how to build better relationships with people.

This is a story about Professor Aly (not real name). Professor Aly got a biology lecturer position at a top tier uni in the USA. She can't make tenure position yet because she is still studying for PhD at uni ABC. She also does not have speculator research, high research index, or enormous funding from the NIH/NSF/DoD or whatever government agency. Usually all these things are looked at whenever the dean selects a professor to be on the tenure track. Also, masters and PhD candidates can be adjuncts and supplement their own tuition by teaching intro-undergrad classes. Or they can be TAs at intro to upper level classes. This is normal.

Over the years, Professor Aly has shown her true colors of being a sham, a con, and overall nut job. While she was a PhD candidate at Uni ABC, along the way she must have left or been fired from her lab because the PI removed her from the lab's official website. \[More details below\].

Her PhD is something along the lines of computational neuroscience. It sounds fancy and hard. It is. I don't doubt or look down at some people who either fail out of a tough PhD or they leave because they are no longer interested in academia. *I don't judge. STEM PhD is hard.*

However, what is odd by me is the sheer number of unrelated classes taught by Professor Aly. I said I was fine with her teaching introduction to bio since that is a very basic class. I myself had 2 years of biology before entering college so introduction to bio was a breeze. Since she was a Computational Neuroscience PhD, she also taught a Computational Neuroscience class.

But Professor Aly was teaching other classes such as Genetics, Biostatistics, Molecular and Cell Biology, Advanced Molecular and Cell Biology, and Nutrition. None of those classes seem related to her field of study, and in class she demonstrated that she had no level of mastery. She would make a lot of mistakes. She would also teach outdated information especially in the field of Molecular and Cell Biology. Even in the advanced fields which were approaching graduate level work and recent research papers, Professor Aly showed that she did not have the slightest clue what was going on in the field, in research, or what the paper was about.

**She would even read a retracted paper and not know what retracted was, and that the information was garbage**.

Her teaching style was poorly executed too. She often spoke too fast. Even when students tried to ask her to slow down, she refused. She wanted to get out of class 30 minutes early every day because it was clear she did not know the material enough to teach. Eventually she stopped trying to read and summarize research papers for us. **She moved onto reading the Huffington post, and other popsci content**. She approached psuedoscience territory by promoting vitamins as cures for cancer and diabetes.

Only in 2 classes did she grade the material. As the University policy dictated that most midterms and finals needed to be short answers and long answers to prove knowledge: *having exams be written left the door open to subjectivity and interpretation.*

If exams were all multiple choice, then it's either right or wrong. Either you selected the correct bubble or not. This also leaves the students grade to chance or luck as random circles can determine your fate.

Anyway Professor Aly abused that written exam policy to her advantage. If she didn't like a student, she would give students straight C's and B-'s, which are straight killers especially for Biology majors who are Pre-meds and want a 3.8 GPA (or A- in all of undergrad classes) to apply to medical school).

If you tried to politely ask why you got a bad grade, **she would say the answer is wrong. When you show her Google or the textbook, she would say your answer wasn't detailed enough**.

***\^That is how she abused the written exam policy.***

But students that she did like: their exams could be filled with garbage or the wrong answers and they would still get full credit. Students have pushed pseudoscience and homeopathy on genetics exams and still got credit. Or students wrote completely wrong information, as debunked by Google and fact checked by established and qualified biology PhD professors.

Professor Aly only graded 2 classes herself. The other classes, she allowed an undergrad TA grade everything. Since the TA was an undergraduate student, and the same age as the rest of the class, you can already see the shear favoritism and corruption in this grading. Also many of the TAs were not qualified to grade. Yes MANY TAs. I have had *TAs who were finance engineers* who took only 2 biology classes and they were grading exams. There is also the potential FERPA violations of letting your peers see your entire exam and homework and university login credentials.

One TA even accidentally leaked everyone's grades on Snapchat. This actually happened.

Behind the backdoors of the TAs, they talked about how much they hated Professor Aly because they got abused, she blackmailed them, **she made them do stupid things like count ketchup packets in the cafeteria and write a report about it.**

She and another biology professor were eventually caught because they stole money and used that money to pay their TAs in University XYZ. Yes, she stole money from this uni to pay for her TAs in another uni.

Many wanted to report Professor Aly but they knew they couldn't because they would jeopardize themselves. In addition to teaching core classes required to graduate, and thus your fate was sealed by her discretion,

Professor Aly was also an advisor and a pre-health committee member. So in order to get a biology degree, you needed to kiss her ass for 4 years straight. If you wanted to go to medical or dental school, you need a health committee member's letter. She has denied this letter to at least 10 students who all left crying and confused as they were ineligible to apply. Some had decent GPA of 3.5 \[not super competitive, but semi-competitive\] yet she still would not let them apply. She forced students to take SMPs or Post-bacs or masters.

Why was she even on the health committee when she had no relevant experience or degrees to prove herself? She never been to medical school nor had a MD, PhD, or DO.

So now imagine having 6 Cs on your transcript and being in lecture with a complete nutjob who didn't even teach real science and who wasn't a PhD scientist herself.

Eventually a lot of the alumni with nothing left to lose, reported her. But they didn't report her to Director of the program. The director of the program would never have done anything as he was complicit in the money embezzlement to some extent.

I have seen so many tears and even possible suicide attempts in this program and many attribute it to Professor Aly and the way she treated people. At least 4 of my friends expressed concerns for their own mental health over Professor Aly.

Before taking Professor Aly's classes, I had a 3.8 GPA. When I was in the rollercoaster, it went to a 2.8 GPA. Before I blame anyone, I asked myself so many questions and how to improve myself. Also transferring out of the program would have hard and impose a financial burden that would set me back $100,000.

It never mattered to me how hard I studied or how long. Professor Aly told me she never liked me because she and I disagreed on politics. That's very unprofessional and that does not give her the right to mess up my grades and future. Again, I even had to fact checked by exams by Google and by other biology professors at other universities.

What is weird is that as a 20 year old, I had more research experience and papers than her. I had 1 research paper and she had 0. She also spent 7 years in a PhD and still managed to come out with 0 papers. No wonder she was fired.

Since the director was not going to do anything, there was perfect timing when the university appointed a new incoming department chair. This department chair was going to replace the old department chair who was too involved in research and not in the dramas. Once the alumni started to report her to the new department chair, soon the current students from freshman to seniors reported her. Eventually she was fired and everyone had a celebration with cake in the lounge and so much profanity was used to describe her. By then, I was a senior and about to graduate.

My undergrad GPA is still tanked from all the bad grades she gave me. I still have video and audio lecture recordings of her pseudoscience. I still have copies of her poorly graded exams. I submitted them all to the university to thoroughly investigate.",college,Need some perspective on this: One professor who ruined many students' lives and careers,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g3sngn/need_some_perspective_on_this_one_professor_who/,1587257112.0,can't pay for school,10.986666666666666

Never thought I'd be one to make a post like this, but I'm getting desperate. Hope I don't make this too long...

I'm a senior in college, about to graduate in a few weeks. This is the third year I've lived off campus in my own apartment. Before living at school, I lived with my mother, sister, and grandmother. During that time, my grandmother fraudulently used my social security number to open a credit card and failed to pay it back. 

Let's backtrack. My grandmother was not a very good person to us when she was alive. She was very manipulative, verbally abusive to my sister and I, and had almost every decision that any of us made was based around whether or not it would make her upset. It was a tough living situation, but we couldn't afford to live elsewhere - my grandmother owned the house we shared. Likewise, my mother insisted upon giving her ""second chances"" because this woman was her mother. I understood why she'd often turn a blind eye during less important fights we'd have or whatever, but it was obviously incredibly frustrating when something actually serious would happen and my mother wouldn't do anything about it. I, embarrassed and often really confused about what to do, never told anyone about my living situation outside of close friends, who also never really knew what to do about it. But can you blame me? I was a kid, I didn't want to call out my family on things that I weren't even sure were serious or not. 

That changed after leaving high school. A short time after going to college, I started getting letters from a credit card company that I didn't have an account with asking me to pay a substantial amount of money that I definitely didn't have: over $2,500. I looked into the statements that were sent alongside the bill and found out that the card was opened in 2004 - I would've been only 14 years old, way too young to legally open a card. I assumed the bills were well crafted scams, and didn't pay attention to them (possibly stupidly, but like I said, I was just a college freshman at the time). A short time later, I received a summons - the credit card company was suing me for a card I had never used or even knew about. I went to court, explained the situation as I knew it best, and showed them my driver's license and passport to prove my current age. My case was declared ""dismissed without prejudice."" This means that the court says that I don't have to pay the credit card company right now, but they can still ask me to pay the amount if they so choose. If they were to sue me again and the court ruled in my favor, it would most likely be declared ""dismissed with prejudice,"" meaning the company would no longer be able to ask me to pay. However, because it's without prejudice, the glaring mark on my credit reports that claim I had a card ""charged off"" will still remain until the card company decides that I don't have to pay it.

Because of that mark, I am unable to open my own credit card for myself, so over the last year I have only had bank accounts in my name, which up to this point has been perfectly fine. My mother added me onto her credit card account for a short while for emergencies, which I used responsibly. I had this card from 2009 up until the end of 2011, never missing a payment and only using it when I absolutely needed to. It was sort of a backup plan, as I do not have a proper savings account or emergency fund (I can thank grandma for that too. Apparently, the savings account that she had ""graciously"" opened for me (""But you can't access it, or you'll just spend the money, so i'll watch over it for you."") on one of my birthdays had been withdrawn from enough from her to deem it basically useless.). At the end of last semester, my mother had to take that card back because she fell into debt and had to close the account.

To compensate for not having that card, I picked up more hours at my job. I make $11 an hour there and work basically whenever I'm not in one of my classes or at my required unpaid internship (my major requires an internship for at least one semester before allowing students to graduate and most internships around where I live are unpaid). I also cut back on extra expenses - I stopped drinking completely, started buying groceries on a need base and tried to budget my money as best as I could, choosing to spend every weekend and work night working or doing homework instead of going to bars or other fun outings with friends. I was doing okay. Not great, but okay. I had a little extra at the end of the first couple of months, and started trying to build a bit of a savings account for myself.

I worked my ass off and it didn't help. Life has a way of creating obstacles at the worst moments and decided that this was the semester to send me a lot of them. Last month, my purse was stolen. My purse contained my wallet, my car keys, a camera, my passport (normally this was kept in my safe with other important documents and items but I had gone to Montreal the weekend before and had forgotten to take it out), and a few personal items. Almost everything was replaceable, but at a cost. Whoever had my purse now had my license and my car keys. I needed to get my door locks changed or risk my car getting stolen. I brought my car to the shop and got my locks changed - for a whopping $800. That's more than what I pay for groceries, rent, and utilities every month. At this point, I barely had that in my accounts, but I had to pay it somehow... Without my car, I can't drive to work, and if I can't drive to work then i don't have a job and if i don't have a job... the cycle goes on and on. 

My first thought was to ask my mother for help, but she was struggling with finances as well. I went to my father next, but he is in the same boat. So, I cut into my homework time and picked up any extra hours that I could. Because of this, I am currently struggling to not only finish my school work on time to even graduate without a failing grade, but I still can't cover everything with the money i've earned. My accounts have all been overdrawn and my utilities companies have sent me warning notices about late payments. The worst part about it is that once I graduate, I can no longer work at the job I currently hold because it's an on-campus position, held only by current students. I've been applying for multiple jobs in the area and secured one for after I graduate - finally some good news! 

Well, not so much. See, graduation is still a good three weeks or so away. Because my funds have disappeared and am now in debt, I'm terrified that I'm going to be kicked out of my apartment. I can't put in any more hours at work, I have no other means to pay for anything, my accounts are very overdrawn, and I have no idea what to do or how to get myself out of this situation.

Currently, my total debt for rent, utilities, and car payments is a little over $1,500. That's not even including food or toiletries or dog food or anything else that at this point has kind of become less of a priority over actually having a place to live. Going back to living at home is not an option - I already renewed my apartment lease, having secured a job for myself post graduation. Likewise, up until this semester, I've been mostly fine living on my own for the past few years. However, I am now completely broke and I have no idea what to do.

My question for you, if you've actually read this far down, is what do I do now? I have until the end of the month to come up with over $1k. I've never been in this situation before and don't know where to turn. I know that once I start working post graduation I can get back into the system I was on and be able to pay for everything normally again, but I don't know what I can do about the next few weeks. I know many people suffer worse debt than I do and many other college students suffer with money situations, but I've always tried to be really responsible about money so as to not fall victim to debt. Yet, here I am anyway.

EDIT. Totally forgot to give a little more detail about my current living situation. I live in an apartment with two roommates and my boyfriend. I also take care of my dog from back home that I've had since high school. My boyfriend lately has been paying for almost all of my dog and my food for the past month as I've used that money to try to cover bills. I don't feel comfortable asking my roommates or other friends for that kind of money because I know most of them have their own financial woes. I also don't want to ask my boyfriend for more than what he's already helped me out with.",AskReddit,Help! Completely broke and feeling overwhelmed.

CJ64Bit,1628641905,/r/college/comments/p2228x/honest_advice_from_a_recent_college_graduate_and/,"•if you can commute and/or live at home (assuming you have a healthy home life to do so) then live at home. Living in the dorms is expensive and unless you are fortunate enough to have all of it paid off and it’s no problem then save those thousands on thousand of dollars and live at home, it sucks and you’re not going to get the “college experience” but you can still visit friends on campus and go out with them. Privacy and freedom will come later, I promise. 

•Look for on campus jobs if you need money. Most schools offer on campus positions of all types from IT to tutoring to manual labor to even being an RA which can offer you benefits and tuition deductions, ask around and see what fits you. 

•You’re not the main character, the dorms don’t belong to you. No matter how adult you think you are, no matter what you believe is in your rights, understand that the residence halls on your college campus have rules and they do apply to you. Don’t be a nuisance to the staff or your peers just because you believe it’s your right to go and scream to your hearts content or whatever it may be. Be respectful to those around you and those of us who don’t get paid enough to deal with you. 

• Don’t bring too much but don’t skimp on bringing things for later seasons. You may not need a winter coat now but you will in a few months and honestly it’s better to have things you’ll need later than to worry about getting them later. Remember that whatever you move has to be moved out and that can be a lot of work. Save yourself the hassle and pack relatively light. 

• Change your major. If you’re not happy with what you’re doing, change your major, it’s never too late. It may set you back, it may be hard to explain, but it does you no good to continue on with some major you have lost passion for. It’s okay to switch majors and studies show that 1 in 5 college students change their major at some point in their lives. Before you do, take the time to understand how much it may set you back and what other fees may come with this change in major as well as if any grants or scholarships are major/field specific.

•Drop out if you feel you need to. This is advice that many people will likely throw their nose up at me and tell me how wrong and irresponsible this is but...if college isn’t for you, if you’re going to fail out, if the education you need can be received through a training program elsewhere, whatever it may be, dropping out is a valid option. The course load for many majors is tough and you need to pull through and get your work done in order to succeed but for many, college just isn’t for them and that doesn’t make these people failures or anything of the sort. Don’t let someone persuade you into continuing with college if it is going to just put you in a hole of debt that is doing you no good to begin with. 

•Go to the campus events. Not all of them will be your thing and I’m not saying go to all of them but you’d be surprised who you may meet there or the fun you may have. They may seem cheesy, and likely some of them will be, but if you have a passing interest just go and see what’s there. 

•Utilize student health services while you’re a student. On campus student health facilities can provide a lot of testing youre going to pay for elsewhere, many on campus clinics (this differs per school) offer STD/UTI testing, strep testing, and can provide basic medicine, checkups, and even basic consultation. This shit is expensive out in the real world, get it free while you can. 

• Don’t join a frat or sorority if you can’t handle it. People love to party. People want to find friends. People want to feel apart of something and frats or sororities are a great place to do all of these things but you are a student first and a Greek life member second. If you are not responsible enough to balance you Greek life and your student life, then very quickly both of those can be ended at the same time if you get kicked off campus for your grades dropping. 

•Respect your RAs. We don’t want to be cops, most of us don’t anyways. We know you’re college kids just like us and we want you to not feel like you’re under constantly monitoring but if you really want every single infraction you do to be reported we can especially if you’re an asshole towards us. Why should we respect you if you don’t respect us. Trust me, it’s obvious when you’re high. We know when you’re drinking in your room. We know when you’re sneaking people in. We have seen it a million times and you’re not the one sneaky one to get it past us and if you really want us not to care than treat us with basic respect and we will let so much go by, we don’t want to write the report. 

•Don’t room with your friends. It may seem like a good idea but you don’t realize how quickly someone’s living habits can annoy you. It’s better to keep hating someone you already don’t like than it is to hate someone you were once friends with. I’ve seen so many people end up hating their friends or moving out of a room situation with their friends because they realized it was a bad idea. This isn’t the case for every pair or grouping of friends so you could be different but I just wouldn’t risk it. 

•DO NOT buy books before you absolutely know if you need them. So many courses “require” textbooks but never use them and often times you can’t return brand new books for full price, especially if they come with an online code. Feel the class out for a week or two or talk to others who have taken the class, save your money where you can. 

•Know your attendance policies per class. Listen, you’re paying for this education and if you don’t want to show up for Mrs.Simmons 8am English class and she doesn’t care, then don’t but know that you need to make up for what you missed. Know when your tests are. Know what the important grades are. It will not kill you to miss class but be prepared to know what you need to accomplish on your own. You don’t need to worry about being the perfect student unless the class/professor is enforcing that sort of behavior. If you want to attend for your own personal reasons and to get the most out of that tuition cost, that’s also totally okay but recognize when you need to take a mental health day or when you just need time off. 

•Befriend professors, especially those you’ll have for multiple classes, they will help you out with so much and are such a good resource of knowledge and recommendations down the road or maybe even a genuine friendship once you’ve graduated. Having a good relationship with your professors means that you come to mind on recommendations for student positions, interviews, awards, or even possible work opportunities. They want to see you succeed and you’ll thank them for all they’ve done for you if you take the time to become close to you. 

• Know what services are available to students. My campus had a work center that loaned out suits and dresses for interviews and even had student works who were there to practice in mock interviews. We had study rooms you could reserve so you had a quiet place for you and/or your friends to study. We had a print shop where you could print out anything you wanted for a small price up to like 6ft tall by however long. Each college campus has a lot of services you probably don’t know about that can come in handy under the right circumstances. 

• If you get in trouble, own up to it, and take your punishment in stride. Every school is much harder on people who lie and deny when they’ve clearly done something wrong. Punishment can go from a slap on the wrist and a stern talking to, to meeting about your removal from a certain dorm or maybe even the campus real quick. You’re an adult, take responsibility for your actions. If you show those in charge of you that you’re not capable of acting like an adult, you’re more closely observed and are going to be treated more harshly. Whatever your punishment is, do it or respect it, because failure to do either will escalate whatever you were served to something more severe. 

• Know your campus’s policies regarding your rights as a student. Don’t let campus police, the RAs, or the various offices give you false information. There will be people who will lie to you to make their job easier or to try and frame you in a negative light. Understand your rights as a student, even if you have to find loopholes and force technicalities, definitively knowing campus policies can and will save your ass.

• If you don’t want to/can’t go home for the holidays or breaks. Talk to your housing office about staying. Many campuses allow for students with special circumstances to stay if it beneficial to their overall well being or even if you need to stay for work.",college,Honest Advice from a Recent College Graduate and 3 Year RA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/p2228x/honest_advice_from_a_recent_college_graduate_and/,1628663505.0,school is too expensive,10.886666666666668
insertxthanks,1580455894,/r/socialwork/comments/ewku8n/conflict_with_supervisor_struggling_to_even_walk/,"Will try to make this as short as possible but I feel like back story is needed to build an understanding of the situation. All names have been changed to protect the innocent and the not so innocent even if they pretend to be empathetic and understanding and innocent of any wrong doing....

My husband, Jack, and I met in early recovery from substance use, so we were working on rebuilding our lives when we first got together. Struggled for first couple years while I went back to school and he worked multiple jobs.  We got married as I was finishing up my bachelor's and he landed a great job working working for a county's mental health dept. as a Peer for people with SUDs. He was excelling at his job and he was building an incredibly successful SUD peer program for the county. All admin loves him, like a lot, and it can be annoying at times, you will find out why if you keep reading. 

Once I finally graduated and had some CM experience he encouraged me to apply for a CM position at the county as the pay and benefits were way better than my nonprofit job. I was offered a CM position in the children's and families program. I had no experience working with kids and was also nervous about working with husband. Offices on same floor, he has huge office in administration (told you administration LOVES him) and I would share tiny office around the corner with 3 coworkers and 1 supervisor whom we will call Nag. 

As I learned the new position, I built a caseload pretty quickly. I love working with youths and I also really liked my team. We all got along great and chatted all the time because we share this tiny office. However, I did noticed Nag was very nit picky about paperwork, all the rules, how to interact with clients, policies... just super controlling about everything. She also has issues with a lot of staff. Our other boss who oversees CMs and clinicians, lets call her Athena, seemed nice enough, but I was told by Nag within my first 2 weeks that Athena is terrible. She literally shut our office door when I first started and talked shit about Athena for over an hour (this made me uncomfortable and seemed unprofessional). There is some big feud between Nag and Atena because Nag wanted a promotion but it went to someone else. Then they made Nag supervisor of CMs to appease her. Like they just created the supervisor title for her. She still has a caseload but now basically overseas the youth CM team too. 

The first 6 months there were good, even though I noticed more and more that Nag's anxiety crossed over into her role as supervisor. Hard to explain but basicly if I have an opinion that's different than hers regarding how to approach a client, how to organize my files or just anything, she will dismiss my thoughts and tell me to do it her way. I am very easy going and sometimes a door mat so I would always just back down. I also avoided Athena because of all Nags warnings about what a terrible person she is. 

About 6 months after I started Jack lost his best friend and 3 clients to overdoses and Jack himself emded up relapsing. He also had a brief relapse about a yeat after he started this job, well before I worked there, and I knew administration knew about it, because people reported him looking high... but they ignored it because he still did such a good job. That really pissed me off and when they ignored it the second time I was even more frustrated. For 2 months I was trying to deal with my marriage being in shambles and the man I love using drugs while I tried to hang on to my own recovery. Then he got 2 DWAIs in one day, so he had to tell administration. And they did nothing... other than encourage self care, apologize for working him too hard, and telling him he can't drive county car until DWAI court is finished. So he just continued using. So yes, I was a mess. I ended up telling Nag what was going on because she had disclosed to me that she too is in recovery when I first started and I wanted to explain why my work was behind (I was having trouble focusing on work at this time because of all the stress). She shut the door and we talked for hours and she said it was private, shared about her past relationships, and offered support and suggested I tell rest of my team so they could help me out too with rides or whatever. So I did. About a month later he jumped back in to recovery and was back to super star status at work again. I worked on catching up with my work but still held resentments towards admin who are all also technically my bosses too because they are heads of mental health department. 

Soon after he got back into recovery he began target shooting and bought a couple guns. I don't love the idea of guns but was also happy he found hobby. My coworker's husband runs a shooting range so we were talking about it one day in the office. 5 of us in tiny office so Nag jumps in conversation. Nag is very anti gun ans I could tell she was getting mad so I changed subject. She left shortly after and said bye to everyone but me. Well a few days later, Athena and Nag call me into Athenas office and I end up getting a write up saying I am not to talk about personal things in office, especially about my husband who is also an employee, and maintain professional boundaries. I was humiliated. Went to my friend who is therapist there and she told me to go back and talk to Athena again. So I did and Athena told me Nag came to her and said Jack has guns and I have been talking about too much personal stuff and it's making her uncomfortable. Athena said she had to bring it to Admin because of the guns (Jack is not suicidal or homicidal at all!) But it was a liability. Athena was super cool and understanding. Then Nag pulls me aside later and assures me she never said anything to Athena. I had just talked to Athena so I knew Nag was lying right to my face. 

So... a little time has passed. Jack is getting better and better. I started wearing head phones in office to keep my focus while 4 other people are right on top of me, talking, making calls etc... Nag kept trying to chat with me but I do my best not to engage. Just keep my head down, not let all of this break me. I was mad that I got in trouble for basically being a gossip (I am so low drama and gossip, hate it) and Jack is treated like gold. Mad that Nag encoured me to talk openly with her, then when she didn't agree with something or was ""worried"", went right to admin without talking to me first, then lied about it!! But just kept my head down and tried to just focus.

Here's the real issue though. Ever since this, the controlling shit has gotten bad. I had 6 hours of supervision this month, split into 3, 2 hour sessions in which she basically told me how to run my case load. I don't brag, but I do think I am pretty good at my job. My paperwork is almost caught up and most of my families like me. But she tells me to do everything her way!! So I recently started going to vacant offices the days I am in office most of the day to get away from Nag. I know it's pissing her off. I can just sense when she doesnt like something, so right away I got confirmation from Athena that I can use vacant offices to work in. Also talked a little about what's going on with Nag to Athena just to leave a paper trail. 

Today I walk in and on my desk is a list of things that I have due. Nag sat there and went through all my cases and picked out all the things I have due. She didnt do this for any other members of team and I know they are all just as behind on some things!! And 90% of what was on list is done, I just need to enter into EHR. We didn't say a word to each other. I tossed list aside, did a little work, then left to meet with some clients. 

So that's where I am at. I feel targeted by Nag and bullied. It's super uncomfortable and she makes me feel like everything I do is wrong. I am not the only one with these feelings. Athena said that Nag's insecurities about her supervisor role causes her to be like this..... I just want to be able to do my job without feeling like everything I do is scrutinized or that she is going to go to Admin about something to get me in trouble. Her behavior is super passive aggresive and I feel ready to snap on her.

horrormaniaac,1644355624,/r/socialwork/comments/snvciy/restart_life_tech_rehab_that_should_be_avoided_at/," 

**I am not anti tech rehab or anti tech therapy/mindfullness. Before you reach for ReSTART Life as a service, please read.**

I worked at a Tech Rehab for a few months over this last summer. It was garbage and run by a greedy CEO and co founder. Below is a quick review I'm trying to get accepted on Glassdoor so others don't work there. I also want to warn families before they decide to spend the outrageous tuition rate and send their children.

I'll add more details later as I work full time and have a lot of other things going on right now...I'm hoping to get this information out to a lot of people in the gaming community especially.

There were definitely clients that did not belong in the program. There are definite signs that some kids did not have a major issue with tech addiction and Restart was more like a drop-off site for ""problematic"" kids whose parents just don't want to deal with.

In my experience, family therapy would have been more effective or even just familial bonding would have benefitted these kids more. Before accepting the job position, I was told that family therapy was a big part of the program but parents were never held accountable for how they interacted with their children and were infrequently brought in to help their own children. Instead, it was always up to the clients to get better and be better. This fails since ""addiction"" usually has other factors at play such as family dynamics, trauma, comorbidities, etc.

The client base is all wealthy families who have a ton of expectations for their kids. They usually fail to realize that gaming and tech are normal. Instead of having healthy conversations about how to interact with tech, the clients were demonized for being ""addicts"". Many clients were in several extracurricular activities, on the path to high school graduation, socialized positively with their peers, and had great things going for them. Tech addiction seemed like a catch-all for kids who enjoy video games and out-of-touch parents who fail to realize that a lot of socialization happens online nowadays.

There is no official screening tool for admittance other than an extremely short survey that parents often would fill out for their child. If the family can pay the tuition and Restart likes what they see on the application, they will admit the client. In my experience, it seemed like the wealthier and more connected a client and their family was then the more likely they were to be accepted and to stay in the program.

Some of the other clients needed different mental health services that Restart is not equipped to handle. Restart would never admit to this, and would keep clients in their program as long as they physically could. Restart never referred out when it wasn't a good match. If the client's behaviors were so severe, they would talk down on them and treat them punitively until they left.

Group facilities should be considered a last resort in mental health services as being torn from your family is trauma in of itself. Clients (especially the kids) often talked about being ""gooned"", where someone outside of Restart is hired to take you from your home, often in the middle of the night, and transports you to Restart. Some kids were even lied to about where they were going and often by their own parents. In social services, this is not okay. This is unsettling for children and not a good way to build trust in their familial relationships. I was shocked to hear about this and how frequently it happens. Also, if you could not transport your child to and from restart, Restart would charge an outrageous amount for driving your child to/from the airport (500$). If the CEO had to come in for any reason outside of her scheduled time, it was written in a policy book that the family would have to pay her hourly rate which was somewhere between $300-500.

The program tried and failed to apply addiction interventions to technology such as the 12 step program and other practices. Unfortunately, the therapy and program steps aren't well translated to handle tech issues and youth.

Restart functions off of tech abstinence which isn't going to be an effective treatment method in the modern world. School, work, socializing, entertainment is all done online now. This all increased with the pandemic as in-person hang outs and events were/are canceled. Many clients reported that they were hanging out with friends via gaming and discord, but their parents failed to recognize that and just assumed they had an addiction to tech. So many younger people socialize online and it doesn't interrupt their daily functioning.

The program was intensely chore orientated. Clients had to make their rooms military style, cook, clean, take care of everything themselves with little time left for therapeutic activities and sessions.The program also advertises lots of hiking and other excursions. Clients who had been in the program for months and sometimes up to a year claimed they RARELY leave campus and the hiking gear they brought is never used. They advertise amenities that don't live up to the advertisements. For example, there's a pool on campus for the youth program. For the longest time, it went unused because they never had staff that had the necessary life guard training. Staff is expected to pay for this training out of their own pockets.

The adult program was sometimes worse. Especially The Ranch. The ranch boasts that they have animals, and a farm that clients can get away from the techy world and feel re-connected with nature. That would be awesome, but there is no official ranch staff other than the group care counselors. This means that ALL farm work is done by counselors and clients. Clients are expected to do ALL the farm work/animal care daily. once in the morning and then again at night and little bits through out the day. They are rushed in this; in their schedule. After caring for the animals, they get LITTLE time to actually hang out and spend with the animals. The horses they care for cannot be ridden. Most clients didn't seem too interested in wandering out towards the animals in their free time as they already spent so much time caring for them. Staff were expected to pick up any slack in farm work if clients refused or there weren't enough clients. Honestly, this part isn't TOOOOO bad if you're into caring for animals and signed up for it BUT I was never told of these employee expectations, and I was never respected as a qualified mental health professional. I was a babysitter and a ranch hand. The co founder would also come and let her family interact and play with the animals - more than the clients ever got to. In relation to everything else about this program, it honestly seemed like the co founder wanted horses, goats, etc. and found a way to get free labor out of her clients in caring for her animals. in fact, they PAY HER to care for them.

There is a lot of money coming in and out of the program. The tuition rate is extremely high- more than college for most people. Program properties/campuses are beautiful million-dollar estates, but all the money seems to go into appearances and not actual services/trained and trauma-informed staff. In order to graduate the program, clients have to receive ""clinical recommendation"" to leave or have their parents pull them out. Clients were well aware that almost no one gets clinical recommendations. This was also noticed by staff. There was one therapist in particular that NO client wanted as it was WELL KNOWN that she never gave clients clinical recommendations.

The one therapist that would graduate and approve clients to leave the program left after a year. He was the only qualified therapist and was getting paid less than market value for his position and qualifications.

Clients would have to repeat activities and sessions due to not getting their recommendation and it just made things worse as all motivation to do better was lost. Clients never felt like they could do things right.

Overall, clients aren't engaged in real therapy or a real therapeutic program. They demonize their clients, don't do half of the things they advertise and don't allow kids to be kids. They clearly don't understand things like ADHD, Autism, ODD, and other behavioral domains.

There is a lot of greed and weird boundaries that get crossed. For example, HR is one person and she is the assistant for the CEO. Fear of retaliation for coming to HR was an issue. Clients AND staff who made their concerns with the program known, were dismissed, kicked out, asked to leave and/or fired.

Staff are paid way below what they should if they're ACTUALLY qualified mental health professionals. This creates tons of turnover, and the program is barely put together enough to keep the place running. There were glaring pay discrepancies between staff who held the same position and had similar qualifications. Staff were told not to discuss this.

**This place is run by out of touch adults who are terrified of technology and the internet OR even worse, they understand they are the only tech addiction treatment center in the US and are capitalizing on mental illness, and taking advantage of struggling families. It's hard to tell the motivation but I truly believe it's both. The program seeks compliance rather than helping and supporting clients.**

There are so many other things wrong with this place...I could write for hours, but sometimes I don't even know where to start.",socialwork,ReSTART Life: tech rehab that should be avoided at all costs,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/snvciy/restart_life_tech_rehab_that_should_be_avoided_at/,1644377224.0,struggling with tuition,10.806666666666668
_StraightUpLazy_,1446011532,/r/college/comments/3qiy9g/a_passionate_email_is_disapointing_even_the_right/,"**Friend received an email from his physics prof last week, thought I would share it with you guys.**
 
**Is 'Disapointing' even the right word?**
 
 
So I throw aside things in my life I need to do, work through 3AM for a few days to write these notes for you, set up HW problems so that you can get yourself some good hard practice using those notes, and then log in to MasteringPhysics on Monday morning to see what?
 
-- that a mere 21.7% of the class have attempted more than 2 for-credit problems.
 
Ofcourse some (in that 21.7%) have almost finished the HW including some with below average score on the first exam. I am very happy to see that. But I have lost my motivation to ""work ON the masses"" (it's a pun).
 
I have several things with you to share, several emails from you folks. Sadly I'vent had the time to reply to them properly but I'll do so someday.
 
But one email asked me a question and I think an earlier answer to that might have helped some.
 
The situation is something like this -- Last weekend the person returned from their weekend trip to home and emailed me on late Sunday night --
 
""Is it true that the HW is due in 3 days""?
 
Answer: Yes. But it was not due FOR 3 days. HW could end up being due in an hour, if you start it with 1 hour to go.
 
Folks, I spent my entire lecture on Day 1 telling you what to do and not to do, to succeed in this class. I told you weekend is not your party time; not the least in your first semester. If your friends, parents, whoever you are 'hanging out' over the weekend are not asking you whether you are on board with your assignments in your first semester, they are distracting you. If they truly care for you and don't want to see you break down next semester when you will fail to get into your desired major, then they should work to stop distracting you and YOU should work to stop getting distracted. If you want to do well, then watch out. It is one thing to go home but another thing to take that time 'off' from serious catching up.
 
It is appalling enough that I had to spend one full 75 minutes preparing you how to study in college. Your teachers in school and your parents should have done that and not 'let you loose' with that irritating 'do what you want' message leaving you wandering aimlessly not knowing how to cope with college.
 
What is worse is that they and your new found friends are continuing to distract you. I bet even now they are telling you something like 'All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy'....to conclude what? Let's play, to hell with work? Let me tell you that ""All work and No play"" does NOT mean let's do all play and no work. Get your English right.
 
They (and you) need to change that to 'All Play and No Work Gets Jack a Dull Career'. Strike a balance. Extreme actions lead to catastrophe.
 
Few days back I met one of you who has badly failed (not just a low score, but badly failed) one of the easiest 218 exams. We spoke at length for quite sometime on what changes to bring about. Other issues aside, I asked if they go to these games.
 
Me: What time do you stop studying on Saturday?
They: Around 12:30pm Sat
Me: When do you start studying again?
They: around 2:30 pm on Sunday
Give or take a few hours but a good chunk of 24 hrs is wasted.
 
Thereafter they asked 'Can I please go to the BAMA game?' Why? Their parents are coming! I would have felt a lot happier if their parents had asked how much they scored on their first midterms (all classes) and mentored them on how to study (another example of a parent is coming below). Instead, how about waste another 24 hours for a 3 hour game that has an actual run time of 1 hour...Sigh. I feel sad for some of you.
 
Let me tell you that this student has not done a SINGLE HW problem (not even a practice one) from the current HW. I hope they will let their parents know their score on the 2nd midterm and get a pat on the back as well.
 
And ofcourse this person isn't the only one. I met a few others last week, who despite our chat has not done a SINGLE HW problem but I am sure had enough time to spend at 'the game'.
 
Another parent: Last semester I met one of my former students (she got an A in my class and at this point of our meeting she is NOT in my class) in the main floor. It was 8pm. She had brought her parents into the building to show them around campus. She introduced me to her parents. We had a nice chat and then she tells me this:
 
""Professor, my parents have come in to town for the game tomorrow and has even bought tickets for me. I am unable to convince them why I should not be going to this game cause I have a midterm on Monday"".
 
This is how BAD some parents are. But at the same time, this is also the spirit a real ""A"" has. You need to develop an attitude like hers. Learn to resist temptation, take responsibility of your actions and your life and pay heed when a professor (likely the only professor) sends you mails like these. Pinch yourself nice and hard and wake up from your dream world. Real world is different.
 
Want to watch the game? Who says no? I ddin't. Turn on that TV and watch it for 3 hours. Then go back to studying. You can't waste your weekend on one stupid game be it whatever game.
 
I told you on day 1, this class needs 17 hours of your time PER week for the average student to get an average grade. Not to get your A. If you ignored it, don't cry later. If you are going to take your weekends 'off' then find those 17 hours on the other 5 weekdays just for this class. i.e. 3.5 hours per weekday just for this class. Can't fit so many hours per day on weekdays? Then don't take your weekends off. Sleep, rest, listen to relaxing music and study if you want to get into your desired major.
 
Throw away all your enrollments in this organization, that organziation, this fraternity, that sorority, VP of this, CEO of that. No body will give a damn to any of these if you don't get into your major. 'Extra curricular' means extra to a GOOD curricular achievement. Fix the later first. There is plenty of time in your undergraduate career for all your 'extra' things. Does it have to be in your first semester when you are trying to learn how to cope with pressure and classes and homeowork?
 
For the last time, once again -- Getting into these majors is fiercely competitve. More challenging than going to Hell. Students have been denied application (let alone admission) because they fell short by a GPA of 0.04 (I know one case personally). Good luck to you!
 
Lastly, this mail is my last mail of concern to you. I am not 'mad at you' because you haven't started the HW. I won't be mad at you either if you don't do the HW. Do or don't, ace the exams and make sure you have enough points on other things to get your grade. But let me tell you this -- you can get 90% on midterms yet miss the A, because you will perform miserably on my final exam if you don't do my homework and practice problems.
 
It is upto you, how you would achieve your targets. Its your life, your career and will soon be your increasing debt as you end up delaying your graduation. Make sure to save your Aggie tickets and your A+ passes so that you can place them as stickers on your debt portfolio. Afterall, you should be able to connect the right 'cause' to the observed 'effect'.
 
Let the test average on exam 2 be 30. I promise you one thing, I won't curve it even if every other professor curves. I am not going to tell you 'its ok if you got 30, let's just call it 50'. No, you get 30, you are living with it. If in the real world, after you mess up at work if your boss could come to you and say 'I'm sorry you messed up, how about I give you a raise?"" then maybe such an expectation would make sense.

Bronegan,1515078492,/r/college/comments/7o3jbh/riding_and_college_tips_for_prospective/,"I had posted this to r/horses and r/equestrian, but not all those horse crazy subscribers can benefit from this post as not all of them are in/going to college.  So  I figured I'd post it here as well in case there are people interested in this.

**Introduction**

College is a big decision for people.  To narrow down a school based on career prospects and location is a daunting task, and it isn't made any easier if you consider other factors as well.  I can't really offer you any insight on how to decide which school has the best food, but I can help you look at equestrian opportunities of various schools.  These ultimately boil down to 3 separate types: school run equestrian programs, student run programs, and private barns.  They all have their pros and cons which I've listed below.





**School Run Equestrian Programs**

These programs are run by the college or university at facilities that are often owned by the college/university.  Competitive riding teams are often coached by college faculty.  Many of these schools have much smaller student communities that may only number in the hundreds to a few thousands

*Pros*

* Equestrian centers are a part of campus, thus there is usually easy transportation or access by the students to them.

* Many schools will use their equestrian centers as classrooms and provide majors related to the equine industry.

* Many schools and programs have easy access to the equine industry through personal networks of the faculty.  Can make finding an equine job very easy.

* Some schools have a very good reputation for their equine programs and can make getting an internship or job much easier.

* Horse show competitions can be held on campus, definitely beats getting up at 4AM for a 3 hour drive to another school (You'll probably still have to get up at 4AM to care for the horses though).

*Cons*

* Can be quite competitive. If you aren't riding that frequently, you might not make it onto the competition teams.  Some of the riders who are applying for these schools ride daily and compete regularly within organizations like USEF and AQHA. If you do make it to the team, then showing is usually mandatory.

* Many schools running their own equine programs will not have nearly as much variety in choice of majors for other fields.  Also, the programs they do have may not be as highly ranked.

* Can be rather expensive.  An equestrian center with a couple dozen horses usually isn't cheap.

**Student Run Organizations**


These kind of programs are run by the students, for the students with support from the college/university.  They will often hire a nearby horse trainer/barn owner to be the coach for the team.  Different colleges offer differing amounts of support to the team and some schools cover all travel expenses for collegiate competitions.

*Pros*

* Excellent leadership opportunities if you're interested. Lead the team as captain, or manage the finances.  Be in charge of membership or team events.  Any of these positions give valuable experience for any career.

* Can be very economical, depending on school support.  It will almost always be cheaper than riding at a school run program.

* Can be found almost anywhere in the country.  Schools you might not associate with horses very likely do have a team.

* Will usually be much more laid back and open to anyone.  Usually more beginner friendly than other programs, competitions are usually optional, and will usually have a larger variety of rider backgrounds.

* Larger schools will often have very good programs and a wide variety of majors to choose from (Engineering might not have a lot to do with horses but at least you'll have the money for a horse! Time is another issue entirely)

*Cons*

* Programs are often unknown.  You may have to look for the program.  (Ohio State has an equestrian team?!?! Yes. Yes they do.)

* The teams will usually not attract the best riding talent from high school, though it would be unwise to dismiss them for it.

* Many of these teams need to fundraise or participate in community service.


**Private Barns**

If the school doesn't have a student equestrian team or an equestrian program of their own, odds are there is a local private barn with riding lessons available to you.  These are going to be local trainers or horse owners that are horse crazy and proud of it!

*Pros*

* You can find one just about anywhere in the continental USA, Canada, and even Alaska! I can't speak for Hawaii but they probably exist there too.

* Usually very flexible with lessons. Only constraint is YOUR schedule.

* Small barn families make for great stories and adventures.  The dorm won't be your home, the barn is!

* Working student positions are more likely to exist

* There is rarely only just one barn nearby, enabling you to compare lesson prices if you wish.

*Cons*

* Very limited, if any, competition opportunities.

* Getting rides to and from the barn without a car can prove challenging

* Local barn owners may not have enough experience to teach beyond a certain level


Though these are 3 basic categories, every program is different and there will be advantages and disadvantages that might not be listed above.  I encourage you to look at each program individually.  Next, I'm going to discuss competition organizations.





**Collegiate Competitions**

At the collegiate level, there are multiple organizations that oversee the competitive riding teams across the country.  Some are specific to schools, while others cater to a specific discipline.  Some of the main programs in the United States are the NCEA (National Collegiate Equestrian Association), the IHSA (Intercollegiate Horse Show Association), IDA (Intercollegiate Dressage Association), and the American National Riding Commission (ANRC).


*NCEA*

A part of the NCAA, this organization oversees women's equestrian teams across 23 United States schools.  This is the only one of the 4 that is exclusively for women.  The NCEA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining (in other words, both hunt seat and western riding).  For more information, check out their website at http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/


*IHSA*

Founded by Bob Cacchione (I have a mug signed by him) in 1967, this organization has grown to serve almost 400 schools across the continental United States and Canada.  The organization has approximately 8400 riders participating in horse shows all across the country.  The IHSA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining.  The main difference between the IHSA and NCEA, besides member schools, is the IHSA does not have any gender restrictions.  Also, while they both offer the same assortmant of riding diciplines, the scoring system between them are different.  The IHSA offers competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.ihsainc.com/        For a listing of current teams, check out https://members.ihsainc.com/publicteaminfo/currentteams.aspx


*IDA*

Founded as an informal competition between northeastern United States schools in 1995, the IDA now has more than 50+ member schools across the country.  The organization provides competitions for Dressage, possibly the most ""artsy"" form of riding (I don’t mean this in a dismissive way, I have the greatest respect to those who make dressage look easy).  They offer competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.teamdressage.com/home


*ANRC*

Founded in 2006 and an affiliate of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and the United States Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the ANRC has served 80 schools through the ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship.  Riders may compete in one of two levels: a National level at 3’ and a Novice level at 2’6”.  Teams and riders are judged in their performance through 4 phases of competition.  For more information, check out their website at http://anrc.org/





**Conclusion and Author's Note**

There is a lot of information out there for prospective collegiate riders, and trust me when I say that you don't have to give up your riding just to go to school.  So many opportunities exist for almost every interest, and I can practically guarantee that you will find a school and a riding program that is right for you.  Some schools even have multiple teams, which can give you the opportunity to compete in multiple collegiate organizations.  

My own experience with collegiate riding has been through a student run organization (Semi Varsity Club Sport) and I have primarily competed within the IHSA.  My knowledge of the other competitions are limited to what I could gather from their own websites and Google so I encourage you to do your own research into those organizations or contact them and ask directly.  If you have questions specific to the IHSA or student run equestrian teams, my own experience can probably answer your question or at least point you in the right direction.  

Lastly, many teams (student run and school run) have websites with information about their team.  Some of these teams offer programs like a ""Test Ride"" where high school students can get a tour of campus and of equestrian facilities, a lesson or introduction with the team coach, and a day as a ""member"" of the team.  Take advantage of these and see what a day in the life of a collegiate equestrian is like.  For the IHSA specifically, their member list that I provided has links to many of these websites.  Take a look at what is out there, you'll find something.

TommySalami69696,1539559924,/r/college/comments/9o7hnd/does_anybody_else_feel_like_their_friend_group/,"I'm a sophomore in college right now, and I feel like I'm in a very weird position. Allow me to explain.

Back in highschool, I was in a number of ""friend groups"", I guess you could say. Freshman year, I had that small core group of friends who didn't really split up right at the beginning who I'd eat lunch with. That group disbanded, and I was alone for a while. Eventually, I found myself in a new friend group my junior / senior year, with a couple of dudes (only one of which I'm still friends with for a long number of reasons), that's done now too. My freshman year of college, I found myself in a new friend group: I made a new friend who I went to HS with by running into him at a lunch hall, I made friends with some people who lived on my dorm hall, I met some people through them, etc. But now, I don't feel like I'm part of any ""friend group"" anymore.

The group that I had from last year is pretty much gone. Some of my old friends had to move far away to live with family because they couldn't afford dorming anymore. One of them (a girl I was pretty close friends with) ended up getting an apartment off campus and now lives with 3 other girls and has pretty much forgotten I exist. Some of them were closer to my ex than they were to me, so they're out of the picture. Some of them left the ""group"" before the year was even over.

Now I still feel like I'm friends with some of these people on an individual basis. I eat breakfast with my friend from HS a few times a week, because we just so happen to be on the same campus at that time of day for classes. I've hung out with one of the other girls who had to move away a few times, but it's rare because of the distance. I don't have any ill will towards any of the people that I don't talk to anymore, they're just living with their new friends and doing their thing, and I just didn't fit in anymore... I guess.

Now I've made a few new friends through classes this year, but I feel like it's becoming more and more apparent just how much I'm not part of a ""group"" anymore. One of my friends (who seemingly has way more connections than me), we'll call him Z, has invited me out to hang out at this person's house party, or this person's apartment kickback, etc, and it's making me realize just how not part of any ""clique"" I am anymore. I tried to make friends with the people that he's gotten involved with recently, and it doesn't seem like they want anything to do with me (they leave my messages on read, say they're busy, don't invite me out to things that I know Z is going to with them, etc.), but he's dating one of the girls in the middle of the whole clique so I figure before long he's just going to get wrapped up more and more with her and her life / friend group (since they'll include him if she wants them to), and less and less with me, because having me around his new group of buds would throw a wrench in the middle of everything if they don't want me around, and there's no way he's going to choose me over pussy and a cohesive social circle of people who are already close... that seems to be the way these things just sort of, happen.

Another friend, we'll call him X, lives with his friends / bandmates and hangs out with me to eat / study sometimes, and we've played video games and drank / smoked together and all that, but I still feel like I'm not part of his ""inner circle"" and I never will be. He's older and he lives on the other side of town, so it's no wonder he's already found his people, it's just weird feeling like when he's brought me around, I'm just the ""kid"" who he knows from here, not actually a member of the unit.

It's a strange feeling. It's like, I know a bunch of these people, I feel like we're all on good terms. I figure if they didn't like me, our relationships wouldn't have gone as far as they have. But when these people bring me to meet the people they know, I always feel like I'm ""the outsider"" since I haven't been there from the beginning, and there's no way I'll ever have that depth that they have with eachother. I tried to break my way into one of these friend groups to no avail, and now I actually feel like I'm losing one of my friends to them. I don't like how it feels like I'm on the outside of everything now. It's not that it's a bad thing that the friendships I have with the few people I still do keep in contact with are based solely on the fact that we get along 1 on 1, but it feels *wrong* in some way that I don't know how to put my finger on. It's like I'm peripheral. I'm always the one trying to make plans, I don't get invited out to much, if anything. Maybe my friends don't do much as it is, but not ever being invited to things makes me feel like I'm just ""tolerated"", or these people hang out with me out of a feeling of obligation or just because they know we have a class together and don't want to make it awkward. I don't want to lose all of my new friends after classes change next semester but I feel like it might happen and I'm worried I'm finally about to have like, 0 close friends.

I still live in the dorms because I work as an RA but it's not the same as freshman year. I feel like I took the job out of this misplaced hope that I could re-create the magic of moving out and living among a group of freshman, but as a sophomore, it gets old real fucking quick living on campus where we can't drink or throw parties, and it's not like the people on my hall view me as a potential friend, more like someone who ""works for them"", and they're not wrong, and I don't blame them. All of the ""groups"" that I've run into this year are all people who decided to move into a house together off campus, and it's made me realize just how key that is to the whole ""having a life"" thing, or at least feeling like you belong somewhere. I've always wanted to, and still plan on moving in with my best friend, but he's in a shitty financial rut right now and he won't be ready to move in with me until at least next year, which is when I'll have to decide to keep this RA job or try something else, and I'm definitely leaning towards getting the fuck out of here.

I know I need to ""put myself out there"" more. I definitely could have done a better job talking to people in my classes at the beginning of the year, but people choose their seats and it becomes ""taboo"" to switch it up and make people move around. I need to look for some interesting clubs that I could meet people in, although that could be a crap shoot (it definitely has been so far, of all of things I've shown up to). I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like the further I go into my college years, the more and more behind I'm getting in terms of ""finding my people"". By this summer I'll essentially be halfway done, it doesn't even feel real saying that, the time has flown by so fast.

I know it's stupid to compare myself to others, and I should be thankful for the experiences that I have had since I've gotten here. I know that some people never make any friends in college, I'm happy I'm not in that boat. I got with some cool girls for a night here, few weeks there, couple months with one of em'. I had a lot of great experiences so far. I just don't want it to suck shit from here on out because I feel like all of my bridges have either began to fall apart, or have been burnt entirely.

Did any of you guys find your ""real friends"" later in your college career? Do you have any tips for me to get to know people in my classes / community on a deeper level than just acquaintances? How do I ""break into"" a friend group when I find one? How do I stop being ""the initiator"" and get people to invite me out instead?

I've contemplated that maybe I'm just not an exciting person to be around. Who really knows. I figure even if that's the case, it's not like I can change that. I've tried my best to become a ""better person"" - started working out, stopped playing video games, I dress well, the whole nine yards. I had a 4.0 my first two semesters. On paper I'm not a ""loser"". I'm not prudish or straightedge or anything though. I just wish I knew how people perceived me from the outside.",college,"Does anybody else feel like their ""friend group"" disbanded and now can't find a new one?

appletonoutcast,1267556793,/r/AskReddit/comments/b8csq/reddit_can_i_get_advice_from_anyone_who_has/,"**Wall O' Text for background:**

Towards the end of 2004 I had recently dropped out of my first year at University due to discovering an undiagnosed learning disability that had previously not affected me *too* badly. I was a straight A student in school because I didn't have to work at all. Although I maintained an apartment on my own, I kept under my parent's health insurance due to the American's With Disabilities Act, as I had every intention to go back to school in one years time. I wanted to take a year off to clear my head and find the right meds to help me out with my problem. Dropping out really did a number on my self-esteem. On top of that, I couldn't land a steady job and was unemployed a few times. 

I had decided to find a date via an online service, and that's where I met the crazy Ex. (I'll call her Genevive, or Gen for further use). Gen was going to school at a University nearby and was only a year younger than me. We hit it off immediately, leading to sex on the first date and her staying over quite frequently the first few weeks. It was pretty easy to tell she was damaged goods, but I kept going as I hadn't had a decent lay in nearly a year, and was starting to get really lonely. 

Needless to say, this was the wrong idea. I should have dropped it, but I kept on like a moron. She professed her love for me in two weeks, and had practically moved in with me by three weeks. At that point, she stopped going to school and just stayed at my place all the time (another red flag, I know). I was working full time at a major retailer at that point, and wasn't making an exceptional amount of money. I would literally use the money my parents kindly gave me to pay the Co-Pay on my meds and use it for living expenses.

Needless to say, this woman turned out not only to be a complete parasite, but a complete nutjob. Some highlights include:

* Going through 12 jobs in the year and a half we dated. This includes Night stocker at the store that I worked at after I recommended her the job. The longest she kept a job was for 3 months.

* Having me buy us things on my credit as hers was shot due to unpaid bills (including a new bed and PC).

* Snooping through my PC and deleting things she felt were undesirable, and just spying on me in general

* Cutting herself

* Faking overdosing on OTC painkillers to get attention

* Snorting my meds

And this doesn't include the multiple instances of mental and physical abuse. She would explode at me over the slightest provocation. When i caught her previously snooping on my PC, I passworded it. In retribution, she cut the cord of my expensive gaming mouse ""To teach me a lesson"". Here's the email she sent me to taunt me about it.

&gt; So you fucking think it's fucking funny to lock your computer?  Fuck you!  I will NOT be here when you get home you prick.
&gt; I cut the cord to your precious mouse you asshole piece of shit.  Why would you even do that?  If I were to lock my computer, I'd get fucking screamed at.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...................I hate you right now 

On top of that, she would physically attack me. The first time was when (god I can't believe I'm actually admitting to this) my guild in World of Warcraft started raiding Molten Core in the beginning of the game. Her guild wasn't yet doing it. So she freaked out, punched me in the head, and threw a laundry basket at my head too out of jealousy.

Other incidents include her hucking a jar candle at my head and putting out a cigarette on me.

The coup de grace is that (if it wasn't apparent before) she is legitimately crazy. She was admitted to a mental ward for overnight observation due to suicidal thoughts. And since breaking up with me, she has been diagnosed with really bad Bipolar disorder (she IM'ed me on a throwaway account screaming about it.)

She is responsible for so many shitty occurrences in my life, it'd take pages to tell all the stories. So I'll just cut it short right here.

**So....now that the backstory is out of the way here's the meat.**

 I broke up with her mid 2006 with the help of my family. I kicked her out and sent her to her family 400 miles away. Since that time, I have returned all of her stuff to her or disposed of it according to the law. She has no reason to remain in contact with me. And I have told her multiple times to leave me and my family alone.

Over the course of the last four years she has disappeared for a while only to pop up later with a throwaway AIM or E-mail account to harass me and my family. Although she has never made direct threats against me, she has hinted at it (""I'll send someone up there to kick your ass"", ""I know your class schedule"", etc.) She has also left threatening voice mail messages on my phone.

I have taken the collected transcripts of all these, with me stating in them repeatedly ""I want nothing more to do with you, leave me alone."" I have taken them to the local authorities, as well as the county government to try and get a restraining order or something put on her. Nothing has come from this however. The county basically laughed at me, and the police have shown themselves to be worthless. They in fact LOST recordings of the voice mails she left me, as well as other documents I left with them.

I've since met someone else and am prepared to marry her in October. Gen has herself married, and should have moved on. However, she persists in harassing me to this day. The final straw came 4 days ago.

I must have forgotten to change my facebook password since then, and she hijacked my account. She changed my religious and political affiliation to the opposite of what I am, then made it so I was ""Looking for Men"". She then had me join the Bisexual Alliance and KKK groups. This kind of petty shit is her trademark. The problem is, she now has access to not only my phone number, but my address as well now as I had it posted on my account. She also now has knowledge of what my fiancee looks like and where she works.

She took the time to create a dummy facebook account where she accused my fiancée of ""Looking like a man"" and other such idiotic things. However, the last line of the message she ""Swore she would find out where our wedding is held, and be sure to crash it."" 

My fiancée has officially started to freak about this. The Ex has gone from ""Crazy Annoyance"" to ""Real threat"" in her mind. We're going to try the police again this afternoon, but I don't expect to get any further than we already have. We're going to probably end up hiring a lawyer.

My question is this. Has anyone here on Reddit had similar circumstances? What did you do to get rid of the crazy bitch/bastard in your life that, while, not demonstrating a ""credible"" threat, was really fucking annoying?

**TL;DR**: Crazy Ex who physically and mentally abused me won't leave me alone 4 years later. Although making no direct threats, she's really fucking annoying. Any advice how to get restraining order?

**Edit:** Oh hey, I forgot two of the best stories to add some fun to this.

**Story One:**: She cheated on me once, pretty elaborately. She met someone over WoW, and talked with him. Because she played with him while I was at work, I was none the wiser. All I knew was she was friends with this guy named ""Dan"" and he lived in Arizona. Towards the end of our relationship, when I just stopped caring about anything anymore, she flew down to Arizona to be with him for a week under the pretence of ""Meeting her best friends while they were in the middle of a roadtrip. She flew down and was with that shithead, doing god knows what. In retrospect, this is one of the most depressing moments of my life. Not because I didn't follow my gut and suspect her, but because I met her at the airport with flowers and told her how much I missed her. =(

**Story Two**: I got her knocked up. Worst moment of my life. I thought that my life was totally over, and I would be chained to her for the rest of my life. Luckily, the bitch miscarried. I still can't believe I was so lucky (I'm an atheist, so no comments about god, please). To this day, she claims two things. A) If she would have had the kid, she would have used it as a tool to milk me for every cent I had for 18 years. B) That I physically choked her during the pregnancy, which caused her to miscarry. Of course, this never happened in reality.

If more people are interested, I'll share the story later of how she nearly ruined my cousin's wedding. I don't have the time to type it out now however.",AskReddit,"Reddit, Can I get advice from anyone who has gotten a restraining order on a crazy Ex?...(MN/WI experience most helpful)",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b8csq/reddit_can_i_get_advice_from_anyone_who_has/,1267578393.0,school is too expensive,10.686666666666667
thrwwy_man,1338573178,/r/AskReddit/comments/ufx2v/reddit_i_need_your_help_with_my_career_path/,"Using a throwaway, because there’s a metric shit ton of identifying information.

Hey Reddit, I’m struggling with a job hunt and I’m looking for feedback/guidance/direction/a sounding board.

I’m in my mid-early 30s, married for 8 years to a wonderful woman who is a little older than me.  We have a 14 month old daughter – the absolute light of my life –and we just found out that my wife is pregnant with our second.  We would love for this to be an exciting time, but our financial/employment situation is making our future tremendously scary, to say the least.

I have always had trouble with employment.  I have a college degree, but it’s in the impractical field of film studies.  While I’m in California, I have no desire to work in film production.  I have a family to provide for, and film work is nothing if not intermittent.  Aside from an internship in a film production office more than a decade ago, I haven’t really worked in the film industry at all.

After college, I spent a couple of years – great years – working for an international resort company.  I designed and built theatrical sets and was de-facto stage manager for their nightly stage shows.  I left this company after 9/11 when I decided that I wanted to be closer to home.  I found a job in southern California working at another resort theater, first as a stage hand, then eventually as their technical director.  My stage manager connected me with a friend of hers who had a video production company (think wedding videos and such) and I was able to work part time with him.  The money wasn’t great, but I added a little more to my resume.  In that time, my wife (then girlfriend) and I started dating long distance.  She was a high school teacher and had tenure, so after two years with this particular theater at something like $10/hr, it made sense for me to relocate to where she was.  I was still in SoCal, but too far away to keep working for the theater or production house.  Before I moved, I asked video production owner-guy if they would have a full-time position for me because the theater schedule was just about the exact opposite of my wife’s (at this point, upgraded to fiancé) schedule.  He made an effort to create a position for me, but things took too long to fall in to place, so like I said, I ended up relocating.  No hard feelings.  Shortly after relocating, my wife and I got married.

Over the next two years, I worked for a “marketing” company, but really my time was spent in a warehouse issuing credits for damaged office furniture.  After a year and a half of this, I got an internship, and commuted an hour one-way three times a week to catalogue tapes for a small production company that had connections to the music scene in Long Beach. (the band Sublime, the Ziggens, etc.)  They asked me to edit a few things for them, and I told them that if I was editing, I needed to get paid.  So they wrote me a check for $13/hr.  At this point, I had a bit of a crisis and panicked, because how is a man supposed to support a family in SoCal at $13/hr? (My wife and I still had not had kids yet, but we knew we wanted to, and I was working towards becoming a provider.)

I called my dad, who has had a great deal of success in the insurance/financial services.  I lived many hours away, and we talked about me getting my insurance license and going to work with him in a sort of mentorship relationship.  My wife did not want to do this, as she would lose her tenure.  My argument was that if I was to ever become the provider for our family, we needed to take steps that would put me into that position.  I got my insurance license, and we made the move to a place I’ll just call “the coast.”

About 8 months after we got to the coast, my dad bailed.  He was having trouble with the company we worked for and got a great job in a somewhat similar industry, and there was no room to bring me along.  I wasn’t too bothered, because I picked up his entire book of business and was hoping to nurture that into more sales (read:income).  At the same time, I was also working part time for my church.  They had installed this $75,000 video system and really didn’t know what to do with it, so they paid me about $25,000/yr to design the weekly presentations on it, to keep the campus’ network running, and just be an all-around tech guru.  During this time, I also really built up my photoshop, design and visual presentation skills.  I redesigned the church’s logo and built a sort of brand identity for them.  If it weren’t for the money from my church job, I don’t know how we would have made it.  It supplemented the irregular and inconsistent commissions I was getting.  I wasn’t really cut out for insurance sales.  I have major “call reluctance.”  Who wants to get a call from their insurance guy?  Who wakes up in the morning and says “I want to buy life insurance today?”  So the insurance side of my income stagnated, and there was no room for advancement at my church.

At the same time, my wife was really struggling as well.  We’re now in 2007-8-9, and she had lost her tenure when she changed school districts.  Each year, she would get laid off because she was the most recent hire.  She’s a fantastic teacher – the best, really – so her references were often able to get her hired on in another nearby district.  Still, the job hoping took its toll on our peace of mind and our income.

Two years ago, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first.  While income was not great, we had insurance and we were supporting ourselves.  I still wasn’t making enough to support us all, and my wife couldn’t realistically teach and be a mom at the same time.  She puts so much energy into her teaching job – it’s easily 60 hours/week if not more.

After my daughter was born, my dad had gone back to work for a business owned and operated by our extended family.  This business was located in “the desert,” and was on its last legs due to some health problems my uncle was having.  Dad was trying to keep the business running, and wanted my help.  I put on my negotiating hat and got a large enough salary that I could support my family and we could buy a house.  Due to the lower cost of living in “the desert,” we could finally reach our goals of owning a home and having my wife stay home to be a mom for our infant daughter.

Unfortunately, this family business was doomed before dad even got here.  I won’t get into it, but I got to watch the bank seize all of the company’s assets and destroy my grandparents’ legacy.  This was all due to stuff that had been set in motion a few years back.  Dad and I still saw value in the intangible assets of the company, so we took the customer list and a few of the strongest employees and started a leaner, meaner company.  For six months now, this new company has hobbled along.  We haven’t received any outside funding, and it’s expensive to start a company, especially in California.  We’re working on an SBA loan, but the banks aren’t exactly eager to lend these days.  There has been multiple times where I didn’t know if I was going to get a paycheck, or it’s been delayed by a few days.   

And that’s where I am today.  I’ve got a new house payment, a wife who works too hard to do what she’s always done and still be a mom at the same time, and a job that pays decent money when it pays, but I don’t know if I’m going to see a paycheck next week.  I’m applying for work all over right now, because I’m tired of being afraid of my own ability to pay all of our bills on time.  I want decent income, and I want stability.

Most of the jobs I’m looking at are either entry level and pay about $25,000/yr, or they are specialist positions that require years of experience in a specific field.  So reddit, where should a guy like me go?  I’m a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.  I can do basic graphic design, I have an eye for marketing and presentation.  My experience in theater and time with my church has taught me the importance of precision timing in live production. I’ve been the network admin for three different small business networks.  I think my strategy should be to market myself to a small/medium organization that needs a little bit of all those things, but doesn’t need to hire a specialist in any one field. Am I on the right track?  And if so, how do I find an organization like that?  It’s not like careerbuilder.com turns up something when I search for design/marketing/presentation/IT guru.

lake_is_god,1640595668,/r/college/comments/rpja62/if_it_wasnt_a_private_christian_college_in_a/,"I chose this school because of the athletics, the coaching program and they offered me the most money for my sport. I could have gone to two other schools which were significantly bigger, my friends went their and their rules weren't as strict. But I decided to chose the one I'm in now because of the reason above and also I wanted to get further away from my home town. 
And let's just say there is a big part of me that regrets it.

Don't get me wrong, I've made a lot of friends and the team that I'm on now is one of the best in the nation but other than that, that's about it. Again it's a Christian school so I expected there to be more rules set in place but some of the rules are absolutely ridiculous. First let me just say this. There are two types of people that go to this school. Athletes or Hardcore Christians (HC). There was no mixture. But what really is the kicker is that the number of athletes compared to the HC was significantly higher. The dorm I stay at is pretty much where the boy athletes stay and let's just say if there wasn't these ridiculous rules in place then that place would be burnt to the ground. 

But of course it can't happen because of the rules in place. (BTW the size of the college is about 1,800 undergrads). These rules are some of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard that the other Christian school I debated on going to didn't even have these rules. The one that is legit reasonable is the zero alcohol and drug policy. Is it bullshit, yeah but I sorta get it. It's illegal. And if you get caught you get a contract. You can't even have empty bottles in there which kinda ridiculous but I can kinda see why thats in place. Now that is the only rule that is some what normal. Now let's get into the bullshit.

Non gender mixed dorms: this really has pretty much been abandoned by almost every college and even Christian college for a long time now. Boys and girls have two different dorm buildings. And they are on the complete opposite side of campus from eachother. And what really sends people over the edge is that there are open hall hours which means you had to be out of the opposite genders dorm halls by 10 p.m. on week days or else you get a fine and a contract. It really sucks because college is where you meet new people and start making friend groups but it's almost impossible with these open hours. Even on weekends they kick you out. But what really sucks is that if you have someone of the opposite sex in your room you have to put a coat hanger on the door knop and keep the door open so private time is completely out the window. Even if they are just a friend it still sucks that all the privacy is all but gone. And when closing hours come up, there is always a herd of RA's that roam the halls with their flashlights going into people's room that have a coat hanger to tell them that is almost time. Wouldn't be a big deal... if they bothered to knock. And if they would quit rushing us. I had a girl over just to watch a few movies with and when there was 5 minutes left the RA's just kept on bombarding my door with knocks pretty much giving me a count down to when she had to leave. And when she was leaving I go over to look to my left and there are like 4 RA's standing at the end of the hallway with their flasights just staring at us and making sure she leaves. And even when they clearly saw her with her jacket on walking away from the door they kept on telling her she had to leave. 

Chapel: this one just blows my mind. My school has chapel credits that you have to meet the required amount by the end of the semester. And before you say ""just go to chapel it ain't they hard"", let me just say this... no one likes going to chapel. The messages are complete bogus that even the HC get sick of it. There will be one or two speakers per semester that people actually enjoy but other than that it's awful. And if you don't meet the required amount then you must  pay $25 per credit you missed, write a 3 page long essay explaining why you missed chapel and how it is a sin, and they hit you with a final warning. Meaning if you miss the required amount of credits again then you must not only do the same things listed above but also you automatically fail the semester, no matter what your grades are, and you are suspended from school for 1 semester. 

Ball and chain: you get zero privacy. Not even in your car because they always have campus security driving around making sure no one is doing anything. And you can say ""just go off campus"". Trust me I would but this is a Christian town. They are just as worse with the cops. They always follow you around and never give you any privacy. 

They take religion too seriously: don't get me wrong I've been a Christian since birth but they just use it for everything. I had a friend who was going through depression and when he went to seek help from school employees they just kept saying the same thing "" we'll pray for you"". That's it. They didn't give him extensions on anything or seek help. And when he failed out they kept lecturing him how it was his fault and that God will be with him when he thinks about what he's done when he got academically suspended.

What sucks about this whole thing is that the school glorifies that it is a great Christian school filled with faith when really its just miserable people sick and tired of the people in charge of the place. 

But what I find funny and infuriating at the same time is that if there wasn't all these bogus rules set in place then this would be a great school. We have the people and the personality to do it. My dorm is already pretty much like a frat house with the hidden alcohol and drugs, just with all the bull shit rules in place. College would be a lot more fun cause I see all my friends going to the schools that I was debating on going to having the time of their lives while at the same time me and my friends are sitting on the couch having nothing to do because of the rules set it place. I get licks of what college should be like here in there when I visit my friends sometimes on weekends and I always have fun. I even was shocked when I went to my friends dorm room and his RA was casually drinking a beer with his roomate in the halls. (He also goes to a private Christian school so that just screams bullshit) people at my school do the same thing at their friends colleges. But all of us could only imagine what it would be like to have that luxury at our school. While instead of casually drinking in the dorm rooms not having a care in the world and having friends over no matter their sex is at anytime. But instead I get raided by the RA's because they ""smelled beer"" coming from my room. Now did I have alcohol, yeah why wouldn't I. But I never opened a single bottle and I didn't have any beer in my room. The next week while everyone was at practice they raided all  our rooms, and ignored our privacy. And let's just say there was a lot of contracts and suspensions that were handed out. Hell just last year when one of the players on the football team was handing out L's left and right to the other team the RA's raided his room and found alcohol. They had no reason to do that. He never caused trouble, got along with everyone and he hardly drank in his room. They did it just because they could. 

I'm honestly debating on switching schools at this point cause this past semester just angered me to witness my high school friends at their colleges taking shots with the fucking RA at a tailgating party when we got an email during our homecoming week that alcohol was not allowed at all at the tailgate and that there would be cops patrolling the event with breathalyzers in hand. And God forbid they did find alcohol. They pretty much searched the entire campus when they found ONE busch can laying on tbe ground at the event. But turns out it was one of the football players who shot gunned it and just set it on the ground outside the stadium just to piss off the Dean. They searched my dorm hall during the game because it shares the same parking lot as the stadium. Did they tell us? No. Did the invade our privacy over one beer can? Yeah.

[deleted],1346286684,/r/AskReddit/comments/z1tav/manipulative_family_members_wont_move_out_of_my/,"Okay Reddit, this is something that has been going on for over 4 years. Let's start with some backstory. I am the youngest of three children and my middle brother is 6 years older than me (I'm 22 years old). We haven't always been friendly towards one another, in fact he hasn't always been the best brother to any of us or the best son to my parents. My brother, in short, is a manipulative baby. He cries to get his way and will circle you around when you're trying to have a conversation with him so it ends up looking like you're the bad person. He'll bring up past mistakes of yours in order to win his point which he never really has.

He married a woman who he got knocked up a little over 4 years ago. Their relationship is ... an interesting story. He met her in high school and shortly before her senior year ended, her family ended up moving away without her. During this time, she stayed in my brother's closet without any of us knowing. Being young and at home all the time, I figured it out and even found her in the closet one day. She wasn't the best girl ever either. Her family moved away from her ... with reason. She was difficult to control, she was manipulative, she was harmful and insulting to her gay brother, and she was a teenager who thought my brother would take care of her. They ended up eloping without our knowledge because he got her pregnant. She had her baby and they decided that they were going to stay in Alabama with her grandparents while they would try and find a place to live down there.

That Christmas changed everything. We had received a call from them saying they were coming to visit for Christmas. I was happy, I hadn't met my nephew yet and it would be a nice time at Christmas for us to seem like a family. They came in a blue van with all their stuff packed inside. They said they were only staying a couple days ... which turned into over 4 years today. My parents obliged at first because they wanted to be involved in their grandson's life and they figured it would help my brother find his way without him having to worry about rent or other expenses. My brother claimed they left Alabama because it was too ""racist"" for him (I'm Asian) and that everyone would make fun of him. Later, from talking the grandparents we found out that they had just kicked them out because they were planning on staying there the same way they tricked my parents.

It started off alright. They moved in my brother's old bedroom. It only had a bunkbed but we figured they were only staying a couple weeks at the most. I was glad there would be other people in the house to help my parents while I started my first year of college and I felt that our family could start to include my brother and his wife again. It didn't get better. My brother and mother would have constant fights over the state of the house, over what his wife would or wouldn't do, over how my brother never helped with common household chores, over how much they would spend, over how they weren't saving for a house of their own, etc. It got better for awhile when my mom stopped buying so many groceries because she was sick of having them eat everything in the house. They bought their own food and it seemed like everyone was just staying out of everyone's way for once.

I moved back into my parent's house after my second year at college to help them around the house and to continue school up there for awhile. I saw what they were doing to my parents. I felt so sad for them. My mom was always stressed and upset but couldn't see how she could do anything about it. My dad was always tired from working late at nights and then having to deal with things in the house my brother refused to do (mow the grass, take out the trash, clean anything in general, etc). I helped out the best I could while I saw my brother yell at them, buy things he didn't need, continue to leave messes, and to disregard how accomodating my parents were being to them. My brother and his wife were just rude. They constantly nagged my parents to buy them more food, to buy things for their child. They insulted my brother (who lived on his own and worked hard to pay for everything he owned). The worst part was that no one understood my family's situation. I would bring over friends and they seemed like they were nothing but nice to them. They were so manipulative to strangers. They were so manipulative to everybody. My parents fell into their traps about how they'd find a house soon, how they were saving money (even though they ate out all the time, bought new expensive toys for their child, and bought over 1000 movies that fill up their entire room). My dad especially couldn't bring himself to kick his son out or to ruin a relationship with their only grandson. They were stuck in this situation where they wanted to keep a family together but the family was so self-destructive.

Fast forward to 2 years ago, our older brother was getting married. He invited all of his family to his wedding. Everyone was excited. His wife would tell me about the dress she'd bought for the wedding. Then out of nowhere, my brother tells my parents that he and his wife were not going to the wedding. This is where things exploded. My mom and dad were angry that my brother chose to not go to his own brother's wedding. Why did my brother decide not to go? He told us that it was because we ""didn't support their marriage."" The marriage in which they eloped somewhere and told no one. He screamed and cried at my mom, telling her that they never supported him, they never supported his wife, etc. My parents, the people who gave them shelter, somehow did not support my brother.

This isn't the whole story. It's a flash of only the worst things they've done. I moved back to my college city to continue school and I get calls all the time from my mom who gets more upset day after day. They've tried talking to them, it just doesn't work. My brother will either cry about how they're not supporting him or bring up past events where he felt like he was left out (speaking of which, I've invited them to every family function we've had, they choose not to go because his wife is ""scared of the city"" or just because they refuse to do any family activities with us). I come home every once in awhile to hear that his wife has stolen family heirlooms, broken things in the house, won't control her child, etc. Today, I got probably the worst call from my mom. My brother's wife is friends with our neighbors and frequently talks to them about her daily life (which is sitting at home in my brother's old bunkbed room because she doesn't have a driver's license or a job). My neighbor comes up to my mom and dad to say hello and asks if my brother's wife has given birth yet. BIRTH. TO ANOTHER BABY. THAT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD MY PARENTS ABOUT. Apparently it's due in September and they still, after 4 years, haven't found a place to live and there's no way my brother's old bedroom is big enough for 4 people. The worst was that through all this, not even one thank you was given. No thanks for the house my parents graciously let them stay in, the food the provided them with, or the overall niceness of letting people live in their house for 4 years.

So, I guess what I'm asking is - what do I do? How do you handle something like this? It's getting to the point where I think my mom might snap and I don't want anything to happen to her. By this point, I could care less what happens to my brother or his wife. That sounds selfish, that sounds rude but there's no way to truly explain the pain they've caused in my family. We're out of options. We're definitely past talking to them. I'm not sure what to do. I get so upset when my mom calls to tell me what they've done that week. I just feel so bad for my parents. They're such good people for taking them in and they deserve so much better than all of this. They're scared to lose their son to whatever may happen but he's put a strain so much on their relationship, that it doesn't even matter anymore. They just need to move out. My parents refuse to give up their house just for my brother but they're not seeing any other option than to sell the house and force my brother to move out. It's definitely a last resort.

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, so if thats you, this post likely isn't very relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I know now a day there is a stigma that going straight to university after college is the right thing to do if you want to be successful and get a good job, and I want to say that its simply not true at all.** 

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago I was in a position like many of you are right now finishing high school and not having a lot of guidance or idea of what I really wanted or what I really needed other than the fact my mother told me ""You can go to college and live at home, or you can not go to college and get kicked out, it's up to you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That said I was no more than a 2.7GPA in high school and a 2.99GPA finishing off college so I am by no means a top of my class student in any realm, in fact I think that puts me basically at the bottom, basically a C average student at best, even though I felt I really tried (attending multiple hours of after school tutoring sessions, etc.. nothing really clicked), I scored an 18 on my ACT (well below the a good score) and was told to basically stay away from anything STEM related. So I can say with confidence that there are people in a lot better situations (and those in less than or equal to as well) in terms of finances, scholarships, and college advice, and I want to hopefully even help just ONE person with this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, its geared towards someone who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, or even someone who just cannot outright afford university whether it be because their family isn't contributing or they don't get any financial aid, or they don't have any scholarships in general. **These are all very real scenarios that the majority of people run into all the time, and it can be crippling to your future if not handled correctly.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to provide some resources and advise for anyone who is considering taking college loans out SHOULD at least consider and review. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who still have have 1+ years of high school**

**PLEASE** consider dual enrollment classes, a lot of high schools are offering them now a day, I was able to graduate high school with 47 college credits by simply doing college courses over high school courses (and believe it or not I found them much easier to do, I attended a free ""college prep"" ""private"" high school) and found my classes extremely challenging, so instead I started taking most of my classes at community college through my high school for literally 10$/credit. I realize not all high schools have this option, but if you do, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take advantage of it. This is an easy and cheap way to get general electives out of the way for college, and finishing high school at the same time, and it quite literally made high school easier for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who don't know what they want to major in**

This happens ALL THE TIME, people have no idea what they want to do, so they just attend a university as undeclared or as some random major that they end up switching 5 times in two years, if this is you, GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, because all you're going to be doing is general electives and classes at your full university for 5x the price. You can do all of this, at community college, probably live at home, work a part time job, and really think about what you want to do before making any major decisions. It truly makes sense. 

(**THE ABOVE ADVICE WORKS THE SAME WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING GENERAL ELECTIVES FOR THE MOST PART OF YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNIVERSITY, JUST DO THEM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE)**

&amp;#x200B;

**- DON'T FEEL PRESSURED INTO GOING TO UNIVERSITY**

I have seen this so many times people feel absolutely left out that all their friends are leaving for some university, and they don't want to be the odd man out who doesn't end up going.  DON'T let your emotions get the best of you, this isn't about your friends, or your high school reputation (that no one cares about) this is about you and your financial future, don't get confused why you're going to college. 

Don't get yourself in debt for the sake of feelings, don't worry about anyone else but yourself. Odds are you're not going to know anyone that you went to high school with 3 months after you start college. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Don't go to community college or university: TRADE SCHOOL**

For some people they feel as though they have no other option, this is simply untrue, trade schools exist for a reason, they're cheap and teach you a skill that can be used in the real world. I was on the fence on going to college simply because I absolutely did NOT like school, and my grades really showed that, but I did have a passion for the subject that I wanted to learn so I decided i'd like it better than the other options for trade school. But trade schools are by no means a bad thing at all. They exist for a reason. If you're going to go to college and get a learn a bunch of stuff that you don't like, you might as well just go learn a trade that you don't like for a fraction of the price and end up without crippling debt and a job! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- RESEARCH YOUR JOB PROSPECTS**

While college and higher education is there to continue your studies on a defined topic of your choice, if you're going into it with no money you MUST look at your job prospects, though I hate to say that you shouldn't go to college with the sole purpose of getting a fancy job, you should at least consider the opportunities you have after college in your field once you finish college. 

Unfortunately we're at a place where we have to treat college as an investment rather than a place to go learn regardless of the outcome, if you have all the money in the world and want to go study some weird obscure topic that has zero job possibility, thats totally fine. But this post is geared towards those who must treat college as an investment and NOT a luxury. 

High education will always be there, you can always go back, but you can't ever undo your college debt once you've signed for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- DO. THE. MATH.  LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOUR OPTIONS**

CONSIDER all your options in every university you can, look at all the data. Everyone wants to go to the school with the best program so they can get the best education, but the reality of the situation is,  its not at all feasible.  Unless you're getting financial aid and scholarships, its best just to choose the cheapest option, seriously. What you put into your education is what you'll get out of it.

We're at a time where we have everything available to us with a single google search. If you want to get the education of an MIT computer science student, you can do that, most of their lectures are posted on YouTube for FREE. THATS A FREE MIT EDUCATION, apply that with your normal classes at your University and you'll be a rockstar. Most companies want COMPETENT employees not fancy degrees. If you can prove your competencies and expertise on a subject in a job interview while someone with a harvard law degree cannot, they'll choose you any day of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**- REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE**

SO MANY COLLEGES offer all these fancy dorms, gyms, campus coffee bars, etc. It looks awesome, living the american dream! But YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. That stuff doesn't come cheap and schools pass that cost right down to you. Don't fall victim to it, go to school for your education, not the fancy features that they give you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 As someone who finished school with $20,000 in student loans, there are people who come out with 10x that who will never pay it off, people who will live pay check to pay check for the rest of their lives, don't do that to yourself. 

Be smart, be objective, do your own research. Don't feel pressured, don't be persuaded, do whats best for YOU. 

I know its hard when you're young and you don't think it'll be that big of a deal, and you'll be able to handle it. Even if that is the case, don't put yourself through that stress, its seriously unhealthy. 

No ones going to spoon feed you this information if they haven't already. You have to be ready to make your own decisions that'll affect you for the rest of your life. Do the research that it requires.

4 years ago I was in a position like many of you are right now finishing high school and not having a lot of guidance or idea of what I really wanted or what I really needed other than the fact my mother told me ""You can go to college and live at home, or you can not go to college and get kicked out, it's up to you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That said I was no more than a 2.7GPA in high school and a 2.99GPA finishing off college so I am by no means a top of my class student in any realm, in fact I think that puts me basically at the bottom, basically a C average student at best, even though I felt I really tried (attending multiple hours of after school tutoring sessions, etc.. nothing really clicked), I scored an 18 on my ACT (well below the a good score) and was told to basically stay away from anything STEM related. So I can say with confidence that there are people in a lot better situations (and those in less than or equal to as well) in terms of finances, scholarships, and college advice, and I want to hopefully even help just ONE person with this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, its geared towards someone who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, or even someone who just cannot outright afford university whether it be because their family isn't contributing or they don't get any financial aid, or they don't have any scholarships in general. **These are all very real scenarios that the majority of people run into all the time, and it can be crippling to your future if not handled correctly.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to provide some resources and advise for anyone who is considering taking college loans out SHOULD at least consider and review. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who still have have 1+ years of high school**

**PLEASE** consider dual enrollment classes, a lot of high schools are offering them now a day, I was able to graduate high school with 47 college credits by simply doing college courses over high school courses (and believe it or not I found them much easier to do, I attended a free ""college prep"" ""private"" high school) and found my classes extremely challenging, so instead I started taking most of my classes at community college through my high school for literally 10$/credit. I realize not all high schools have this option, but if you do, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take advantage of it. This is an easy and cheap way to get general electives out of the way for college, and finishing high school at the same time, and it quite literally made high school easier for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who don't know what they want to major in**

This happens ALL THE TIME, people have no idea what they want to do, so they just attend a university as undeclared or as some random major that they end up switching 5 times in two years, if this is you, GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, because all you're going to be doing is general electives and classes at your full university for 5x the price. You can do all of this, at community college, probably live at home, work a part time job, and really think about what you want to do before making any major decisions. It truly makes sense. 

(**THE ABOVE ADVICE WORKS THE SAME WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING GENERAL ELECTIVES FOR THE MOST PART OF YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNIVERSITY, JUST DO THEM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE)**

&amp;#x200B;

**- DON'T FEEL PRESSURED INTO GOING TO UNIVERSITY**

I have seen this so many times people feel absolutely left out that all their friends are leaving for some university, and they don't want to be the odd man out who doesn't end up going.  DON'T let your emotions get the best of you, this isn't about your friends, or your high school reputation (that no one cares about) this is about you and your financial future, don't get confused why you're going to college. 

Don't get yourself in debt for the sake of feelings, don't worry about anyone else but yourself. Odds are you're not going to know anyone that you went to high school with 3 months after you start college. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Don't go to community college or university: TRADE SCHOOL**

For some people they feel as though they have no other option, this is simply untrue, trade schools exist for a reason, they're cheap and teach you a skill that can be used in the real world. I was on the fence on going to college simply because I absolutely did NOT like school, and my grades really showed that, but I did have a passion for the subject that I wanted to learn so I decided i'd like it better than the other options for trade school. But trade schools are by no means a bad thing at all. They exist for a reason. If you're going to go to college and get a learn a bunch of stuff that you don't like, you might as well just go learn a trade that you don't like for a fraction of the price and end up without crippling debt and a job! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- RESEARCH YOUR JOB PROSPECTS**

While college and higher education is there to continue your studies on a defined topic of your choice, if you're going into it with no money you MUST look at your job prospects, though I hate to say that you shouldn't go to college with the sole purpose of getting a fancy job, you should at least consider the opportunities you have after college in your field once you finish college. 

Unfortunately we're at a place where we have to treat college as an investment rather than a place to go learn regardless of the outcome, if you have all the money in the world and want to go study some weird obscure topic that has zero job possibility, thats totally fine. But this post is geared towards those who must treat college as an investment and NOT a luxury. 

High education will always be there, you can always go back, but you can't ever undo your college debt once you've signed for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- DO. THE. MATH.  LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOUR OPTIONS**

CONSIDER all your options in every university you can, look at all the data. Everyone wants to go to the school with the best program so they can get the best education, but the reality of the situation is,  its not at all feasible.  Unless you're getting financial aid and scholarships, its best just to choose the cheapest option, seriously. What you put into your education is what you'll get out of it.

We're at a time where we have everything available to us with a single google search. If you want to get the education of an MIT computer science student, you can do that, most of their lectures are posted on YouTube for FREE. THATS A FREE MIT EDUCATION, apply that with your normal classes at your University and you'll be a rockstar. Most companies want COMPETENT employees not fancy degrees. If you can prove your competencies and expertise on a subject in a job interview while someone with a harvard law degree cannot, they'll choose you any day of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**- REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE**

SO MANY COLLEGES offer all these fancy dorms, gyms, campus coffee bars, etc. It looks awesome, living the american dream! But YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. That stuff doesn't come cheap and schools pass that cost right down to you. Don't fall victim to it, go to school for your education, not the fancy features that they give you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 As someone who finished school with $20,000 in student loans, there are people who come out with 10x that who will never pay it off, people who will live pay check to pay check for the rest of their lives, don't do that to yourself. 

Be smart, be objective, do your own research. Don't feel pressured, don't be persuaded, do whats best for YOU. 

I know its hard when you're young and you don't think it'll be that big of a deal, and you'll be able to handle it. Even if that is the case, don't put yourself through that stress, its seriously unhealthy. 

No ones going to spoon feed you this information if they haven't already. You have to be ready to make your own decisions that'll affect you for the rest of your life. Do the research that it requires.

&amp;#x200B;

okayshark,1647359489,/r/college/comments/tes33g/physics_biology_dilemma_on_whether_i_should/,"TLDR is at the bottom as well as my questions. This turned out very long, I apologize.

To start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting.

So it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge.

In high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time.

But ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load.

Now, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me.

As for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week.

When I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff.. Still right now that aspect of ""woah that's so cool"" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics.

I suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense.

So that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics.

The thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable.

I will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that)

The direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like ""heh i can't wait to learn more about this"". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed.  
I still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!!!!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so.

TLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though.

Question to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change?  
Also: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road?

[deleted],1321906609,/r/AskReddit/comments/mkiqi/terrible_roommates_worst_experience/,"Hey Reddit.
I actually made this post, partly to get my own story of my chest. It's not that bad compared to what others go through i'm sure! But i'm still affected by this one experience i had with a girl, who rented out a room in her parent bought apartment. Important note, i was and still am suffering from a depression, so yeah, i'm not the easiest person to live with. But she made me worse, and made feel like i was nothing but a terrible, thoughtless, heartless and lazy cynical human being. 

I met her at this 6month stay at a course thingy (hard to explain, not important) Never really got to know her, she didn't seem my type. But so after this ended, i was planning on moving away from home, my first time and everything. She had a room in her flat, that she needed to rent out, otherwise it'd be too expensive. So by a coincidence we found each other, and i had a room. 

It seemed fine at first, i had school the first couple of months i followed, but eventually i dropped out. I couldn't handle it, couldn't handle most things, and was trying to get into some kind of therapy (took a year before i got any) From the time i moved in and until things got really bad between us, she thought of me living there, as a constant friend she could do stuff with, and talk to whenever she felt like it. Like a social bunny really.
It was fine for a while, but eventually stressed me out. I felt like i didn't have any space of my own, and that i was slowly being consumed by this ""friendship"" thing she had going on.. it started to look and feel like a friggin relationship.
As a depressed person, i couldn't overcome anything, it was kept at an absolute minimum. My energy was close to non existant, so taking up her way of behaving with me, was just a little too much. I just decided to let it slide, and hoped it would pass.
It just got worse though, she was a cleaning maniac on top of everything. So when i finally did use the kitchen, i cleared every last bit of evidence of me being there, otherwise she would hassel me the very next morning for not having removed cleaned dishes or whatever. Dealing with her, was more stressfull than just sweaping away evidence. She also liked to hover behind me, talking, looking at what i did whilst making myself something to eat or whatever. Always a little judgmental, me making some sort eatable shit that i could survieve on, while she always made all sorts of amazing dinners every night. I did on occassion get the subtle you're-so-unhealthy-and-also-you-drink-too-much-coffee, i mean cmon.. like i wasn't aware of this already.

From the start she knew how bad i was, and that i was trying to get help etc. I had told her alot about myself, trying to make her understand my situation a little better (always difficult with people, who has never been or been close to someone who was depressed)
She never understood it.

I got a boyfriend (over an mmo :P) It was longdistance, but fantastic otherwise. With him i felt human, and like i could cope with things better. I felt less like an ill person, and could put it behind me easier. Usually i would go to see him, since he lived in a bigger place and it was nicer there. 
Meanwhile my roommate had changed job, and she had been diagnosed with gluten allergy, which hit her hard, having to change her diet and stuff. The work part wasn't going very well either. She always stroke me as a person who had difficulties socially, and i figured that was why she was so focused and hung up on me.
My friends started asking about him, and so did the roommate. The roommate was all, oh you can bring him here, that's fine, and he can stay as long as you two want blabla.  
So eventually i had him over, throughly discussing with her for long it would be okay, having him there aswell. We decided 3 weeks, i though it was long, but hey, she agreed on it, and i would get to be with my bf for 3 bloody weeks. I didn't argue.

So he came over, had time to ourselves and my roommate finally left me alone, i loved it. During the time he was there, the course thingy we had gone to earlier, did this reunion thing. I did say i would be going, but same evening.. eh.. yeah me and my bf decided and empty flat should be taken advantage of instead. So my roommate had a friend over, who had also attended the course, and they were going together. She kept knocking on my door asking when i was going, and if we should go together etc. i just postponing it, saying i'd come later and stuff. I did the same to my friends going to the party aswell. 
I never showed, but got some calls from friends, they understood my choice completely :P The roommate however didn't, she first wanted to talk to me on the phone, when i explained her why and what i was doing, what i was doing, she just went: oh, and hung up. Then continued to ignore me completely for 3 days after that. 
Some time later, still while my bf was there, she had that friend over again. So i was standing in the kitchen making some tea or whatever, and she started asking me questions, about my depression, and telling her friend who was standing next to her, how i wasn't doing anything at the moment, talked about some very personal stuff, i had shared with her, as i said above, in order to make her understand a little. 
I was both confused, furious and i felt very ashamed.
Not long after that, she wanted to have a serious talk with me. About how she felt it was unfair that she had to work everyday and come home to me, who wasn't doing anything, and she would like if i could atleast be a little more active. I never understood what she meant. But i was crushed, and cried. Truely felt lousy, useless and inconvenient.
Up untill a very few days before my bf was going back home, she had been ignoring him, never said a word to him. Unless he had said hey to her, she would mutter a hey back. He just generally stayed out of shared space in flat, to avoid those awkward moments with her.

After he left, she came and asked for 70 quid, for him staying. She felt that would cover his expenses for heat and water. I got furious with her.
I told her to fuck off basically, refused to pay her. She continued to try and get that money, i continued to refuse, unless she could come up with legitimate proof of him having cost that much extra. She obviously couldn't, especially since all costs of the flat were determined, and wouldn't change from month to month. 

Eventually she said she thought it would be best if i moved out, she felt we had lost a connection between each other, and that we hadn't really spoken much for the past month (no shit sherlock, i had my boyfriend on visit) I said, i agreed. After that i got a months notice, and i completely ignored her, and didn't do my chores, because i felt like i finally didn't have to give a shit about her anymore. At this point i was sick and tired of her, and i was very very bad. She flipped because of this, and i finally had to take the confrontation with her, that led to her fleeing her own apartment, and never showed until i had moved out. And no i didn't use any violence or threats, i just told her how i felt about her, and how i had felt for the past 6 months, and that i was fucking happy about never having to see her face again.

So yeah, that's my story. I know i was a bitch too, i do know that. But since that time, i've been afraid of living with anyone i know, even the slightest, i even have issues living with complete strangers. I get stressed when they're around, wondering if they're expecting anything of me, wondering if i'm doing anything wrong, afraid of sleeping in during weekends or days where i don't have school, affraid they might think i'm a lazy piece of shit really. 
She just complicated stuff a lot.

After that i did find a new place to live, a private owned dorm room, where the owner eventually ran off with all our money, and i'm currently waiting on the lawyers who run the whole case, to sort out the place, so i can atleast get my deposit back.

All in all, i don't have great housing experiences. Will change hopefully.
I'm sorry this is long, and i kinda expect noone to read it. Just feels really good to get out of my system, sadly reddit you have been chosen to load off place.

Anyway, give your stories! 

Edit: Fuck i'm sorry it's that long!

daughterneedshelp,1346371444,/r/AskReddit/comments/z3v7c/how_can_i_help_my_dad_in_his_custody_battle/,"I am 25 years old and I was raised by an amazing man. My mom and my dad split when I was very young and had shared custody for my whole child life. When I was around 18 he met a woman (much younger than him), fell in love and married her. I never really cared for her too much but he seemed happy and that was all that mattered to me. They had 2 children together, a boy and a girl, who are now 4 and 6 years old. 

Unfortunately, their marriage didn't work and they separated a couple of years back. She wasn't really in the picture that much when they were very little. My dad was always the parent on the front lines and she was kind of background. They separated on fairly good terms (though she had done some awful things that I'm not sure I would have forgiven her for, but he did) and because of this, they came up with a separation agreement together rather than going to court. It was very formal and written in what I would call legal mumbo jumbo, they both signed it and had it notarized. The agreement was many pages long and had a ton of little sub sections, but most importantly stated that his home would remain the primary residence for the children. This agreement has been in place for a couple years now with no issues. 

A few weeks ago she picked up the kids to take them to her house for what my dad thought would be a regular visit. She had just moved out of her moms house into a new place of her own with her new boyfriend. All of a sudden she stopped answering phone calls, text messages and stopped all communication. Because she had just moved, he had no clue where her new address was. He tried and tried to get a hold of her but wasn't able to. Finally she emailed him saying that she was going to be keeping the kids as she didn't believe they were safe at his home anymore. My dad is a recovering alcoholic. He has 42 years sober and is a huge part of a twelve step community. He runs a recovery center on his property. One that was started when they were married and while she lived there as well. One of the main reasons he started this was because he wanted to be a stay at home dad and be as much of a part of the kids lives as he could. There have never been any incidents with the kids at the house and they have there their whole lives.

Her mom has retained a very expensive lawyer for her and they are saying now that because there are drug addicts and alcoholics in the recovery center the children are not safe.

In the documents he was served it said that she wanted primary residence and that the children should not be allowed overnight stays at his home because it is not safe for them. 

A court date was set for sept 14th. and I wish that was where the story ended. 

After the email, she finally agreed to meet with him at a Cracker Barrel so that he could see the kids. My dad decided that when he went that he was going to take the kids home with him. Until the court date he still has primary residence as that is the agreement that is still in effect. Because he was worried that she would be upset when he took them with him, he called the police department and talked with a sheriff and asked if they could come to the parking lot to make sure it all went smoothly. The sheriff told him that, unfortunately, they couldn't come out unless something was actually happening so if something escalated, then to call them and they would be right over. 

My dad went to dinner with them and everything went very calmly. When they were getting ready to go my dad was walking out holding the kids hands and when he got outside he started walking towards his car, and told her the kids were going to go back home with him. She started yelling and came running at him as he was putting the kids in the car. He turned his back to her so she couldn't get by and proceeded to buckle his daughter in. She ran to the other side and pulled her son out of the car. He walked over picked him up and put him back in and drove home. All together he felt it went pretty smoothly. 

For months now he has had a vacation to the beach planned with a house already payed for and reserved this week and so he followed the regular plan and took them on their summer vacation before school starts. me and my family went too (my husband and my 2 kids). Everything was going great, all the kids having a blast. Then suddenly he got a message from her saying she had a court order saying that he had to bring the kids home. He didn't really understand how that could be as the hearing wasn't for a couple weeks, but he got in the car with the kids and we all left the beach 4 days early. When we got back he got a fax of and emergency injunction she had filed stating she was in fear of hers and the kids lives. Apparently she had also filed assault charges on him for the night at cracker barrel. She said he took the kids and pushed her leaving a bruise on her inner arm. Her lawyer filed the paperwork in a ton of different districts, which we are not exactly sure why. She also filed for a protective order which was denied. Today I went with him and met her at a police station to turn over the kids to her. My sister cried and said she didn't want to go to mommy's and held on, and my brother said he liked mommy's better because she lets him play World of Warcraft (remember he is 6), and because she buys him stuff when he asks and he doesn't have to do anything to get it. My dad sobbed in the parking lot. He is crushed.

My whole childhood I have never seen my dad be anywhere close to violent. My worst punishment I ever received was a 3 minute timeout (which I got a lot and hated every minute of) but never even one spanking. He is an amazing and dedicated father and I know I could find a hundred people that would speak to that and for all the lives he has touched and even saved in his years in the program. 

Here is where the problem comes in. He does not have the money for a lawyer and we are going to have to do this on our own. He doesn't qualify for free legal service as his income is too high, but he also doesn't have a savings or a way to pay the high retainers the lawyers we have spoken to are asking.

I'm not asking for a handout. I want to know how we can do this by ourselves if it is even possible to stand against her 100k lawyer on our own knowing that they could probably crush us with paperwork. And if it is what to do. We went to cracker barrel today and found out that they do have video surveillance of where everything happened which is awesome cause that will with out a doubt prove that he didn't assault her at all. They said that they can't give it to us, it has to be given to a police officer or be subpoenaed. Can  something be subpoenaed without a lawyer??? 

One of the other issues that we are facing right now is that they were enrolled at a montessori school set to start next Tuesday. (this is an amazing award winning school that my dad had to pull a million strings to get them into) and apparently she has decided it is to long of a drive for her so she enrolled them in the regular public school in her area. 

My dad doesn't want to wait until the hearing in september because it is going to mess with their school. We went to the circuit court today and spoke with a very nice lady who gave us a form called a praecipe that I guess allows us to request to to be heard in front of the judge regarding the emergency injunction. Can we do this on our own? My dad says if we go without a lawyer that her lawyer may not even let him get a word in. I guess I just don't see any other option.... 

I know this was a lot, and I'm not even entirely sure it all makes sense. I will take any help/advice I can get. I can scan in the documents (and cover all the personal info) we have if that will help at all. And I can answer any questions if I missed something or didnt make sense somewhere. 

Please, I swear on my own kids lives, My dad is amazing and loving and every trait a father should have. Help.

sadSO,1303674525,/r/AskReddit/comments/gwgyo/at_the_breaking_point_with_my_bfi_know_its_long/,"I'm at the end of my rope Reddit! Me(f23) and my BF(M27) have been dating for about 3 years.  We've been through a lot including sickness, being homeless, huge family and financial issues...I love him very dearly.  This may be long so I apologize!

Recently we have been having a lot of problems with (what I feel)is his inability to understand and do normal household things such as cooking, cleaning etc.  These are things that people just do when you live with someone.  He was babied a bit by his mother...she cooked every meal for the family, she made his lunch and his bed...when he lived alone before he dated me he didn't even do his own laundry(he took it all to drycleaning)

He also never cooks(not even eggs or ramen)  if it were up to him he'd order out or go somewhere for every meal...the problem is I love cooking and sometimes want to eat at home, but then that means I will ALWAYS be the one to make the meal and he doesn't even offer to help(he will help when asked)..I feel like if I stay with him I will end up being a housewife making him all of his meals...

We've talked about this a lot and he tells me he'll try avidly...The last big fight we got in about it I asked him ""when was the last time you cooked us a mean?""  ""When was the last time you cleaned the toilet""  All he could say was he didn't like to clean toilets!  I yelled ""NO ONE likes to clean toilets! but they do it because that's part of life""  He suggested getting a maid!  That would be great but it doesn't really fix he problem...I mean what is he going to do hire a chef too?  I know he doesn't like to cook and I know he doesn't really know how to do any of this stuff, but I haven't seen any significant attempts...I literally feel like his mother sometimes.

To make matters worse, he is probably 90% of my financial support(including school) so I often feel obligated to show my gratitude through housework...I don't like to accept his help too greatly, but I do appreciate and love not having to worry about expenses.  I did expect to see SOME help with housework however since I am close to graduation and plan to start my career...where I would be busy and have an income which would make me feel more of an equal to him.  I finally was sick of it and I now make him do his own laundry...the house is also a mess because I've given up on trying to make it look tidy.

These problems have really gotten bad recently which was after a huge hurdle for our relationship where he and my family did not get along due to financial problems...I was basically stuck in the crossfire...the issues are still not resolved completely and it was very taxing on me mentally.  So our relationship was already very rocky...

Oh I'm just getting started...go get a snack or something

So as I mentioned, I'm very close(like weeks) from graduation and it's very stressful for me...he is also at a very important time in his life...he is the founder of a startup....I think they'll do great things though it's difficult for me to understand the magnitude.  

In the last month or two he has been VERY busy...I mean super busy...lately he barely comes home to sleep in our bed.  Apparently the work he does is much better suited for after work hours(since they are dealing with several locations and need people to be out of the way) so he will work throughout the night. I really don;t like this, but I know sometimes it's unavoidable, but what really gets me is his communication...He will tell me he will come home at a certain time, and doesn't...when I try to text or call I may or may not get a response...he says service is bad or he's busy and can't be bothered etc.  Sometimes I just want to talk for 5 minutes though and see if he is actually coming home that night!

This is so frustrating especially when he'll answer a text and then I'll ask him something else right away and then I won't get a response for three hours...or I'll try to call him because talking is more efficient than text and in response he will text me instead of answer or calling me back. 

We've had numerous discussions about this and often times it ends in him realizing that what he did was wrong and him saying ""I will try to work on this/I will try very hard to fix this) though I've yet to see a big improvement...The other night I really wanted to spend some time with him and got a couple of hours hanging out...he said he had to take his friend out for drinks later(he had just broken up with his SO and they were trying to cheer him up) I was fine with that...though later that night I realized he meant go out drinking late(like 11pm) I voiced I wasn't happy about this...later the drinking plan turned into ""well we might drink a lot and he might get wasted so I might just stay at his place""  I was very upset...I told him to at least come home before 5 or 6am(like before the sun came up)  

So I woke up and he's not there...at 7am he slips into bed, but he's snoring so loud and Im so upset I kick him out to the couch so I can finish sleeping...he later says he was home earlier but he was so drunk he couldn't sleep...he also says he was in and out of the house at starbucks etc which I don't really believe.

I don't because he often says one thing and does another and does not follow through at all...there is a package sitting on our floor that is a christmas gift to his mom that he has yet to send out and I refuse to because I want him to man up and send his own package out...also I am promised a lot of gifts(which I don't really care about) or trips or time alone and I never receive any of them and if I do it is well beyond the time in which they were promised.  He even told me he had hired a chef once for an in home couples cooking class...yea that never happend..though I waited in expectation.  I constantly worry about my tuition and rent because he handles them but the payments are often late and I am the primary lease holder...He also handles our therapy appointments...and even though we've been fighting very badly for months, we have not seen our therapist because my BF can not lock down a date and time(I had to eventually in tears make the appointment) I feel I cannot make the appointment because the therapist is very expensive and I am not the one paying for him...we had an appointment scheduled, but my BF did not confirm it...instead he went with his new employee to a baseball game...

He says he is so busy now, but they are in the middle of trying to hire a new guy to take a lot of the work off of his shoulders...I try to explain that he is causing even more problems by shafting me, but he doesn't see it that way.  I'm so stressed I feel I can't get any work done and I'm afraid of failing and not graduating...I really need his support, but it's hard to get it when he doesn't even come home at night.

Today he was supposed to come home (either last night or very early this morning) to go to easter brunch with me because I knew he had to work in the afternoon...he came here about 10am because he was going through a pile of resumes...and tried to act as if he thought I'd just be waking up even though we discussed the last night he should get here early...I was upset and told him to leave.  When I tried to reason with him that he should not work because it was Easter Sunday and I need and and wanted time with him he basically was like that's just the way it works...

He has told me this is the biggest thing that has happened to him and that he is working hard for ""us"" and that he loves me very much...but the work just has to be done...in my opinion he shouldn't sacrifice the sanity of our already crumbling relationship for a future that might not even happen now...I want to support him and his work, but the situation has made me despise his work and I have no support left for him...

We had a very mean text conversation where he basically kept telling me to at least go to our therapy appointment tomorrow(which I scheduled, but at this point I think I might just end it and deal with the stress, graduation and financial repercussions by myself.....I feel like there are still so many details, but I've already written so much!

I'm not sure what to do any more! :(  sad and lonely on Easter Sunday.  Sorry for the epic post

[deleted],1330726470,/r/AskReddit/comments/qf2ks/please_someone_help_me_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"This is going to be a very, very long story. There'll be a tl;dr at the end, but I'm not sure it'll do it justice So let's start at the beginning

Plain and simple, my extended family on my dad's side are some of the most despicable people I know, specifically my aunt who has been nothing but a cunt to my mom and has treated her like shit from day one. My dad is the youngest of four brothers and they don't really give a crap about him. They're all immigrants and they all do pretty well for themselves. The one exception being my dad who got laid off from his job a while back, tried to start his own business in the middle of the recession, and failed miserably. When my mom and dad went to go ask my uncles for help, my cunt aunt convinced them not to help and they laughed in their faces. That was about 5 years ago and it was the first time I heard my mother cry herself to sleep. It wouldn't be the last either.
Let me explain my mom's side of the family situation now to you as well. My grandfather went to St. Stephen's which is like the Harvard of India. His mother died when he was young and her dying wish was for him to become a teacher. Now when I say Harvard of India, I mean if you graduate from there, you're set for life in India of all goddamn places. I'm talking government positions (which are 10x better than the ones here in terms of benefits), money, connections, etc. He gave up all of it to honor his mother's wish and became an economics professor and eventually became a dean of a small college in India. Now you have to realize that unlike here, being a teacher in India while it gets you a lot of respect, gets you absolutely no money which is what goes for respect in India nowadays. My grandpa got offered numerous positions in the UN but he refused to leave my mother and her sisters. This man is my role model and I wish I was closer to him. Unfortunately he has mild dementia and a few strokes have basically ruined his mind.

My other grandfather was a high official in the Indian Bank. He died way before I was born but my grandmother was one of the best people I knew. She died about 12 years ago but I remember her fondly. Yet, my uncles pretty much taint any memory of her. All I can think of is, where did she go so terribly wrong? How did she raise such assholes? Getting back to the story, my grandfather was extremely successful and high up in the bank and got my first 2 uncles married before he died. His family is extremely rich too.

Fast forward to shortly before my parent's wedding. My mom meets my aunts and uncles for the first time (arranged marriage with a few dates) and she tells me that when she was left alone with the cunt, she would make these weird faces at her. I've seen her do it to my mom so that's how I know this is all true. Then when everyone came back, the cunt went back to being a sweet, goody two shoes (yep, she's one of those people).
During the wedding, she somehow convinced my grandmother that my mom had tried to make my cousin who was 6 at the time, carry a large suitcase. My mom said my grandma yelled bloody murder at her which took me aback because like I said, this was the sweetest woman in the world from what I remember.
Now going back to my maternal grandparents. My dad's family doesn't give them any respect because my grandfather isn't rich. My oldest uncle has made a lot of snarky remarks regarding the fact that they don't have much money. One of my dad's cousins kicked my grandpa out when he went to go pay his respects (A thing in India when the poor go to the rich). This is going to be ironic soon enough

Fast-forward to 1996, I'm about 3 years old and my cousins come up to visit (they live in the south, I'm from the Northeast). One of my uncle's (married to the cunt) wants White Castle so my mom being the nice person she is, goes and gets a shitload of white castle. Then in front of everyone, the cunt tells people that my mom has a crush on my uncle. In front of my father. Her children laugh it up and so do my other uncle's kids (they live right next to each other). My mom told me she went to bed sobbing uncontrollably because of that incident.
It's 2007 now. My dad's business is failing and he's in a depressed spell. My mom calls my uncle's house and the cunt picks up. She toys with my mom until she's crying to put my uncle on the phone (cunt uncle and oldest uncle are both doctors). Cunt uncle manages to talk some sense into my dad but this segways into asking help at the wedding.

Ive been silent about the 3rd uncle, because he's perhaps the worst of all. We'll call him asshole. In 2009, Cunt uncle and Oldest Uncle and family went to India for the umpteenth time (my mom and dad cant afford to go. i havent been in 10 years) and my mom asks them to bring back a few bottles of hair care product you can only get in India. I'm talking like hotel sized bottles of shampoo. Instead of bringing it back (about 40 bags between all of them) they ship it via fucking fed-ex. from india. holy shit I thought my mom was gonna kill herself. She flipped out on them, didn't get out of bed for 3 weeks, I didn't speak to my dad because at this point, I was so disappointed in him for not standing up for my mom. During one of my sulking periods, my mom got out of bed and confronted me about it. I was surprised because she's threatened to leave him over this bullshit multiple times. I asked why he doesn't stand up and she said it was because of Asshole Uncle. The reason my dad came to America is because he went to work for my uncle who treated him SO BAD that he decided he couldn't be in the GODDAMN COUNTRY ANYMORE. I literally cannot stress that enough. He uprooted his entire life and moved halfway across the world just because he couldn't take working for that thundercunt one more day. My grandma begged and pleaded but it was that bad. Ironically. asshole's wife who's a lazy piece of shit who also starts shit with my mom is on the receiving end of Cunt's attacks also. It's a fucking Mexican standoff everywhere.

So why aren't we not not speaking? Well quite frankly, I think it has to do with me. See, my cousins aren't the smartest bulbs on the tree, but they'll be fine because their uncles are wealthy. I've worked my ass off and am the first person in the family to get into an Ivy League school. Oh and I hate my cousins too. I'm nice to their banshees of mothers but I know none of them have any respect for mine. They can't even pretend. Part of my motivation is not only to succeed, but to act as a big fuck you to these assholes and show them that my parents were amaizing and just because they were poor and bullyable, doesnt mean you'll fuck with me.
That and the fact that despite ALL OF THIS, this is the only family my dad has left, so my mother, my brother, and I agree to keep going along for his sake. Here's my problem Reddit, my mother and I have agreed to end contact with them once my father dies. Any suggestions on how to go about doing it without looking like it's a side effect of grief or something? I hate these assholes and I want nothing to do with them. Sometimes I think of changing my last name just to avoid association with them, but the thought of my father stops me everytime. Thanks for reading

TL;DR Father's family treats my mom and dad like shit. Mom and I have agreed to keep contact as long as Dad is alive. Once dead, what do we do?

P.S.: Everyone treats me fine to my face. They probably say shit behind my back but i really don't care. I know they're friendly with me because they're going to want something out of me eventually. I'll have to get out of that too....

EDIT: Also, what happens if my father lives to the point where my brother and I are married and have children? How do we walk away from this then?

EDIT 2: These people are manipulative and will stop at nothing. I'm not so worried for me as I am my brother who is sweet and naive and I fear will suffer the same fate as my parents

[deleted],1355852887,/r/AskReddit/comments/1526xu/leaving_everything_i_know_behind_to_escape_an/,"Reddit I need advice. First of all this is a throw away account because ive got some friends and family that know my regular account. Also a warning, this is a pretty long read.


A little background on me and my life. Im from the US. Im a single female in my early twenties. I come from an emotionally abusive family who are too naive to even recognize the kind of damage they do to each other, and especially to me. Ever since my father left us when I was 14 the burden was on me to raise my older sister, because I was the “mature one”. She was the one to go party and cause trouble while I was shy and had a love for education. Its true that I was wise beyond my years but this enabled my mom to take a back seat in raising us, it was just easier to let me worry about everything and for her to ask like a child again. She had the burden of being the sole financial provider and I appreciate her for the immensely, however most of the funds were used to buy my older sister a car, designer clothes and purses, expensive nights out, electronics that she kept braking, all which made my mom broke. I never asked for anything financially, all I just wanted from my parents was attention and love. Though I know they do love me its not true unconditional love, it’s a kind of “if I admit I don’t care ill look bad as a parent” type of love. My dad during this time was inattentive, and barely in the picture. Long story short my parents don’t know an ounce about raising children and have admitted to me that they just had kids because “its just what people do”. 


Fast forward to my high school years. At this point me and my sister aren’t really friends, she has her crowd and i had mine. I started having trouble in school because some things happened between my friends and guidance counselors, with similar occurrences ranging from inappropriate contact to just being assholes telling kids with 90% averages that they could just work after high school (I hung out with the nerds). I stood up for my friends as if it was my own fight and it bitt me in the ass like nothing I’ve ever experienced. Because I spoke out against their inappropriate actions in defense of my friends and encouraged my friends not put up with it the teachers, the administration and the counselors of course lashed out on me (because they were exposed) and i started getting bad marks I didn’t deserve in almost every class. My parents knew of this as I would often come home from school in tears. They chose to do nothing about it and thought id handle it by my 16 year old self. My friends of course didn’t have my back like I did for them and I said the hell with it all my senior year and dropped out. However i continued my love for knowledge and admitted myself into other schools, all this without my parents knowledge. I could leave the house on a completely different schedule, hair style, dress, etc. and they wouldn’t notice, not that my dad was there to notice anyway. Hell they wouldn’t have noticed if I turned into a male in that time. While trying to complete my courses and do well it was simply impossible to do homework at home. They would bother me with everything, even when I begged to be left alone, and mocked me when I worked hard like the nerd that I am. Its funny to think that they didn’t notice anything about me but wouldn’t leave me alone either. It was all about them to the point where they just used me for company and entertainment while ignoring anything I wanted or felt. 



Recently my sisters friends kind of went their different ways and she was stuck with me now, she became attached and it became even less possible to be alone. My parents always talked about us as a pair, introduced us as a pair and thought of us as one entity. I hated that. So when my sister got something, they assumes I did as well meanwhile I continued to be ignored and neglected. During all this time my mom and dad where like teenagers, fighting, and bickering but then being friendly and hooking up, then talking trash about each other. And this they all dumped on me. They wanted me to figure out why my mom was being distant or why my dad was a deadbeat, they wanted me to teach my sister how to be a responsible adult. They simply wanted and made me be the parent. I have a soft heart so I put my life aside for over 4 years to try and be their rock and keep the family together. Without me they would literally act like a wild pack of dogs. If I’m not there to intervene my sister would lash out at my mom, my mom would snap back and then shut down for days. My dad would try to sabotage anything we have going on, etc. I recently found out that they all had pretty fricken huge lies that they kept from me, each different but directly affecting my life. And I told them the destructive impact they have on my life. They didn’t care, after a week it all goes back to normal and they treat me like a parent again. 


So I’ve been planning to get away somehow, I can’t stand to live with them anymore. Here is an example. My mom is jealous of her young daughters, it breaks my heart that she sees us as competition,  she sneaks around and gets treatments done then when I ask her for advice on something like skin care she pretends like doesn’t know anything, like shes o-natural. They both have encouraged me to eat junk before I knew better. If I start looking thinner than my sister she gets herself an eating disorder, literally. If I work hard and achieve something they all become super depressed that they don’t have that or didn’t reach that goal too. Throughout the years of studying, hidden in coffee shops, or libraries, I got my average to an 93% because I want to go to university. They don’t know that because I cant have them take that away from me too. My sister once saw two one my report cards with a 90% and 94% averages and began to be super depressed that she doesn’t have those grades for her to get into school. Its at a point where I sabotage myself, I try not to look too pretty, wear baggy sweaters, have bad posture, say anything intelligent, just so that they don’t feel so bad that im growing and they aren’t, even though I try to help them improve any issue they have with themselves or their situation. I cant live like this any more. If you think im being dramatic, turst me, ive left out many things because it would otherwise turn into a novel. My life's been like having drug addicted unresponsive parents all my life, except i cant blame the drugs for their neglect, just their own lack of education and emotional stability.


When I was 18 I spent a month in the UK on a transfer program. I loved it there. So im now planning to just pack up and leave. I don’t want to stay home for the holidays, it’s the fakest time of the year in our family. Now that the holidays are approaching im getting anxious and I want to go. I have everything packed, I even secretly got a work visa for the UK. I have about $5,000 in the bank and about $4,000 more in savings (money that I managed to hide over the last few years). But it hit me like a ton of bricks today, ill be on my own. I’ve been alone emotionally most my life and being physically alone is not a problem for me but my number one fear is that I’ll spend all I have and in a month or two and will have to come crawling back home. I cant do that. In all honesty I would rather be homeless. Ill be signing up for school this January but even if I get in the academic year would be starting in September 2013. I hope to find work and modest living arraignments for time being. I don’t care if I get a job washing dishes all day or cleaning toilets, as long as I can get by. So if anyone has done something like this, just left your old life behind and started somewhere new with no education and few job experiences, no place to live, no friends or family and succeeded please for the love of god reassure me that ill be ok. Im really scared. ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you for reading and for any advice you might have. I apologize for the typos, if this is in the wrong sub, and also sorry about the rant.

[deleted],1330708265,/r/AskReddit/comments/qenrx/askreddit_my_extended_family_is_emotionally/,"This is going to be a very, very long story. There'll be a tl;dr at the end, but I'm not sure it'll do it justice So let's start at the beginning

Plain and simple, my extended family on my dad's side are some of the most despicable people I know, specifically my aunt who has been nothing but a cunt to my mom and has treated her like shit from day one. My dad is the youngest of four brothers and they don't really give a crap about him. They're all immigrants and they all do pretty well for themselves. The one exception being my dad who got laid off from his job a while back, tried to start his own business in the middle of the recession, and failed miserably. When my mom and dad went to go ask my uncles for help, my cunt aunt convinced them not to help and they laughed in their faces. That was about 5 years ago and it was the first time I heard my mother cry herself to sleep. It wouldn't be the last either. 

Let me explain my mom's side of the family situation now to you as well. My grandfather went to St. Stephen's which is like the Harvard of India. His mother died when he was young and her dying wish was for him to become a teacher. Now when I say Harvard of India, I mean if you graduate from there, you're set for life in India of all goddamn places. I'm talking government positions (which are 10x better than the ones here in terms of benefits), money, connections, etc. He gave up all of it to honor his mother's wish and became an economics professor and eventually became a dean of a small college in India. Now you have to realize that unlike here, being a teacher in India while it gets you a lot of respect, gets you absolutely no money which is what goes for respect in India nowadays. My grandpa got offered numerous positions in the UN but he refused to leave my mother and her sisters. This man is my role model and I wish I was closer to him. Unfortunately he has mild dementia and a few strokes have basically ruined his mind.

My other grandfather was a high official in the Indian Bank. He died way before I was born but my grandmother was one of the best people I knew. She died about 12 years ago but I remember her fondly. Yet, my uncles pretty much taint any memory of her. All I can think of is, where did she go so terribly wrong? How did she raise such assholes? Getting back to the story, my grandfather was extremely successful and high up in the bank and got my first 2 uncles married before he died. His family is extremely rich too.

Fast forward to shortly before my parent's wedding. My mom meets my aunts and uncles for the first time (arranged marriage with a few dates) and she tells me that when she was left alone with the cunt, she would make these weird faces at her. I've seen her do it to my mom so that's how I know this is all true. Then when everyone came back, the cunt went back to being a sweet, goody two shoes (yep, she's one of those people). 

During the wedding, she somehow convinced my grandmother that my mom had tried to make my cousin who was 6 at the time, carry a large suitcase. My mom said my grandma yelled bloody murder at her which took me aback because like I said, this was the sweetest woman in the world from what I remember.

Now going back to my maternal grandparents. My dad's family doesn't give them any respect because my grandfather isn't rich. My oldest uncle has made a lot of snarky remarks regarding the fact that they don't have much money. One of my dad's cousins kicked my grandpa out when he went to go pay his respects (A thing in India when the poor go to the rich). This is going to be ironic soon enough

Fast-forward to 1996, I'm about 3 years old and my cousins come up to visit (they live in the south, I'm from the Northeast). One of my uncle's (married to the cunt) wants White Castle so my mom being the nice person she is, goes and gets a shitload of white castle. Then in front of everyone, the cunt tells people that my mom has a crush on my uncle. In front of my father. Her children laugh it up and so do my other uncle's kids (they live right next to each other). My mom told me she went to bed sobbing uncontrollably because of that incident.

It's 2007 now. My dad's business is failing and he's in a depressed spell. My mom calls my uncle's house and the cunt picks up. She toys with my mom until she's crying to put my uncle on the phone (cunt uncle and oldest uncle are both doctors). Cunt uncle manages to talk some sense into my dad but this segways into asking help at the wedding.

Ive been silent about the 3rd uncle, because he's perhaps the worst of all. We'll call him asshole. In 2009, Cunt uncle and Oldest Uncle and family went to India for the umpteenth time (my mom and dad cant afford to go. i havent been in 10 years) and my mom asks them to bring back a few bottles of hair care product you can only get in India. I'm talking like hotel sized bottles of shampoo. Instead of bringing it back (about 40 bags between all of them) they ship it via fucking fed-ex. from india. holy shit I thought my mom was gonna kill herself. She flipped out on them, didn't get out of bed for 3 weeks, I didn't speak to my dad because at this point, I was so disappointed in him for not standing up for my mom. During one of my sulking periods, my mom got out of bed and confronted me about it. I was surprised because she's threatened to leave him over this bullshit multiple times. I asked why he doesn't stand up and she said it was because of Asshole Uncle. The reason my dad came to America is because he went to work for my uncle who treated him SO BAD that he decided he couldn't be in the GODDAMN COUNTRY ANYMORE. I literally cannot stress that enough. He uprooted his entire life and moved halfway across the world just because he couldn't take working for that thundercunt one more day. My grandma begged and pleaded but it was that bad. Ironically. asshole's wife who's a lazy piece of shit who also starts shit with my mom is on the receiving end of Cunt's attacks also. It's a fucking Mexican standoff everywhere.

So why aren't we not not speaking? Well quite frankly, I think it has to do with me. See, my cousins aren't the smartest bulbs on the tree, but they'll be fine because their uncles are wealthy. I've worked my ass off and am the first person in the family to get into an Ivy League school. Oh and I hate my cousins too. I'm nice to their banshees of mothers but I know none of them have any respect for mine. They can't even pretend. Part of my motivation is not only to succeed, but to act as a big fuck you to these assholes and show them that my parents were amaizing and just because they were poor and bullyable, doesnt mean you'll fuck with me.

That and the fact that despite ALL OF THIS, this is the only family my dad has left, so my mother, my brother, and I agree to keep going along for his sake. Here's my problem Reddit, my mother and I have agreed to end contact with them once my father dies. Any suggestions on how to go about doing it without looking like it's a side effect of grief or something? I hate these assholes and I want nothing to do with them. Sometimes I think of changing my last name just to avoid association with them, but the thought of my father stops me everytime. Thanks for reading

TL;DR Father's family treats my mom and dad like shit. Mom and I have agreed to keep contact as long as Dad is alive. Once dead, what do we do?

P.S.: Everyone treats me fine to my face. They probably say shit behind my back but i really don't care. I know they're friendly with me because they're going to want something out of me eventually. I'll have to get out of that too....

EDIT: Also, what happens if my father lives to the point where my brother and I are married and have children? How do we walk away from this then?

EDIT 2: These people are manipulative and will stop at nothing. I'm not so worried for me as I am my brother who is sweet and naive and I fear will suffer the same fate as my parents",AskReddit,"AskReddit, my extended family is emotionally abusive towards my mother and father.

oceaniye,1578776059,/r/college/comments/end42a/feeling_like_ive_failed_at_life/,"This is really long, and I apologize for that, but please bare with me as I am really in need of support.

I'm a 3rd year (out of 5) undergrad in biology. I began college majoring in Vocal Performance in the College of Music. I had never considered my future in terms of providing for myself or any type of financial or job security until my first semester of college and the harsh reality of it all led me to decide that I needed to explore other avenues. 

I took a semester to examine other fields of study and eventually decided on biology. My school has two different paths to take with biology, one being Molecular and Cellular, the other being Integrative, or organismal biology. Although I much prefer the MCB topics, I chose the IB route as MCB has a very strict path to follow in terms of sequence of classes and I saw pretty quickly that it would take me many years to complete the degree in that sequence with the extra foundational work I needed to get myself up to speed (I prepared myself in high school to continue with music and therefore very much lacked the math and science background I needed to begin biology) with other biology students. 

Anyway, I'm almost two years into my new major and I feel stuck and desperate. I love biology, with my whole heart. Music really was (and is) my dream but biology is my passion. I've thoroughly enjoyed most of the bio heavy classes I've taken and I know I chose the right major, but I'm not getting the grades I want nor the grades I think I deserve. 

Like most other college freshmen, I didn't know how to study. I graduated high school with a 3.85, having worked, what I thought at the time, was pretty hard. Looking back, however, I never studied but a few handful of times. Even still, I did very well. That level of work today would be earning me Fs though so I had to figure out how to be successful in college-level courses. I think I have done a pretty decent job and I've determined that on the metric of how well I feel I understand the content. I thoroughly enjoy reading my textbooks and diving deep into content, even supplemental content to help me better understand concepts at large and how they interact with each other rather than the general overview that is mostly presented in classes. By the time I am finished studying a concept, I can coherently explain pathways and mechanisms in great detail and I do so enthusiastically. When I practice, I turn to worksheets from class and sometimes problems from the text book. When studying for exams I turn to practice exams if offered and other material from class if they are not. Although I love biology and I want to learn more than just strictly the scope of the classes I'm taking, my time is very limited and grades are important so I try not to spend too much time on content beyond my classes and when practicing I focus on exercises given to me by instructors to limit any diversion away from course goals. 

Even still, I have a 3.1 GPA. I wanted to go to med school. My hardest classes are still yet to come (calc, physics 1&amp;2, 3 chem classes including orgo) and I have no background that will support me in these classes. I have been trying to practice and prepare my math skills as that is mostly where I falter, but I haven't been successful and I'm running out of time. I've taken precalc, finished with a C. I took a prepatory chem class, had a 90% in the class and a 91% exam average, then bombed the final despite studying and really understanding the content, ending with an 85%. I attempted physics last fall and after two panic attacks in the first couple weeks stemming from not being able to wrap my head around the concepts, I had to drop the class

I put everything I have into my classes, I really do, but, somehow, I can't prove it. I have ADD and bad anxiety and for these reasons I am registered with my school's disability resource department and I get testing accommodations through them. Without my accommodation I would be doing much, much worse and I can be thankful for that. I go to therapy regularly as well and I am putting in the work to better myself and become the person I want to be. Still, sometimes I have to use the portion of my accommodation that I have for anxiety because I am too anxious to leave the house or my panic surrounding an exam is so great that I cannot take it that day. Typically this is no issue and my professors are supposed to excuse me from attendance and other assignments for that day, as well as give me the opportunity to take the exam the following day, but I had a professor this last semester that absolutely would not give me that chance and due to loop hole in her course policies and syllabus, she didn't have to. I ended with a C in that class.   

I've had to start considering other options after college because I know my chances of getting into a medical school are pretty slim and quite honestly I don't think I have the room in my schedule anymore to take the supplemental classes I need  (biochem, a 2nd semester of orgo, psych, sociology) in addition to my major. 

I've been considering research, PA/NP school, and nursing school. 

PA/NP school seems unlikely being that they also require a higher GPA and supplemental classes, but mostly,  I don't think my heart is going to be in it. I've watched some YouTube videos about PA/NP school and done a little bit of looking around online and it seems that a big thing in PA/NP interview is the \*why\* you want to be a PA/NP and not a MD. Although I could maybe bullshit this, I know my heart won't be into it as much as it would be in an MD and knowing myself, it will show. 

Nursing seems like a good option but I fear that I will always feel, or at least will have to dedicate a good portion of my life to overcoming, the sense that I am living in the shadow of doctors; Why couldn't I have tried just a little harder and gotten the MD? No disrespect to other nurses, they are incredibly important, but ever since I changed my path, I dreamed of myself in other shoes. Additionally, I have really bad feet and seeing how nurses run around for hours upon hours, I don't think I could withstand the physical demand. 

And research, it just doesn't seem like anything I'm interested in, although I'm starting to feel that it is my best option. I have no background in research whatsoever outside of the lab portion of my classes. I will be looking for a lab to get into this semester as it is an important part of the curriculum for bio at my school. Again the only experience I have is in the lab for class and although I understand that they are not the same, I have hated every minute of the labs I have been forced to endure. Collecting samples is mind numbing, figuring out what tools to use and for what purpose for an experiment is honestly way above my head in difficulty and analyzing data is the absolute last thing I ever want to do. 

I took the time last semester to get my EMT license in addition to my normal classes, just because I really like medicine and I wanted a little taste of what it was like. Now, I really have a hard time accepting the idea of a future without a medical career. The notion of being presented with a problem, investigating in order to diagnose and then dividing a plan to treat, all under the premise of not only helping and supporting someone, but providing them with a better life, is exactly the piece of me that I want to give to the world. But, due to the poor metric used measure the capability and understanding of students, I don't think I ever can. Additionally, due to my poor grades, I feel that even if I do put myself into research job, I'll never make the money I need, especially not the money I want, to support myself, a partner, a family, and my mother who needs great financial help.

What can I do?

Edit: I also want to add that the idea of ""starting over"" at a community college is something I have considered but not really an option for me as I pay for school entirely unassisted by my family, through a $15,000 scholarship that ends next year and loans for all the rest. Financial security is extremely important to me and being $100,000 in debt seems to override financial security of any kind unless I somehow become a millionaire.",college,Feeling like I've failed at Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/end42a/feeling_like_ive_failed_at_life/,1578797659.0,can't pay for school,10.24
[deleted],1307603739,/r/AskReddit/comments/hvc2a/someone_crashes_into_my_car_and_blames_me_reddit/,"Dear reddit,

I apologize for the length but its a very detailed matter. I need some sane-person advice on a legal issue. This is what happened:

I live with 3 other roommates and one of them doesn’t have a car (we will call her Jane) but one of my other roommates lets her use her car to go to work (the one with the car we will call Mary). We all rent the property and all have our names on the lease.

I have a car and I usually park it in the drive way because it is the newest car out of the two and I take care of it. Mary doesn’t care about her car and it has numerous scratches and dings in it, not to mention she lets anyone borrow it for how-ever long they want. One day, I parked it on the street in front of my house because Mary’s car was already in the drive way. I parked my car exactly where Mary usually parks her car and has never had any problems. Our driveway is about 8 feet away from the next drive way, leaving about 8 feet of street between the two to park on. This is the area where I was parked, about 2 to the right of our driveway, next to the neighbor’s driveway. I don’t know how long my car is, but it almost filled the whole space exactly.

Jane got into Mary’s car to go to work and backed out of our driveway at lightning speed. Then she whipped around and smashed Mary’s front headlight into the back bumper of my car. I was asleep while all of this was happening and I woke up to pictures of my car all fucked up and text messages telling me not to park like an asshole.

Jane leaves the scene of the crime and goes off to work. She texts me at work and tells me that she is thinking of having my car towed and that I should be thanking her for not getting our insurance involved.

I wake up and text Jane and ask her what the fuck. She continues to think its my fault and acts like a complete bitch. I then explain to her that SHE hit MY car so her insurance was going to have to cover it. I was parked on my own property.

She apologizes and we talk to Mary. Mary pleads with me over and over not to call the police and make a claim on her insurance because if Mary gets into any more trouble with her car then her dad is taking it away. The insurance and car is in Mary’s dad’s name and she has had a lot of wrecks already. We all make an agreement that I will not call the insurance company or make a police report if Jane agrees to pay for all the damages involved in cash since it is her fault. *let me note here that Mary’s car is really messed up because of this, her whole headlight falls out and my bumper is cracked and scraped all up with Mary’s paint. My car was flawless up until this point and I’ve been really careful with it for 2 years.

We agree to go get the damage assessed tomorrow to see how much Jane is going to have to pay.

I was planning on leaving the next day to go to my hometown and visit my family, so I went ahead and went because I could still drive my car but the back is all messed up.

In my home town I get the family mechanic to look at my car and the best estimate that I could get is that I would have to completely replace the bumper and have that repainted to match the car. I have a new car so parts are expensive. The estimate comes out to 866$ worth of damage to my car.

I call Mary and explain the damage. Mary agrees to the price and tells Jane. Jane and Mary get into a fight about the price and don’t talk for 3 days. I wait it out.

I call back and Mary says that she is no longer involved in the matter and doesn’t want to talk about it. (It’s Marys car so I think that’s fucked up and really ignorant)

A week later, Jane informs me that she talked to a lawyer friend who said the entire deal is my fault because I was parked 2 feet from my driveway instead of 3 like the law states. She says that she will give me 250$ because that’s all my shitty car will cost to get fixed (it’s a new Honda Accord Coupe) and that it’s all my fault and she is prepared to go to court on the matter. She states that her lawyer advised her to no longer discuss the matter unless I take the 250$ offer and settle with that. Mary also talked to her friend who is a New Orleans cop who says it’s also my fault. They gang up and decide to fight me out on the matter to avoid paying for my car.

Now, I know I didn’t file a police report and that was really dumb on my part, but I believed that my friends would keep their words. Jane now has Mary all confused and thinks its somehow my fault so they are both being complete assholes to me and think they are going to get money out of me somehow. I don’t think I have any fault in this matter as it is physically impossible to park 3 feet away from my driveway and I wasn’t even in the car when the accident happened. I refuse to believe that 200$ should cover 866$ worth of damage because I was a foot off. I have complete full-coverage insurance and Mary has liability that she says covers Jane driving her car. I was wondering if I could get some advice or atleast some support in this matter because somehow 3 people that I live with believe that this situation is my fault. I was asleep when someone crashed into my car and I wake up to find that it’s all my fault? I don’t think so. Keep in mind that these are 19 year old girls that are REALLY air-headed and failed out of high school. They also have no morals or sense of responsibility because they JUST moved out of their parents’ house and don’t know how to live on their own.

I’m calling my insurance company tomorrow to explain to them the situation and see what I can do. I don’t have a police report but I have text messages with pictures from Jane admitting what she has done.

I know this is not a legal advise site, but these are the things I was wondering from a legal standpoint: 1- What should I do? Is the 3 foot rule even a law? I cant find it in the Louisiana laws, and I live in New Orleans where there is rarely 3 feet between any of the cars or driveways.

2- Should I call the police and file a Hit-and-Run? Would this count as one since both of our cars are still here? She is the one that hit my car and didn’t file a police report like the law sates.

3- What would happen If I did file a hit-and-run? Could she take me to court?

4- I don’t want to go to court (even though I would win) because the court system in New Orleans is really fucked up and would take forever. Not to mention I would waste more money hiring a lawyer and court costs.

I already talked to the family lawyer and he says that there is no way that it is my fault. I was parked on my own property and she crashed into me. That’s the point of car insurance, right? The worst thing im guilty of is a 30$ parking ticket. She should have to pay the damages done to both cars considering she doesn’t own either of them. If I could just get some advice from anyone that knows the law, or some advice from sane people telling me what It sounds like from an outsiders view, it would really help ease my nerves. I understand anything anyone tells me isnt official legal advise and I am already speaking with my lawyer. I need my car fixed!

By the way, Jane is my ex-girlfriend and completely hates me, so this whole thing was done on PURPOSE out of resentment and isn’t going too well. Yeah, tell me about it…

Thank you so much, this is all I can do to straighten out my thoughts and ease my nerves.

**TL;DR- Psycho ex-girlfriend crashes her friends car into my car and is trying to blame me and take me to court because I was parked “illegally” on my own property. No police report or insurance claim has been made. How do I force her to pay for the damages without going to court?**

crestofthewayv,1580309898,/r/college/comments/evnxz3/from_my_dad/,"I'm in tears right now. My dad, who was absent for most of his life, passed away in October. My lawyer (formerly his lawyer) found some things in one of his old files. One was a letter addressed to his kids. It was a list of life tips for college. This is what she scanned it to me:

1. Call your mom once a week; no more, no less.

2. Do your laundry on quarter draft night (the laundry room will be empty). Fold your clothes before you put them away. Don't use liquid fabric softener on towels, they will shed water like a well oiled duck. Wash your sheets on Thursday (you never know).

3. Keep your dorm room clean. Don't use Febreze.

4. Don't drive if you can ride the bus; don't ride the bus if you can bike; don't bike if you can walk.

5. Don't study in the library stacks; too many people will walk around and disturb you. Study in the Asian heritage section; no one ever goes in there.

6. Take the time to find the hidden burrito place; it will save your life when you're really hungry and it's a good place to take someone on the first date.

7. Get a work study job in the library if you can; food service work study will make you angry.

8. Don't try to study outside.

9. Don't defend your music/book/movie/political tastes by attacking another's.

10. Don't take up smoking as a habit, no matter what.

11. Write notes on anything and everything.

12. Don't buy one of those nifty ID cases with a keyring attached.

13. Don't fall for the easy student credit card applications.

14. Learn the name of the janitor who cleans your dorm and your class buildings.

15. Your first roommate is the first person you meet on campus. It's also the first person you will have disagreements with. Remember, he will be gone at the end of the year, but you'll remember him for the rest of your life.

16. Get stupid-loud-emotional-puking drunk once. Once is all it takes.

17. Learn to be homesick, but do it alone.

18. You will get horribly, terribly, awfully sick at some point during your first semester. Don't try to fight it or deny that it will happen to you. Go to the clinic, get some anti-biotics and let it happen. It will save you for the next 4 years.

19. Only order take-out once a month. Tip the delivery guy well (30-50%, he's most likely a student like you working his way through school).

20. Walk to bars; take a cab home.

21. Never drink alone in your room.

22. If you find yourself in a townie bar, have one beer, tip the bartender well and leave. If you go back, the bartender won't ask you for your drink order, he or she will just set it up on the bar for you without asking. It's an amazing thing to see when someone in service treats you with respect. Return it.

23. Find time to go to the gym.

24. Study two hours for every hour in class.

25. Eat in the dining hall. Avoid foods that don't involve silverware. Don't carb load at breakfast, eat a good-sized lunch, and don't overdo it at dinner. Sit down, eat slow. It should take about an hour PER MEAL.

26. There are 168 hours in every week. Subtract all of the class, study, gym, and eating time. You'll find that you won't be able to sleep 8 hours everyday. This is life, and it will prepare you for adulthood. Nothing interesting happens while you sleep, if it does, you shouldn't have been asleep in the first place.

27. Your professors (the ones with Dr. in front of their names or Ph. D. after) are your first employers. Learn what you need to learn but question them if it doesn't fit. In the end, they will be your job references after college.

28. Your graduate assistants and adjuncts are your peers. They have a lot of useful and pertinent information about how to get through these four years and in the end, the good ones will become your friends. Some of my good friends were once my GA's and adjuncts and we still chat frequently.

29. You will have veterans in your classes. Some folks around you will dismiss their training and experience. They have real world knowledge and have earned your respect.

30. Drink cheap beer when offered (Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light). Drink good beer at the bar (Sam Adams, Dos Equis, Heineken). Keep better beer in your fridge (Murphy's, Bass, Flat Tire).

31. Wean yourself off caffeine during finals week. This may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this one.

32. You are not entitled to your opinion, you're only entitled to what you can defend.

33. You don't deserve a good grade for showing up. You didn't pay for ""A""s, you paid for the seat. Effort pays off, attendance is part of that. It's your money, make sure its well spent.

34. Find your professors' offices and learn their hours; you'll need them.

35. Accept that you will make mistakes and ask for help. It's easier to recover this way than trying to handle it on your own.

36. Be firm in your convictions; if you don't believe in something, chances are, you'll believe anything.

37. There is always a quiet place in the student center. You can usually nap there during the day.

38. When you're walking, keep your feet, but keep your head up. You'll be amazed at how many people will greet you when they can see your face.

39. Don't judge anyone by the anything other than their actions. You don't know their story, just as they don't know yours.

40. Don't text someone in the same room as you. If it can't be said aloud, it can wait until you're in private.

41. Don't email someone in the same building. Get up, walk to where ever he or she is and tell them face to face.

42. Not everything needs to be said. You'll learn what these things are as you go along.

43. Don't refuse an invitation to meet someone's parents. Shake their hands and refer to them as Sir and/or Ma'am until/unless they tell you otherwise. NOT BEFORE.

44. Your first summer job will set you up for success for the rest of your college career.

46. Go to the free concerts on campus.

47. Become a football fan.

48. The other people around you are in the same situation as you are. They are all scared, excited, tired, and apprehensive. You are learning how to adult; its a process; drive it when you can, but more importantly let it happen. The only thing you control are your own actions.

49. Listen to music at a moderate volume in your dorm room with the door open and without headphones. Good conversation starter.

50. Volunteer.

51. Understand what social location is, then pay no attention to it.

52. Buy a tailored suit.

53. It will probably be required, but even if it isn't, take a sports class.

54. Don't eat from the vending machines. Buy a package of your favorite snack and hide it.

55. Hide money in the pockets of your clean clothes.

56. When people hang out in your room, don't let them sit on your bed. During this time in your life when personal space is virtually non-existent, your bed is the closest thing to a sanctuary that you will have.

57. Make sure people take their garbage with them when they leave. This includes emotional garbage.

58. The required classes fill up early. Learn what a ""force add"" is and use it.

59. Wear shower shoes in the shower.

60. Wear house shoes unless you're leaving the building.

61. Own a crazy set of pajamas. Wear them to your earliest final every semester.

62. Send your mother a birthday card every year.

63. Don't let your personal life become a hassle for your roommates or your RA. They are students too.

64. Don't try to drill a hole in the keg to get to the beer inside. A repair bill for the consequences is not a joke. Trust me on this one.

65. Sit in the front of the class.

66. Wear a hat and a heavy coat when the weather gets cold; a hoodie won't cut it.

67. Wear shorts whenever possible.

68. Flip flops are perfectly acceptable. Crocs are never acceptable.

69. Get up early on the weekends. Your Monday self will thank you.

70. Learn how to fix your own appliances. YouTube and a good parts website will keep you from accumulating a storage bin full of easily repaired coffee makers.

71. Dress for dinner on Friday nights and encourage your friends to do the same. Jacket and tie for the men and a skirt/dress just above the knee for the ladies. Even if you’re eating in the dining halls, this will attract the right people to your sphere.",college,From my dad,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/evnxz3/from_my_dad/,1580331498.0,can't pay for school,10.146666666666668
desideraht,1353234446,/r/AskReddit/comments/13e7hn/i_am_in_terrifying_medical_debt_i_am_overwhelmed/,"Sorry if I am not doing this correctly. This is my first post on Reddit.

I went to the ER in 2011. I had no job. I was in for a kidney infection that had gotten so painful that I couldn't walk or stand. I was screaming for hours. It was an emergency situation, though now I'm starting to think I should have gone to Urgent Care... or the clinic. Anything but this, because I have $3,000 in debt sitting over my head  that I can't do anything about. Hence why I'm posting here. I really, really need some advice.

The ER bill from totals to $2522. I already paid over $500 in hospital-related fees. The largest part of my medical bill charges $1615.00 for an ""ER LEVEL IV W/MOD 25"". I've done some research on what my bill means and at first I thought it was inaccurate but now I'm sure it's 100% correct except maybe the mod-25 part. But I really don't know anything, I'm overwhelmed and my head is spinning. I just feel like crying, freaking out, giving up. I'm a cutter, I've been suicidal many times over shit like this, where my life just seems to stop and I can't do anything.

When I went to the ER, I waited in the waiting room for a while before I was put in a bed. I was screaming without pain killers for several hours before they gave me a Cipro, which I'm being billed $97 for (ONE pill). They also gave me some other drugs, all basically at the same time, and I ended up throwing up, so they gave me anti nausea pills. I really think I wouldn't have thrown up if they had given me pain killers sooner. I'm pretty sure it was after that that they gave me Vicodin finally. They did draw blood, collect a urine sample, and perform a pelvic exam.

The truth is, my ER experience was a bad one. They literally let me scream for hours. The nurse stuck her head past the curtain to tell me to shut up because I was ""scaring kids"" who were in the ER. She acted like I was being melodramatic but it basically took them being ANNOYED by me to give me pain killers. They literally held me there a lot longer than I needed to be there, they basically put off giving me pain medication, and it was like they kept me just to reap money out of me. I remember that when I was finally able to give them a urine sample (because for some reason it took them a couple hours to give me a cup) I was utterly pale, dizzy, and disoriented when I scuttled my way to the restroom and nurses were staring at/talking about me rather than helping me. I understand that the tests took a couple hours so I pardon that but after my tests were done I really don't get why I was still there for several more hours in agony for no reason. They eventually basically just told me to go home the way I was, no one bothered to help me out and they basically let me leave looking like the walking dead. Though out of the experience I did get a prescription for antibiotics and Vicodin. Honestly with the way the did things I would have been better off at urgent care.

Here's the other thing. When I was in there, I was signing these papers and talking to them. A financial advisor came in. I was in extreme pain and alone without witnesses, so I may have gotten screwed over. It was hard for me to pay attention. I really should not have been required to make legal decisions in that state, but I simply had to. I felt like I was dying, even though I'm sure I wasn't. I asked very clearly what my check-in fees would be like. I swear they said it would be something like $400. But now they're asking for what totals to over 3 grand for this visit. I remember asking them over and over what this was gonna cost. They kept ""reassuring"" me and yet here I am, totally up to my ears in debt. Collections wants $1500. The bill itself totals to $2522.

I don't want to cry ""victim"" here or sound like I'm on a soapbox, but for medical reasons I did tell them that I am transsexual. A part of me fears that may have a lot to do with why I was basically treated like shit by every nurse and only the doctor was kind to me. However, I do not think that is why my fees are so high. I did some reading and apparently if you are uninsured going to the ER is one of the worst things you can do.

Idk how I'm gonna fix this. You know if I was just a normal person with a normal life I'd still go to school on financial aid and pay off this debt over the next couple of years gradually (presently I make only $400 a month at a part-time job but it's the only place that would hire me after 8 months of looking for a job)... but my transsexuality is really becoming a serious issue. I really need my first surgery. My body is really agonizing at this point and I become more and more suicidal the more I realize I will never be able to save up the $10,000 I need for surgery because more and more shit keeps coming up and getting between me and the help I need. I feel like won't live that long if I have to take years and year to pay this off before I can even start on my chest surgery. I'm serious if this ruins my life I am done...

I keep cutting, too, on my thighs... I just can't seem to stop and yeah obviously I am terrified of trying to seek therapy because every time I try to help myself I just end up in more debt. I'm 22 years old and I feel like such a fucking moron. Most people my age seem to have a grip on this already.

I felt like I was going to be okay but I don't want to have to keep waiting for my surgery. I'm getting so overwhelmed and scared and I feel like I'm going crazy. Everyone else I know is having their surgeries so quickly and getting it covered by insurance and I couldn't even get that when my life was being threatened let alone for this surgery that people consider ""elective"". I'm really starting to lose hope in life and I just don't know where to turn next. And to make matters worse people close to me (family &amp; friends) are mocking me for being ""suicidal"" and they're telling me to stop seeking attention and that kind of shit and I just feel like people are pushing me to the edge.

I feel like financial advisors are just going to try to get more fucking money out of me that I don't have so I feel like I can't trust anyone professionally so I just don't know what to do. I feel completely cornered. I tried to get on stuff like medicare before but because I live with my parents they won't let me. But my parents won't put me on their insurance because they're ticked that I can't afford to pay rent (because of this medical debt). I just don't know what to do anymore.

I know it sounds like I'm not willing to hear any solutions but that isn't true. It's just the ""obvious answers"" are all things that cost money so I'm scared I'll just make my situation even worse by getting more people to bill me.


**I wish I knew how to thank everyone in a post that's like a sticky at the top of the page so I'm just editing it into the first post. I appreciate everyone who has given positive/neutral contributions to the thread, some of you have helped a lot and even though there is not a simple solution to my issue you have given me some ideas that will help me hold on a little bit longer. It's not ideal, I'm not happy, but at least I have some way to move forward, instead of stagnating. Stagnation is when it gets dangerous and I cut and think about suicide. When I feel trapped. As long as there is something for me to do/try that could lead to progress, I reach out and do it and hope for the best. Thanks to everyone who has given new ideas and support. Thanks for putting up with my arguing back, that's just kind of how I gather information and test people's ideas... I tend to need explanations and to dig deeper before I feel safe, so I appreciate everyone who is patient with my difficult personality.**",AskReddit,"I am in terrifying medical debt, I am overwhelmed, I feel like self-harming and feel like I have nowhere to turn.

[deleted],1279045078,/r/AskReddit/comments/cp55q/more_info_about_my_wifes_teeth_that_are_causing/,"well reddit, the [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/corqg/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_i_cant_take_it_anymore/) became too long to share any further information there, so I decided to start this one.  I'll jist the other thread


Financially, I'm barely able to make ends meet.  I have 3 kids.  They never go hungry, but bills keep adding up and we can't get caught up.  If that were the extent of my problems, I never would have mentioned them. 95% of America is in the same boat.  But my beautiful wife, my high school sweetheart, has severe dental issues and we can't afford to fix them. For the past 3 or 4 years, her teeth have been getting worse day by day. (It all started from her second pregnancy where the baby was basically stealing all her calcium) and now she sits up most nights and cries from the pain. 


We get no help from any one, even though her grandma keeps helping her loser sister.  The other thread taught me to not be concerned with granny and who she gives money to, and I'm going to take that to heart. More power to granny and asshole sister in law.


We've cut bills down as much as we can.  We only drink casually. We dont smoke or do drugs. We don't go out much.  We don't eat out much.  My only vice is World of Warcraft, which I play after she goes to sleep.  I dont pay for it. I had 6 months (about to run out) and i wont be renewing. I'm already saddened at the thought of my one escape no longer being an option for me, but such is life. 


Anyway, the other thread convinced me to open a paypal account for donations. [Donate here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=loogielv%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=Restoring%20my%20wife%27s%20beautiful%20smile&amp;item_number=reddit&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)   I did not ask for this and you can read the other thread and see that it was never my intention.  Now you can say i had it planned all along. I can't change your mind, but I assure you, that's not the case. I never in a million years would dream there was a place on the internet where people would come together like this.and offer help and support. I'm relatively new to reddit, so I'm still in shock.  


Anyway, the back story out of the way, the other thread insisted that I prove my wife's problems so they know I'm legit. I offered my [facebook](http://facebook.com/bbelikove) up as well  .  Getting pictures of her mouth is going to be tough.  She wont even let ME see her teeth and hasn't in years.  but I will try.  


more importantly than trying to get more donations, I want to prove to the people that were concerned (and more so the people that already donated) that i'm legit.  That my wonderful wife suffers from pain daily and theres NOTHING I can do about it.  


Many people threw a fit when they found out I have 2 cell phones (my wife and I) and also we're pissed off I pay over $400/mo for a Van payment.  Their response was to goto a land line and ditch the van.  It's just not that simple. 


For starters, I'm upside down in the van, so selling it will get me nothing but debt.  I'll never be able to sell it for what I owe on it.  Secondly, we need the space for 3 kids. Many redditors said get a $10k van. How in the hell am I supposed to do that?  Even if I push the current van off a cliff, and have no upside debt, I still dont have the money for another van and now I have no vehicle for my kids.  Yes we have 2 cars, but the other car is paid in full and a sub compact. It's a toyota echo and our 3 kids will not fit in the backseat with a car seat.  There's NOTHING I can do about the van unless I had some way to get a $10k van. 


Many other redditors lost their mind when they found out I have $100/mo in cell phone bills.  Again all I heard was ""ditch the cell phones"" throw the wife onto a land line etc etc.  That is also not an option.  I have 3 kids.  2 of them goto friends houses after school or during the weekends (playing with friends is free) and we need to be able to get a call in an emergency.  The only other form of income is a side business I run repairing computers.   My customers call me, and if they dont get a call back within a few hours, guess what their next action is?  Calling someone out of the yellowpages.  Losing the cell phone would end up costing me more money than it would save.  Ditching the vans or the cell phone are not an option, or I would have already. 


many of you attacked me for this line of thinking in the other thread, which I feel is horribly unfair.  Yes $500 between a van and cell phones is alot, but I'm stuck with them.  Why didn't people say ""quit paying rent""  or ""sell your kids, they're the biggest burdens"" surely that sounds crazy and counter productive right?  Well the cell phones are a necessity and I'm stuck with the van payment unless I get some way to lose the $7,000 I'm upside down and then get another $10,000 to buy another van.  I'd love to do this, but it's not possible.


We didn't always have these financial problems.  We've been cutting back expenses for over a year and due to that, we've been able to make ends meet, but now, its just not the case.  The other thread gave me some very good ideas on ways to save money, so I'd like to list those here.


1) We have an electric dryer which is probably destroying our power bill. It never dawned on me to air dry our clothes, until Reddit brought it up.  This is brilliant and even if it saves $20/mo (i bet it saves $40 or more) it's well worth it. 


2) Coupons.  I've already started doing this and reddit reassured me it's one of the best ways to cut immediate costs. I purchased $195 worth of stuff for $72 the other day and before that $87 in diapers, wipes and paper products for only $23. That helped us immensely.


3) Charging sister more per hr to baby sit.  Currently she makes about $50-60 per week and babysits about 3 days a week.  We're going to try to get this amount up to about $80-100 per week.  Will keep you posted on this


This thread is just to reiterate how we are trying to make ends meet and I plan to document and blog everything I can so reddit sees we're legit.   I will be making another thread that will focus solely on my wife's dental issues, because people showed the most concern for that, and those that donated wanted proof. 


Also I took alot of flak for not looking into dental school prior to my previous thread.  People didn't read my replies.  We did look into dental schools but none of them take our insurance.  Obviously we can't do any of this without our insurance helping.  The problem is our insurance is shit anyway.  They pay up to $1500 every year, but we have to pay $1500 too, and since none of the dental schools take our insurance, we'd have to foot the entire bill of $3,000.  $3,000 doesn't even fix her smile either, it just stops the pain.  Most likely she'll have to have all of her teeth pulled and get dentures. Implants, bridges and shit that makes her smile pretty again puts the cost horribly out of reach (around $8,000)


At any rate, people attacked me and my family values, my genuineness,  my sincere cry for someone to vent to,  and my general motives in the previous thread.  This thread is a rebuttal to that and a promise that I will provide all proof for those that have donated.  


I asked my wife to call some dental schools and make appointments so we can get an idea of what they would cost (last year it was estimated around $3250) [HERE'S A SCREENSHOT OF OUR CONVO](http://imgur.com/jVgQS.png).  I call her ""momma"" At the end she states she's ""not happy with me"" and then goes into something about a personal friend.   Its important to note, that it's 11:03 as I type this, nearly 1 hr since she said she's not happy with me, and she's STILL not talking to me, because she wants to know what the plan is.  If i was to tell her I need to take a picture of her mouth for reddit, she'd run screaming...


To all that are concerned, to all the kind words, and to all that have donated, I thank you, from the very fiber of all that I am.

SNRNXS,1605324982,/r/college/comments/jtv1y7/i_feel_like_i_wanna_drop_out/,"This feels like something I'd post on r/self or some similar sub but since it involves college I thought it'd be better here.

I know that dropping out is a legitimate option, and lots of people do it. But I feel like if I drop out I'm just giving up. It's not like I've found a perfect job or career for me where I don't need a degree and drop out for that reason. I'm just a 2nd year college student. I only work at a grocery store deli weekends only because otherwise I'm a full time student. But I really don't think college is for me.

I was forced by my family to go into college under the idea that if you don't go to college you'll be stuck working at McDonald's the rest of your life. I know that idea is a bunch of bullshit because there's plenty of people who have led successful careers without going to college. I wanted to take a gap year after high school because I didn't feel I was ready for college just yet. But my mom said no, and forced me to go anyways.

That first semester I majored in architecture. I thought it was what I wanted to do; I had an interest in buildings, and after previously looking over all of the majors my university offers, that was the only one that stood out to me. Come the end of the semester, I had stopped going to my architecture studio class. I felt left out my members of my studio group. Everyone was making things much better than I was. I had no real will to continue in that class anymore.

I ended up dropping that major and going exploratory the next semester. That's when I discovered a new major coming from a satellite campus that had just expanded to the main one, where I was. It was an animation &amp; game design major, which focuses on 3D modeling, animation, digital design, etc. I figured since I like video games and computers it might work out well for me. That's what I've been doing this semester, and I'm starting to feel the same way as I did my architecture class. I don't feel like I'm into it. Everyone else in the class is making things much better than I am. I still have a good grade-- I think the professor must grade based on whether you do the work, not how good you do it. But at this point I'm just half-assing my assignments. I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything.

Some people go to college because they want the ""college experience."" Yeah, well I haven't had that. My first semester I was in a dorm room by myself (by choice; thank god I didn't have to share with someone). I thought I was going to reinvent myself after high school. Back then, I was quiet, not sociable outside my small circle of friends, and never talked unless spoken to or when I needed to for class. I never did any clubs, never went to sports games, school dances including prom, etc. I was never interested in any of it (I actually couldn't go to prom anyways because you needed a date, but I didn't want to go anyways).

Well, I didn't change in college. I never left my room except for class. I didn't do clubs because I went home on weekends (I lived in a dorm, but home was 50 minutes away, couldn't have my car though). No one ever really came out of their rooms on my dorm floor. I never made any friends and barely saw the two I found out also went to my university from high school. I mainly stuck to talking with old friends online, which is really what I always did.

Then COVID happened.

We all got sent home in March. I was so glad, I hated living on campus. My fall semester I made it so it was all online, otherwise I would've needed to pay for a dorm room to literally be there one day of the week for a class I was previously scheduled for that wasn't online for that one meeting time. I did the same thing when I scheduled for spring. But because everything is online, I feel like I'm learning nothing. Well, for most classes I prefer to do it online because they're bullshit core classes that need not exist and I can just google the answers to. But with my current 3D modeling class, even though I watch the videos my professor posts and follow along, I still feel like I've learned hardly anything at all.

The same goes for a Java programming class I have to take. I was never into coding and am only taking it because it's required for the degree, but even though I follow along with the videos, I feel like I learn nothing. Well, maybe I would if I read the textbooks. But I cannot be made to read 40-50 pages per class each week of nothing but text. Hell, I can hardly read story books, I am so burnt out of reading walls of text.

I'm just feeling like maybe college isn't my thing. But dropping out and not knowing what to do with my life isn't my only problem. I'm not in any debt-- I haven't taken any loans to pay for college. It's all been paid for via FAFSA and my mom. She's pretty well off, owning her own company. I don't know how much she makes, but it's enough to cover what FAFSA doesn't and still buy a $50K Ram here, turn around and trade it in on an $85K Lincoln there, etc.

She's paying for my college, and expects me to go through and finish it. If I dropped out, it would absolutely piss her off. I can't imagine what she would do then. Essentially she would've wasted $20-some thousand by now (luckily because I'm not living on campus, all of my classes were covered by FAFSA this semester). I don't know if she would expect me to pay it back, which I sure as hell can't do. Also, back when I dropped out of my architecture major, I didn't tell my mom about it. I figured she'd be furious. The day I went home for winter break, she asked me how everything was going, I just said ""fine"" like usual. But she knew. The day we went back, she said, ""when are you going to tell me that you dropped out of architecture?"" She was mad about that, and on top of it that I didn't tell her. I can't imagine what she'd do if I fully dropped out of college.

And then there's my dad. I haven't lived with him since he divorced my mom when I was 3. He sometimes visits for a couple days or a week or two per year since he's busy with being full time in the military. But recently when he came to visit in August, I told him about my major. He was so excited and supportive of me taking it, saying how it was the future, one of the biggest upcoming industries, etc. If I drop out, I'm going to extremely disappoint him. Not only that, I'll disappoint everyone in my family to the point where I'm pretty sure I'll become estranged.

I just don't know what to do. I don't feel any motivation to keep going through college. But if I drop out, I don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my whole family. I don't know how I can go on. Nothing seems to interest me enough to make a career out of it. And of the things that I do have interest in, either you can't really make a career out of it, it's very high risk, or unrealistic. I like video games, but what sort of job can you make out of it? Streaming? I already know I'd be a bad streamer, and if my mom saw me drop out to do that, she would kill me. The only other stuff I regularly do is watch TV shows, movies, or Youtube videos, and of course I can't make a living doing that. I like cars, and if I could do anything I would like to try and design cars and manufacture them as my own brand, but that's unrealistic for someone like me to do. The only thing I have left is maybe writing. I've been wanting to write a story for a long time now, coming up with tons of ideas and whatnot. But hardly any authors become successful, and it's not something I can just bank on happening.

I don't know what to do. But I'm feeling ever more so each day my time in college is just a waste of it.",college,I feel like I wanna drop out,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jtv1y7/i_feel_like_i_wanna_drop_out/,1605346582.0,can't pay for school,9.926666666666666
[deleted],1352680792,/r/AskReddit/comments/131b2e/my_family_has_taken_very_poor_care_of_their_pets/,"Here are my stories.

As a general disclaimer, I am not abdicating my responsibility in all this. There were places where I could have done certain things differently, but I didn't.

When I was around eight, my parents decided to buy a pure-bred German Shepherd from a local breeder. A year later, they decided to get a second from another breeder and breed a few litters for themselves. These animals were gorgeous, very well bred, and certified with the city as pure-breeds. Our female was a direct descendant of a line of police dogs that had served the police department all their lives. These were not some mutts (not that I think that makes a difference, but think about how much they invested in these animals to begin with! Breeders are only marginally less expensive than pet shops). 

They started to breed the dogs. The female had her first litter at just under two years old- any breeder worth their salt will tell you to wait until the mother is at least three, but that's a minor abuse based on what comes next. She gave birth in a kiddy pool filled with old sheets. It was winter in Southern California (mild though it may be) and the only shelter the new puppies had was a single heating pad hidden under the sheet that had not been changed after the female gave birth. By the by, of 10 pups, four survived that first litter.

When the pups were one month old, the backyard was in total disarray. Swarms of biting flies made the dogs' ears bleed. There was shit everywhere, and I was young enough at the time that it didn't occur to me to go out and clean up without being harassed to do so. (I doubt any of us were that self motivated to shovel dog shit at ten years old, but I could have helped and I didn't.)

The dogs were sold indiscriminately to whoever could afford their price. We got a letter from one owner and the dog looked happy, healthy, and loved. He also looked nothing like the two dirty, fly-bitten dogs in the back that we continued to breed. The second litter fared better and we managed to keep 8 of 11 alive, but the fly problem persisted.

Just a few months later we were forced to move into an apartment and had to give the dogs to someone else. To this day I don’t know if either of them were fixed or if our lady was forced to breed until she died. I don’t know if they’re happy or healthy but I hope they’re in a better place than our shitty backyard. 

Years later, we finally move back into a house. It backs up to a wall, so my parents decided they needed a dog in the backyard to deter people from climbing over. They purchased a Rottweiler from a pet store and stuck him in the backyard. To my knowledge the only interaction he got was from feeding time. We’ll get back to him. 

This was right around the time that my cat, which I’d had since I was five, started to get sick. She frequently urinated and went through water by the gallon, and had trouble sitting. They took her to the vet and treated her for a UTI, and she got better for a little while. However, when she developed another infection, they chose not to act. They moved the cat into my room and no matter what I did I could not keep her litter box clean, she was pissing so often. My room stank of ammonia and they blamed me for it. I had to pry ingrown nails out of her paws because she didn’t leave her cat-cave often enough to shed them. I think I was about thirteen years old. 

She eventually died of kidney failure at 12 years old, after being locked in the garage for years because she stank so bad and stopped cleaning herself. They only took her to the vet when she stopped eating entirely, and by then it was already too late. As for my part, I could have pushed harder to have her taken care of, and we may have caught it if we’d taken her in when she stopped cleaning herself, but I didn’t. I didn’t push hard enough to have her properly taken care of, even though I was in the best position to know about it.

Back to the Rottweiler- there were no biting flies this time, but the dog tore his ear on a bit of ragged fencing in the backyard. His head was in a cone when the neighbor kid came over and started messing with the sides of the cone. She was off to the side so he couldn’t see her, and he lunged at her. He didn’t even lay a single tooth on her, but since he scared the neighbor kid so badly, my parents were persuaded into calling animal services and sending the dog away to be put down. He’d never hurt anyone in his life.

We replaced him with a chocolate lab who is dumber than a fencepost, and she doesn’t see anyone except for when she gets fed. I’m not around to give her the care she needs, even though I know better now. 

Shortly after high school, my best friend had to move into an apartment that would not accept dogs, and so we inherited her miniature daschund. The dog had been emotionally and physically abused in his prior home due to his excessive barking and involuntary urination, but he seemed to fare better in our home. Plus, we have tile floors. This little dog was probably the first dog that I’ve ever really enjoyed, as I am thoroughly a cat person. He was a lap dog through and through, and was only ever happy when he could sleep on someone’s lap.

The first incident happened a year or so ago. My parents came home from a business trip and forgot about several luxury chocolates ( 3 packages of 3, so 9 total) they’d left in their bags. The dog, of course, found them and ate all of them. These were dark chocolate truffles containing chocolate cake and chocolate liqueur, enough cocoa to kill a 90 pound dog. I had not been in the room when he got into the chocolates, as he has free rein of the house, but they noticed the packaging when they got home. When they told me what happened, I immediately told them to take him to the vet, and not wait.

They insisted on calling the restaurant to find out ‘how bad’ the chocolates were for the dog.

Half an hour later, about 45 minutes after he ingested the chocolate, they took him to the vet and they had to pump his stomach. His blood pressure had quadrupled and the vets said they were twenty minutes away from losing the dog entirely. Sadly, this was the first time that it occurred to me that my parents had absolutely no idea how to care for their animals.

Fast forward to this week. The daschund had been yelping randomly, something he used to do whenever he thought someone was going to hurt him. As I mentioned, he was abused in his former home. We couldn’t discern the cause, and he would yelp at extremely odd times, even when no one was touching him. Finally they took him to the vet after 3 weeks of this kind of random pain. Turns out the dog had inexplicably herniated 2 discs in his neck.

The vet gave them muscle relaxants and pain killers to give the dog, with explicit instructions to keep him quiet and immobile. The next day my mother has a house full of guests and lets the dog run free among them, up and down stairs and jumping onto couches.

Today, they decided that the dog is beyond saving and to ‘end his suffering’ they are going to put him down. I have tried to tell them to crate the dog, to keep him in a quiet, calm environment like the vet asked, but they do not listen to me, as they have not listened to me all along.

I am not sad about the dog. Daschunds have skeletal issues as a breed and we expected it. It can’t be helped that his deformed little body hurt itself without our helping it. What I am livid about is their utter lack of care for this animal, and all the others that came before it. I have yet to impress upon my parents that they should not own pets if they cannot care for them, but again, they don’t listen to me.

[deleted],1322221802,/r/AskReddit/comments/motii/need_advice_on_how_to_get_on_my_legs_very_very/,"Okay, Reddit. I'm relatively new. I've been helping in the Suicide and Depression forums, and I've been looking around on all of the usual funny subreddits, I figure I can ask this and see what happens.

This is going to be long, don't say I didn't warn ya.

Let me start off, I'm Adrian. I'm 19, 20 next month. I do games journalism in the down time that I'm not job-hunting or dealing with some problem.

So as of October last year, my parents kicked me out. They didn't like how I wasn't going to college right after high school and how I didn't have a job. I didn't go to college for a few reasons:
1) I was exhausted. I really am positive I would've dropped out of college right away. With the constant onslaught of problems I had with grading in high school on top of all of the emotional distress from random stuff in the past, I was wiped out.
2) I had two trips to go to and they both landed in the first week of college. PAX Prime 2010 and I had a meeting with Lockerz. I was able to pay for them both on my own due to some extra work I did on a few movies a month prior. I didn't want to miss up on either because I was going to as a press member to PAX and the Lockerz meeting was a really good opportunity I could've used on paper in the future.

I didn't work because:
1) I couldn't find a permanent job. The extra parts were temporary jobs.
2) They wanted me to work the the restaurant they owned, but it was a total rip for me to bother. The drive was 30 minutes away and they let me work a maximum of $15 a day. I pretty much would've been paying 3/4 of it for gas.

Anyway, yeah. So they kicked me out. I had no where to go. On top of that, they took my Gerber money and child support money, both which equated to $12,000, I had about $20 in my pocket. I put most of my things like my bed and stuff at my girlfriend's house. Her mom wouldn't let me stay. Even though I've been with her now for 3 years, she's traditional and doesn't like that idea. I stayed with a few friends and finally my grandma let me stay at her house. So I got some money and headed out there on the bus. It's 5 hours away from where I used to live.

As I got there, everything seemed fine, but turns out she was having money issues. She couldn't afford her taxes. My step-father kept holding money from her. It didn't help that she was housing me. They didn't like that. So up until days before the taxes were due, he paid her partially.

That was December 2010. Now, this whole year is a mess. Problem after problem. First, our van broke down (note this). Then our dog got something, I believe the vet said asthma, I dunno though. The roots in the nearby trees hit our sewage pipes. Then when we tried to turn on the air conditioner, there was a problem that ended up driving the cost up even more, a hole popped up in our bathtub causing water to leak everywhere, And just a bunch of other things.

Our diets are horrible. My uncle spends all of his money on food, which is sandwhiches, Totinos pizzas, and Ramen. My grandma has been living off of tortillas and cereal for pretty much the last year. She's incredibly depressed. She feels that this is her fault for being too kind and helpful to everyone. That everyone steps on her. She used to be very lively, but now all she does is sit in her room all day and watch TV. I talk to her, but when I ask what we're going to do she often mentions suicide, so I let it slide a lot of times. She'll never do it, but she's just tired of living in our circumstances.

So, as you may be wondering, yes I have been job hunting here. My grandma warned me before I headed out there that jobs were tight. Last time I remember, it was a small community, which seemed perfect for me to find something in. I found that she was right. I'm in a small town off of El Paso, and there are plenty of places within walking distance, but the problem is there are so many schools nearby that all of the kids take the jobs right away. I've seriously applied at places 3 times and had no dice. The only money source that has opened up is that my YouTube account has recently been okayed for monetization. I should be expecting my first check at the end of next month. It's not that big, so it's not going to make a dent anywhere. Not to mention I specialize in games, and because my Xbox HDD crapped out a few weeks ago, I can't really do anything else on my YouTube.

So there's a few more problems as you might imagine. Our van isn't reliable at all. It breaks down often and is not built for long distance driving. It's broken down two times this year and is bound to be down again shortly, so I can't travel literally anywhere. My grandma is paranoid that it'll break down if I have to drive to work. She's stern on not letting me do that. Also an issue is I don't have official residency in my house here. I, again, haven't left much. I've probably gone into the city less than 5 times. I haven't had the ability, nor the money to really go out and change that, meaning I have no way to get a bank account going under my knowledge. I may be wrong. My parents gave me 0 tips on how to do anything in life, so there's that.

We're winding down on the year. My grandma's taxes got raised more and she can't pay it. Which, side-note: don't ask me how, my this house is under an aunt who won't talk to my grandmother anymore. So she can't sell the house on her own. We have a few things we can try to sell. A few antiques, specifically a Castle Front One-Armed Bandit slot machine. No luck being able to find a place to price it online though.
 
Any who, my family for the most part blocked our number. My grandma contacted my step-father finally, but he said he paid her the rest of the money, which isn't true, unless my grandmother has totally lost that memory. I don't believe it though, since he said he paid it at a time that we were REALLY in a hard time.

My grandmother is 71 and an amputee, but I imagine my other uncle might be able to get her in a retirement home. My Schizophrenic uncle MIGHT be able to go somewhere, but he can't function. He hasn't worked in years. He's out of it. And me, I don't know. It's hard to just get up and go anywhere. I'm going to try a few more things on Monday to see if we can get some money, but afterwards, I'm going to start trying for favors from friends in my other city or something to house me for a bit. Other than that, I don't think I can get an apartment since I have literally zero experience in anything.

This is taking a toll on me though. I very much miss my girlfriend. We've had our rough patches recently due to the distance, but we're trekking forward and still try to help one another. I've been suffering anxiety attacks throughout this year. Sometimes I wake up randomly in the night not being able to breathe, like the wind got knocked out of you. I've lost most of my energy. I can't leave my ""bed"" too often. I say bed in quotes because I don't have a bed, more like cushions, so my sleeping has been awful as well. I talk to people VERY often on Skype, Facebook, and Twitter to replace the social life I don't have. I've gone out with friends three times in the past year. I've talked to few peeps around here, but everyone's busy with something, usually school, so I don't mind them too much.

Whew. That took awhile. Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it. Seriously so thankful. I'm keeping the faith that I have left, but any advice or whatever would be wonderful. I really don't know where to start.

throwmeawayllllll,1331354056,/r/AskReddit/comments/qpwz9/reddit_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"I've read stories before here of people that have gotten fucked over by their partners or others, and I never thought the same thing could happen to me. I couldn't understand how their partners could turn out so bad and crazy after so many years of faithfulness etc. Let me tell you something, it does happen though, and you won't comprehend the speed it goes from perfectly fine to what in the fucking hell just happened.

My girlfriend of 2½ years, tells me she just had an STD check and it was positive. I get worried but she keeps on telling me that it's curable and it will go away really soon, (this happened via phone). I meet her the next day at her place and notice she had been crying before I got there. I am confused at this point, she told me the day before that it wasn't such a big deal and she sounded pretty relaxed. I even told her that she might have gotten it from sitting in a public toilet since I hear people can get std's from that. Anyway, I ask her why she has been crying, and the words that come out are still stuch in my head, (this happened 2 weeks ago).

Now you should know we are both studying at the moment, I am 23 while she is 21, everything has been great, I met her at my summerjob and we fell in love 2 and a half years ago and I've trusted her with pretty much everything. A little info about me is that I'm a foreigner, we live in northern europe and times are tough when your parents can't speak the language properly and can't get the jobs they used to have back home because of the language problems. We didn't choose to move here, we were forced to flee over a decade ago because of war. Not going to go into much detail about it. My parents haven't been doing too well lately, they feel lonely, people here are cold, colder than back home. They miss that, but can't move back yet and have lost their passports on the way out of the country. They have been saving up money as much as they could over the years, while buying us kids everything we have ever needed. I have a little brother who is 6 years younger than me, he is in school aswell. Anyway, this money they have saved over the last 13 years, my dad doesn't even have a car because he wants to save up money to finally be able to build a house back home where he can grow old with my mom. They have been very accepting of my girlfriend even though she isn't from my home country, they like her a lot. Before her it was really hard to bring girls home since they have this image of women in Europe being very cruel and selfish, (if you marry them and have kids, a little misstake will lead to them leaving you and taking the kids with her, you can't trust these women) that's basically what they have been telling me all this time. 

So now here I am, I don't want my parents to know what my girlfriend, or should I say, ex, has done. Since that will lead to them never accepting me to date any women that are foreign, or even start a future with them.
Going back to the actual problem, my girlfriend told me that she has been, for the last 3 months, seeing other people. All the times she told me she was visiting her parents? Nightclubs. All the time she was studying late at school? Getting fucked by some random guys. Turns out she had gotten addicted to sex but didn't want to tell me, or maybe that was just an excuse, I don't know. This isn't even the worst part. She doesn't know who gave her the std, plus she says that I probably may have gotten it myself now, since she doesn't know how long she has had it. I end up taking a test (let me tell you they are expensive as fuck), the results are clean, and I'm glad. Disgusted with her behaviour, that she has been cheating on me, having sex with what she said were only 3-4 others, which I still don't know if it's true or not, and then almost giving me the std she got from someone she cheated with. So many thoughts were going through my head, disgusting ones.. Have I ever come home to her just after she was done fucking someone? Fuck man.. I really felt like someone had thrown a punch to my stomach and I had the feeling of not being able to breathe properly plus wanting to puke at the same time. Now here comes the kicker, after everything she had told me in 2-3 sentences, this last one pretty much topped it all. She tells me that she is pregnant, and she has NO FUCKING IDEA who the father might be. I don't even remember my own reaction when she told me all that, all I did was walk out of there and run home, I ran as fast as I could while it hurt everywhere. After a day of depression and acceptance, I pick up the phone and asnwer her calls. She wants to do a DNA test, wants me to give some blood to see if the child is mine. A week later tests come back and the child is indeed mine. Me not being ready to be a father, with school and everything, and she SURE AS FUCKING HELL not being ready either, I ask her if she is going to abort it. She tells me that she won't. Why? Because she doesn't have any money to pay for it, insurance and all that shit that come with it. This is where I lose my cool for the first time in a long time. I start punching a wall as hard as I can, 8-9 times maybe, I can't feel my right hand anymore. It's alright now, nothing broken just needs some rest, not the real issue here. Now I need to get a hold of 6275,50 euroes to pay for the dna tests, her abortion and hospital fees, a lot of shit that comes with that, and I sure don't have the money for it and neither does she. She isn't planning on telling her parents what a whore she is, and I don't want either. What do I do? I steal the fucking money my parents have saved up, 6300 euroes, it was almost half of it. I felt so shit that day, and I can't look my parents in the eyes ever since, their hopes and dreams of building a house back home where they can stay with family and enjoy themselves a bit again. I took it. It's a matter of time til they will notice it's gone, or notice that something clearly is wrong with me lately. I don't know what to do. The bills are paid, she is up and gone. Left me. Told me she has to get over this situation and that's the reason she doesn't want to see me cause I remind her of it, and that it was my fault she got pregnant...

What can I do? Seriously, is there anything? I need to put that money back, before they realize it's gone. I took another 200 to try and win it back by gambling, but never having done that shit before I lost everything in one night. I've gone over a lot of stuff, asked friends if they want to borrow me money which I will pay back once I start working. But it's a lot of money to just lend to someone. I know I wouldn't give it to any of my friends if they asked.
I really don't know what to do, this is a really dark time for me right now. I can't get any sleep, my studies are getting fucked up over this, and worst of all, what will my parents do once they find out it's gone. I really don't want that happening.

If anyone can give me any advice that would help me further, it would be really amazing. Thank you. 


And thank you for reading, the ones that did. Sorry for the bad english.


tldr: gf fucked me over, told me she had been cheating on me for over 3 months, almost gave me an std, got pregnant with my kid during that time and didn't want to take an abortion because she didn't have the money for it.

1000dollarbride,1556672083,/r/college/comments/bjb5se/ive_fucked_up_again_and_im_lying_to_everyone/,"I'm a college student at a very good college and have a lot of potential. Not to brag, but just so you get an idea, I was accepted to study at Oxford University next year (just though study abroad but still quite competitive).

Yet I feel like that just makes me all the more of a fuck up. I am extremely, extremely behind-- basically failing -- in all my classes and life. Failing, as in, despite all the generous extensions I've received, I still have three weeks to complete basically an entire semester's worth of work. 

That's the biggest issue but on top of this I haven't been taking my antidepressants for a week or so because I just forgot and then I just kept not taking them I don't even know why? And because I'm procrastinating with money stuff and can't find the energy to walk to bank and then the pharmacy I've been going without my ADHD meds for a couple days and using caffeine to compensate. I have missed so many doctor's appointments that I needed to go to. I am also, I believe, a bit of a kleptomaniac (or maybe I'm just a conscience-less asshole) and stole some small things like lipstick from my best friend (she knows we chatted about it and she forgave me) but I recently did it again and she found it and somehow forgave me but I still feel like shit and don't feel like I deserve or can reciprocate her friendship. And I've stolen other things, like clothes lying around campus, foreign money I found in a purse in the lost and found and even books from the library because my account is frozen from lost items and I guess I have no conscience about stealing old books no one reads anyways (except I do feel bad after the fact, sorta..) it's going to catch up with me and I don't even need things!!!! I'm a disaster human and for a long time know one knew but now I feel like my mask isn't slipping and the shame is unbearable.

I owe money to a bunch of different places and people and have an overdue rental laptop I'm too afraid to return because of how late it is. I have it and don't need it but the thought of facing them, after how many emails and calls they've made, and sheepishly being like ""here it is"" makes me want to die. I literally want someone to return it for me! This is so ducking stupid. I also have an overdue tab from on campus cafe from last year! They've been pestering me to pay it (it's like $50 dollars) for like a year but I never have the money and hate asking my parents for help.

To make matters much worse I lost my debit card a over month ago and am too scared now to call and get a new one because what even do I say? I lost this A MONTH AGO? I never even told them to freeze it (the account was zero anyways so I thought it didn't matter). I'm also procrastinating on that because I'd to tell my mom (they have to ship out first to her address) and that is always so shame inducing and stressful.

More ways I'm a fuck up: I haven't recorded the hours I've worked. Partially because I'm too forgetful and/or lazy and embarrassed to ask my boss for retro hours. I desperately need the money, though, and have been selling my clothes to get money to pay for things/bills. I also haven't bothered with it because it goes directly into my credit card which, as you know, I lost a month ago and haven't dealt with. And the class dean keeps calling me because I'm sure my professors have been emailing her (it's a small school where profs notice and care about students, another reason I feel so guilty for letting them down). And of course I am avoiding the dean too because the idea of visiting someone who know how badly I've fucked up scares the shit out of me. I just want to get my shit together a little before I talk to her bt I've been saying that for a month. Any progress I make is so minimal. Like I seem to take three days to just ORGANIZE my planner. Or get everything together and make the calls so I can walk to go and get my ADHD meds? That takes a whole damn day. Not kidding. Now imagine a 7 page paper? Well, two days needed to get everything ready: find the money to buy caffeine pills so I can actually have energy to write, figure out how to steal appropriate library books, ask friend to meet me somewhere to give me the assignment because I lost it and deleted the email on accident, borrow/rent a laptop because I don't own one, walk to library only find out it it closed on the weekends, try to work in dorm but it's too loud, explain to your friends and boyfriend why you never have time to hang out, try to figure out what to write about, have a meltdown, write reddit post because of meltdown, etc etc. Then the writing stage starts and I am writing a the speed of a snail. My eyes hurt and I need a break after spending three hours on a couple sentences, having scoured the thesaurus because none of the words work...

I feel so guilty for throwing away this opportunity, again, especially when so many people are trying to help me. This has happened before too. It's not like I'm a first year. I'm a junior! I feel like I'm letting everyone down again and again. And I want so bad to make them respect me and be prof of me so when I'm talking to them, especially my favorite professor, who honestly loves me because we are just really close and I'm super enthusiastic and smart in his subject. I know he must be getting sick of my excuses/lies, though. I always make promises about turning in stuff that I know I can't keep, just to make him happy and not annoyed and mad in the moment. Like I just say what people want to hear instead of the truth. And then I let them down and feel horrible. And no one trusts me and they shouldn't because I am the least trustworthy and honest person alive and I want to stay in bed and avoid everyone forever.

The worst part is the shame and avoidance and web of lies I've spun. I don't even know how many people I have been lying to so many people I can't keep track.

I probably haven't even mentioned half of the ways I've fucked up lately. This feels like beyond ADHD. It feels like madness. And the lying and hiding and avoiding is about to backfire real hard. I've been daydreaming about suicide to be honest.

I have tried to start therapy again this semester, by the way. But when I went in it was to focus on childhood trauma, a sexual assault as an adult and--mainly-- a childhood sexual abuse/incest situation because I have trouble with sex and with my boyfriend. It would have helped probably but I can't even make my appointments I'm too lazy. That and the fact that's when I start to talk about that stuff it consumes every waking thought and I need to get work done. I'm a very good student sometimes, like I win awards for research and stuff, so my professors have been very understanding. But that can only go so far. I have to turn something in eventually and my brain just feels broken. It can't do anything. But I always feel like this and it has happened again and again and I never seem to improve so how can anyone trust or respect me?

My mom is going to be so mad at me. I will have to stop lying and tell her everything about school. And she will be upset and yell at me, which is normal and expected, but it will be so hard to listen to go on and on and on with the yelling and lecturing me about how hard I make HER life without just shouting at her that I was fucking molested by my dad and never told her, and never will, because I know it will ruin her life!

But at the end of the day it all comes down to me. I'm a liar. And lazy. And cannot be trusted. It will take a lot of work to gain back the respect of everyone.

Making America Beautiful, One Child at a Time

	I understand that in any creator’s eyes, a race of creations should all be beautiful in individual ways, but some people in this country are just plain ugly. People are constantly being pushed around or discriminated or left out simply because they may have oddly shaped features, or their eyes are colored weird, whatever the case may be. People are always being judged, their self-esteem ruined, just because they’re more special than others. 
	
I, as much an American citizen as anyone else I’ve ever been around in public, am always getting weird looks because my nose is a little wide, or because I have a bit of a receding hairline. The list, actually, could go on forever. People are always being mocked because of the size of their ears or hands or butt, and this has been going on since the beginning of human life.

What if differences weren’t visible? I have an idea that could revolutionize America, and maybe even the world. People wouldn’t get stared at or laughed at for any unintended reason any more when leaving their house.

I know that some parents constantly have to fan out money for their children so they can stay with the latest fashion. I bet its hell, and I bet you get fed up and lose paychecks fast. And I bet those less fortunate always have to tell their children that it’s okay, and it’s not the child’s fault they only have one bedroom in their apartment and that the kid has to sleep on the couch or on the floor. 

If adults are really concerned about their children getting made fun of at school for little things, ruining the children’s state of mind, why don’t they do anything about it? All people do for society, not that it’s so much for it as it is to it, is lie to kids and tell them their freakishly disgusting features, the things that cause the parents to not want to be seen with their kids, are the most beautiful part about them. So then, the children hate their parents when they get made fun of in public. Well, I have a plan to solve that.

This plan which I have concocted can cut out the poverty blame game among children and adults. With no variety among life styles, little boys and girls can’t judge each other’s financial situations at home, can they? And if there was no variety among image, whether how kids see themselves or how others see them, the children wouldn’t get their feelings hurt, nor would any kids be an eyesore.

Far too often, I see kids who are left out of “higher” social groups because they can’t afford the new smartphone or the latest shoe fad. I see everyday at lunch in the high school the group of Caucasian children in their “Tapout” shirts and “DC” hats separated from the group of Hispanic children with the same clothes. Why not just get along?  If everyone is willing to conform to my solution, there would be no more racism, discrimination, or teenage suicide because of isolation or bullying ever again. Little heart broken Jimmy may after all get that kiss from Ms. “TOMS”-and-“American Eagle” who he’s been grueling over since 3rd grade.

	If every child is raised, genetically assembled, and taught exactly the same way from birth until high school graduation, isolation will be a thing of the past, and this problem will be solved. Children will be forced to judge themselves before even thinking to judge others.
	
	First, what we must do is shut down every sperm bank and artificial birth institute in the country. No natural sperm and egg can be united again. 

Next, we are to rid every child born from the womb, destroying diversity among generations to come. If my scheme to end diversity in America comes underway, any child given life through a woman’s uterus or unaltered test tubes would be exterminated, so as to not soil our country’s future generations of perfection. No longer would one person be unhappy with the look of another boy or girl.
	
	When the latest generation of any array of race and assortment are extinct, I would then gather the world’s finest scientists to help spawn the perfect child, one of each gender. We would start by artificially uniting an assigned sperm and egg with altered DNA. Then, we’d wait until an embryo is developed for further alterations.

	The ending result of the perfect, non-judgmental, and ultimately respectable race of children, for either gender, after scientifically fixing his and her genes, would grow, all at the very same rate, to have a pale, grayish skin tone, teeth straighter and whiter than any model’s, all pointed features (nose, the edges around the eyes, chin, etc.), hair as golden as the sunrise, and eyes as blue as the midday summer sky. If there is no judgment, we could all be happy.

	The females’ growth rate would match the males, and no one person would be taller or wider than another if they are of the same age. Each and every man and woman in the following generations would be exactly identical. When one of these clones of utter perfection is brought into this world, the next identification number in the queue would be tattooed on the wrist of the child.

	When a child is generated in the genetic assembly line, male or female, it would be born completely sterile, preventing the birth of any children who are any different than the generations prior. When an adult decides he or she wants a child, they would sign a contract for that child and given a date of which the child would be birthed. Each generation of children would be birthed at the same date, so there would be only one age group per class in grade school.

	At birth, each child would be placed in an institute so they can all be raised the exact same and be taught exactly how to think and act. The children would get a specified amount of hours to spend time with their parents; supervised time, of course, so the parents won’t teach the children anything unnecessary.
	The children would stay in these institutes for free, so the children cannot make fun of one another for their financial background. They would stay in the institutes, all being taught, fed, bathed, and perceived exactly the same, until they’re taught well enough to graduate into the real world, where they will be free to live their lives however they like, with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If anyone in the outside world wishes to discriminate against one of these grey-skinned perfectionists, may they be beaten into a thousand deaths, for they would all be exactly alike.

	In a world full of citizens all identical in every way, discrimination and racial slurs and stereotypes would be a thing of the distant past. No one would be different, and everyone would be happy. Without diversity, there would be no mix-ups of people and emotions, so the Earth would spin smoothly without conflict.

	With a flawless plan for a flawless lifestyle, the world would surely turn into a dull, listless place with no means of direction for anything, with no passion for life whatsoever. Even today, society tries to push people like pawns in a game of chess to all strive for the same life goals that are popular with the mainstream lifestyle. If diversity didn’t exist, America would eventually turn into the zombie-looking, Nazi-raised freaks I just described.

	Just because someone doesn’t like the same music as you, or doesn’t wear the same expensive clothes, or can’t afford a nice house like you, doesn’t make them any less human. It’s inhuman to discriminate, as we are all just as evil and repulsive, if not more so, as we are gorgeous in our own way. Any human being sick enough to judge another doesn’t deserve the life of luxury they have over any person. So, next time you think to opinionate someone, ask yourself, what the hell makes you any better than Adolf Hitler or Kim Jong-il for wanting to put down someone just because of their differences?

I am 20 years of age. The thought ""why me"" has crossed my mind so many times now I seriously wonder what the fuck is wrong with me.

Starting since I was a freshman in high school my parents stopped supporting my personal ""wants"". We ate as a family and provided a place to live. However my parents did not buy me clothes, Christmas presents, birthday presents, spending money, cell phone, etc.

Mean while all around me my friends are getting all these nice things from their parents. They get new clothes all the time, expensive gifts, cell phones, more than enough spending money, etc. At first it didn't bother me because I understood money problems.

Skip Freshman year and go to Sophomore year. I have started my own private server on RuneScape (RSPS) and was pulling in around $100-$200/month. I was working online. I programmed Java daily and managed an active vBulletin forum. I started doing this so much it became a fun hobby and I started playing less games and did more work. I became dedicated. Meanwhile watching my friends get spoiled, I was saving my money and opened a bank account to store my profits.

Everything was great. I enjoyed spending all nighters on the private server doing work because the hard work really paid off.


I eventually bought myself a cell phone and some new clothes. I even bought my own internet. I purchased the fastest speed in my area. I also bought a few steam games and even bought some of my friends a few games. Money was never an issue anymore. I even put $100.00 in some stocks on sharebuilder to take a risk. I always looked at my balance before I made a purchase. If something was too expensive I always made a plan to save up for it. I always had a plan.

I was prepared for battle until my server started to die out in my senior year. Months passed and it was dead. I had less than 10 active forum members dedicated to the server. My development or activity didn't change that year. I think the problem was newer servers erupting. Newer servers (508+) became popular. Those servers were replacing original 317s. When my server was dying I didn't want to give up. It took me another year before I finally decided to shut the server down. ""All good things come to an end"" I reminded myself.

Without a server and a community I was depressed. I missed working hard and staying up all night for my members. I really enjoyed the thrill of having a problem and spending all night to fix it. Usually these all nighters is where I learned the most of my knowledge.

Without the community my income stopped. I stopped spending my money as much and became frugal. I portioned out my money and made a plan to keep this money for as long as I could.

Today I still have $200.00 left out of the $2000.00 I had saved.

----

The problem is I feel like this was all for nothing. I cherish my experiences but I feel so fucked up when I come to real life.

I spent two years building a custom computer. It took me two years to finally finish buying everything for my computer. The total cost came out to $1200. I got this computer at the very end of my RSPS days. It's almost like it was a goodbye gift.

The thing that makes me angry the most is my spoiled friend.... My spoiled friend got a custom computer ""given"" to him. It took him two weeks to have a custom gaming computer. His parents bought it for him. He even got a laptop to go with it. Laptop $700. Computer $900. My feelings at this point I feel completely pissed. I worked so hard to get the things I own... He gets them handed to him like it was nothing. He didn't have to work for anything.

I was mad but I still cared about my friends feelings. I bought them steam games on their birthdays. When we hung out and were short on cash I always stepped in and paid the rest. Sometimes I even paid the purchase in full. This hurt me but I took into consideration my friends feelings.

Now that I am down to $200.00 I put a red light on my spending. I stopped spending and explained to them I have no more money to spend. When the steam summer sale was happening I selflessly bought my friend a game. I'm so stupid to have done that. I regret it.

I regret it because my friend lied to me. He said he didn't have any money. A day later he buys 3 games, I can see it on his steam feed. I do not say a word to him and he doesn't mention a word to me. I added up the cost of the games he bought and it came out to $40.00. $40.00....

I didn't have any money I wanted to spend on the steam summer sale but I still got my friend a game because a sale was happening for one of the games he wanted.... I was played. I wonder if I'm being used for money. I bet I am.

When I ask my friends if they can buy me a game it's always the same response, ""I have no money"". My friends are so fucking selfish and spoiled it pisses me the fuck off. I'm raging right now trying to type this. I feel so depressed and hurt.

My friends are so fortunate. They have all these nice things given to them. Why can't I have nice things? Why won't any of my friends buy me anything? Why can't I have gifts? What makes me the loser? Why am I the loser?


My friends are planning a trip on Saturday - Sunday and needed money to contribute on the trip. I told them I have no money. My friend who is spoiled the most, had the guts to tell me to ask my mother for money... Ask my mother? Are you fucking kidding me? My parents have no money. Why can't one of you help me contribute. I've paid for so much shit you guys never paid for why can't you guys pay for me for once? Why are my friends so fucking selfish?

---

To add to this which is really making me angry. I started developing my own project to try and make money and my friend just plays Dota 2 all day long. All he has to worry about is staying up too late while I spend most of my day programming. I hardly play games anymore. I feel so unhappy reddit. I'd like to play games sometimes but I really hate the influence my friend is putting on me. He doesn't have to work for anything and EVERYTHING is given to  him.


What am I supposed to do.... was all my efforts of making my own money wasted? Why is this not benefiting me? I had a feel of self accomplishment at first until I see my friends still being spoiled by their parents. What happened to hard work? What happened to friends looking out for each other? What did I do wrong?


One last thing about my friend that really hurts my pride that I need to release/let go of, is my friends tendency to act like an expert. He acts like he knows what he's talking about. He tried to tell me yesterday .png is a lossless format. I've spend 2 years on a RSPS and wrote a screenshot method for the client. The screenshots were saved as png. I knew about png long before he knew what it was. Other times he tries to tell me things he's only read. He spends too much fucking time on /g/. I've got the fucking experience. He has the guts to tell me how it is... What the fuck is he trying to do? [I think this is my friend](http://i.imgur.com/56SGB.png)

All he does it play dota 2 all day long while I'm working losing money.


What do I do with him reddit? I feel so unfortunate. I feel more calm now all this is off my chest. Does anyone have advice on what to do about my feelings? I feel a mix of jealous &amp; pride-hurt. My ego goes off the charts when my friend tries to tell me how he thinks things are. I'm the one with the experience.

[deleted],1346359700,/r/AskReddit/comments/z3iid/breakup_ditching_college_finding_income_adult/,"I'm living with my boyfriend and his family (moved in a few months ago).  I've been with my boyfriend since high school, but I'm really unsatisfied and want to break up.  I've never broken up with anyone before, and I know by his personality that it's going to go very bad.  Like, screaming, smashing things, telling me to gtfo that instant bad.  But I've decided that it must be done. 

*I'm not happy with him.*  We have nothing in common.  He almost never spends time with me, or pays attention to me, and when he does it's to “get me off his back” and feels forced—he clearly doesn't enjoy it.  He plays video games every waking hour he isn't at his part time job.  8 hours on days he works, and 16+ hours when he's off, from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to bed, taking breaks only to eat and piss.  I try to get him to spend time with me—going on walks, bike rides, watching movies or anime together.  He doesn't want any of it.  He hasn't touched his bike in a month and goes on a five-minute walk with me infrequently.  We don't talk much, even though we're in the same room.  He only fucks me about once a week, and it's push until he cums and then he leaves to go back on the game.  If I try to initiate, he'll tell me he isn't horny and to leave him alone.  I'm a relaxed person, cheerful and quiet, and like doing many different activities (hour or two of this, hour of that), getting out, and trying new things.  He's high-stress, grumpy, and never wants to do anything but game (self-professed and proud of all of these.)  We're just incompatible in every way, and I've finally realized that.

*He's irresponsible and does NOTHING around the house.*  About a week ago I was about to leave for work, running late, and asked him to feed the cat (he was off that day.)  I even texted him a few hours later to remind him.  I come home and ask, and he tells me, no, he never fed her.  Wtf is that?  He couldn't get off the game for five minutes!  He doesn't do any chores around the house, can't even put his dirty clothes in the hamper (I do his laundry), and is a slob.  I don't want to spend my life cleaning up after him and being the only one who gives a shit.  *He's angry and high-stress all the time.*  If I accidentally bump him or hit him with something, (a normal person would go, “Hey!” and then I'd apologize and we'd move on), he smacks me and gets angry and yells, “What the fuck!”  He's always yelling and cursing, short tempered, and impulsive.  If we're in an argument, I can't talk to him at all.  He's just angry and yelling, and if he is really upset he'll grab me by the throat and throw me on the bed.  He's pushed me before and has threatened me with a knife and with a lighter.  He's never actually hurt me (something he likes to bring up if I try talking about this), but *this is not cool and I'm not going to tolerate this.*  I can see it getting outright abusive in the future and I'm not sticking around.

Before this I was living with my dad.  However, I can't get along with him and his girlfriend, and living there was a miserable hell.  About 4 months ago I moved out and came here (yes, our relationship was rocky, but I felt I could NOT stand living with my dad another day and accepted bf's offer to move here.)  I really don't want to move back in with my dad, but could for a short while if I absolutely had to.  What I want to do is get a better job, so I can afford an apartment of my own.

Then there's my college disaster.  *I went to community college for two years, got an associates in Biomedical science with a good GPA.*  Then I went to a public college for a BA.  I had wanted to go for something else, but the school for it was too far away and I wanted to live at home to save money.  So I changed my major to public health and went to this school for a year.  First semester went okay.  Second semester was a catastrophe.  I dropped two classes because I would have failed them, and of the remaining 3 got a B, C, and D.  Up until this point I had a scholarship that was paying for almost all my tuition.  *Now the scholarship has dropped. * I had registered for classes anyway, to continue, but I checked today and apparently I've been dropped.  I don't want to go back, anyway—go into debt for a degree that I can't stand at a school I hate.  So I was thinking of taking time to work, get my shit in order and be independent, and maybe go back for something I actually want in the future at a different college, when I can afford it.

**So I need money to afford an apartment.**  My current job is very shitty—I get one or two shifts a week, and the average paycheck is 50 usd.  But it was my first job, over the summer, and I took what I could get.  I need a new job that can make me real money, so I can be independent.  *I'm a fairly attractive female, and was thinking of something in the adult market.*  Stripping, working in the casinos/shore (I'm near Atlantic City, NJ), or taking erotic photo job listings from craigslist.  (One ad said $2000 for a one-time nude photoshoot.)  I'm pretty shy, but I'd be okay with this.  I've done a camvideo before for $50, involving a fetish, and don't regret it.  Sometimes I post nudes online for fun.  But *I don't know if these craigslist ads are safe and legitimate, or how to find a job doing whatever.*  I'm a little chubby (~5-10 lbs) as compared to porn stars I see on the net, but I can wear a bikini and get good responses, and think I'm acceptable for amateur.  I also know nothing about doing my hair, makeup, or keeping up my appearance, and have no friends or family to teach me.  I don't wear makeup, I cut my own hair, have never styled it, have an uneven tan, and sometimes get blemishes.  All my clothes are pretty cheap and cutesy, and I get mistaken for being 16 (not necessarily a bad thing?).  I'll turn 21 soon, and have thought about doing bartending as I've been told the pay is good, although I know absolutely nothing about alcohol (I could learn?)  I've also looked into doing freelance writing online as my writing skills are pretty good (don't judge me on this post).  The pay seems to be $20 an article to start, if they accept it.  But this isn't a steady, guaranteed income, and might take a few weeks to break into.  I have $1000 in savings and a shitty car.  *All of the ways I can think of to make money might take a while to get, and I have no guarantee.*

That said, my boyfriend is under the impression I'm still going to college come fall.  The semester starts on September 5.  He may find out I'm not going (he's been asking a lot, and often makes me show him my paperwork and college account), and that will cause problems.  So I need to figure out if I can find an apartment and an income source VERY soon.  I also plan to take the cat with me (his parents would be cool with it), and that might cause problems with getting an apartment as many are no-pets-allowed.  

Oh, and I said I had an AS in Biomedical Science.  It doesn't seem like I could get much of a job with it.  The only thing I can think of is lab tech work, but I was terrible in lab portions, and the pay isn't much above minimum wage.  *I've had bad luck with finding a job on my own (my current job was handed to me by my boyfriend's mom) and wouldn't count on finding normal employment any time soon.*

Looking for info and advice on surviving the breakup, finding an apartment, and securing an income source.  My stomach is in knots over this.

I thank you wholeheartedly if you manage to read through it all, but don't hesitate to skip it and post your own story.**

Grew up with no dad, and a mum that didn't really care about him. I'm not sure what sparked his descent, but over the course of about 6 months, he went from one of the best guys I knew in life, to one of the worst people I currently know (granted, I've cut him out of my life now.)

What first clued me into things was his reaction when I got my first car; A 1968 Dodge Charger, and I called him up when it arrived. I was really excited about it, and said he could come take a look if he wanted to, and that I could let him take it for a spin. He agreed, but when he arrived, I could hear faint resentment behind every word he uttered. I decided to kind of leave it there, as I didn't want to make him feel bad (as he drove an 80's Pulsar beater.) If it's any consolation, the 60's Charger eventually died, has been garaged for over a year and I'm now driving an 90's Ford Taurus. But anyway.

Fast-forward a few months. I'm at his place, and we're setting up for a jam session (he's a drummer, and I play guitar), when he pulls out a pack of new strings and says, ""Hey, I got a present for you."" I was pretty happy, as I'd needed strings for quite a while. I was halfway through restringing my guitar, when he says (and I'm certain he waited until I had put the strings on to say this), ""So yeah, you can just pay me back the $18 next week or something."" Now, if I had a job, and a stable source of income, this likely wouldn't have been a big deal, but I was a) 18 and b) unemployed with a very, very small amount of money coming in from the government, which I needed to run my car. I couldn't afford to buy myself anything, and he KNEW this. This was sort of where things really started to spiral.

Enter his 18th party. The day before, we had gotten into a heated argument, the topic of which skips my mind, but it ended with him telling me not to come to his 18th, which was quickly retracted when I asked him why. He told me that we were going to have a few drinks and ""walk away from this still friends."" So I arrive at John's (let's call him) house; the place my 'friend' had asked to hold his party at. I arrive, and go to see him. He hugs me, and I feel like things may just turn out okay. A few hours pass, and we still haven't been able to speak, so I decide to go for a walk with a couple friends. We go for a short walk down the road, sit for a few minutes to have a chat, and then walk back. As we trod down the driveway, I was welcomed by John's entire family, who walked right past my two mates, and straight for me. Now, I had no idea what was going on here, but went with it anyway. John's mother looks at me. ""Have you been smoking marijuana? I don't want any of that shit on my property."" 

*-A bit of backstory here; I had started smoking weed prior to this. Only ever at home, and only ever once a week or so, but this seemed to really grate my 'friend' for whatever reason. He HATED it. To this day I cannot explain why. (fyi, I no longer smoke weed. University and other commitments mean it'll interfere with where I'm heading in life, and I'll be honest, I'm much happier without it.)-*

But anyway, long story short, they searched me, searched my car and SMELLED MY BREATH just to make sure. I later found out that my friend had told John's family that I had been smoking weed at the party, and that it was in my car (which was complete bullshit). He eventually passed out from drinking too much, and we never had our talk. This was the last time I saw him, and I made the decision right then and there that he was no longer my 'friend'. We were over.

In the coming months, I would go on to lose a large portion of the friends both him and I shared. Rumors were spread that I was dealing meth, was a 'hardcore Rastafarian', etc. It was safe to say he had turned a fair few people against me. (It wouldn't be for quite some time that these people soon realized that he was an extremely unstable and controlling person. As a result, my reputation is no longer tarnished, but I have chosen not to rekindle friendships with a fair few of those people.) But the straw that broke the camel's back was just around the corner...

Now, this guy also worked for my dad; a job my dad bent over backwards and took a lot of risks to get him. I won't divulge too many details, but my friend wasn't exactly the best worker. He complained, did a half-assed job most of the time and at the end of the week, went home and bought himself copious amounts of alcohol (which he currently buys for school kids, abusing his age.) Now, before I get to the job, I need to first explain that he had developed a drug habit. The sweet, sweet irony of it all is that this 'habit' was on Kronic; a synthetic cannabinoid that 'mimics' the effects of cannabis, but is (was) 100% legal. His defense was ""it's legal, so the cops can't get you for it"", which I found laughable, considering the research chemicals used in it are HIGHLY dangerous and have caused death in the past AND that cannabis is decriminalized where we live. Anyway, one day he was at work, when my dad asked him to come help lift a steel beam. My mate apparently stared dad down, then ran up and attacked him. (For clarification, my dad doesn't get angry very often, but when he does...) After trying to hold back his anger, dad snapped, grabbed my mate by the scruff of the neck and shoved him against a wall, giving him the verbal beating of his lifetime, and luckily not the physical (dad's an extremely strong man, both mentally and physically, so it was a surprise to hear how angry he had gotten.) That night, he fired my friend.

*-I also heard from my dad and his workmates, that my friend had often described violent sexual fantasies, such as building a cage and trapping a girl in it while he tortured her. This apparently happened weekly, and although I can't confirm it, it wouldn't surprise me.-*

There's a LOT more to go into, but I'll leave it there. In the past two years, he has gone from being one of the most lovable, fun and interesting people, to one of the darkest, most disturbed, self-destructive people I've EVER met. He's turned friends against me, he's attacked my father on the site of the job HE gave him, and has destroyed any chance of us ever being friends again. This was a kid that walked 20km in the pouring rain to my house after fighting with his mother. This was a kid who crashed his car with me inside, and his first thought was whether I was okay. This was a kid who was with me through thick and thin. We were brothers. I just don't know what happened. He always thought that I'd never amount to anything after discovering my marijuana use (in his words, ""I bet he'll get to uni and then drop out after 2 weeks. He won't get through it."") Now he's on the dole, surviving on Burger King every night, drinking himself into a coma each day and hanging out with highschool kids, while I'm at university, about to complete my first year, attempting to make my future a little brighter. Call me bitter, because I am a little, but this is the kind of karma I can happily life with.

Prophecy89,1293473582,/r/AskReddit/comments/es525/life_story_father_issues_am_i_the_bad_guy/,"Disclaimer: This might turn out to be a very long post. You have been warned.


I guess I'll start my story from the beginning. I was born in January of 1989. My mother and father had issues that they couldn't resolve. They file for a divorce. (My mother is black and my father is portuguese)


(My mother told me as I got older that my father denied me as his son. He basically called my mother a slut and asked for a DNA test in court. Turns out I was his son.) 


1989 - 2002
My mother gets full custody of me with my father paying child support. (~$600/m) Of course, you may see $600 a month and think ""Well, that's more than enough to raise a child"" I submit to you, nay, it takes a hell of a lot more than money to raise a child. My mother works a 9 to 5 job in DC for most of her life. She still struggles making ends meat to support us both. We live with her parents (my grandparents) for most of my life. As far as I'm concerned, my grandmother and grandfather more than made up for the absence of my father. Moving on. 


Me and my mother occasionally move to different areas of VA. We live with her best friend for some time. We live in a town house and her friend for some time. We rent an apartment by ourselves for some time. All the while, my mother supports me and puts me through private school. Eventually, my father would send less and less child support on time. I vaguely remember my mother telling me that he was sick and couldn't afford to pay a lot of the child support.  She had a golden heart. She didn't pursue the money in court. Instead, she gets a part time job as a bartender at a local restaurant. She works those two jobs for quite a while. She was an insanely hard worker. She struggled so much, just so I could have all the frivolous shit I wanted. Through these years I would occasionally get a birthday card with some cash from him and his wife. I get the feeling his wife loves me more than he does. (I use to visit them when I was a lot younger)


Fast forward to 2003.


We (me, her, grandparents) move to a new house in Virginia south of where we use to live. She still commutes to D.C. everyday. She no longer works as a bartender because her health is fading. 


2003-2008
Progressively, my mother becomes so ill that she can barely move without intense pain. (Combination of numerous health problems : Sever osteoporosis and anemia amongst other issues) I attend a public high school at my current place of residence and eventually graduate from high school. I can't describe to you the feelings I had to see my mother using a walker at my graduation. I think to myself ""She is only 40 years old, how does this happen."" Surprise, surprise, my father and his wife show up to my graduation. He gives me my congratulations and tells me that if I need anything all I need to do is ask. (A little information about me: I hate asking for help. I would rather work for something myself, than to have it handed over to me).


I attend a local community college for a while from 2007 to early 2008. Around October(?), I start having severe pain in my abdomen. Now, I'm a fairly big guy 6'2 ~260 lbs. I hate asking for help and I figure it will just go away eventually. The pain goes on for a while and progressively gets worse. I start throwing up from time to time. My thought process at the time was: ""Your mother is in far more pain than you are. Stick it out."" So I do. Around December I weigh ~210 lbs. On December 10th, I go in to the doctors office to get some testing done. They give me some nasty chalk stuff to drink for a CT(?) scan. On December 11th (day of scan), I walk upstairs and grab the nasty chalk stuff out of the fridge. I proceed to try to drink it. It is horrible. I tell my grandmother I cant drink it. We'll have to request a different solution. I knock on my mother's door. No answer, I figure she's sleeping. My stomach is in pain, so I go downstairs and go back to bed. I wake up with my grandmother opening my door and telling me my mother has died. All I could do was sit on my bed and cry. I haven't cried that hard in my life. 


The next day, I go in for the CT scan. To my surprise they have this kool-aid tasting drink that will work the same as the nasty chalk stuff. Go figure. Scan complete. All I have to do is wait for results. 


My mother's funeral is set for December 17th. 


December 16th, I get called in to the doctors office. The chief surgeon explains that I have a ""stomach mass."" He doesn't know what it is. It could be cancer. It could be Crohn's. All he knows is that it is cutting off part of my intestines, which is causing the pain and vomiting. (Food cant pass through the intestines, so it comes right back up) He tells me I need immediate surgery to remove the mass. He says we have to do it tomorrow. I explain that my mother's funeral is tomorrow. He says, ""Well, we can do it one hour after the funeral."" 


Okay. (Insert meme face here)


My mother has a beautiful funeral. I see people that I haven't seen in a long time. Old friends and family members. It was nice. 


One hour after the funeral, my mother's best friend (the one who we lived with for a while, shes kind of like my second mother) takes me to get prepped for the surgery. I'm so dehydrated that the nurses miss my veins about 5 times before they can start an IV. I take a shot to the back (sedative) and I go off into happyland. 


I wake up. The epidural is working wonders. I lift the sheets. HOLY SHIT, look at all those staples. I have a stapled incision roughly 12 inches in length from just above my belly button, down. ""That's going to look awesome when its healed"" I think to myself. I glance down to my groin region. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?! Needless to say, I was not expecting a catheter to be there. Naivety on my part. 


Long story short. I spent 5 days in the hospital and was released. Besides the hiccup fit I had upon just returning home, the recovery went well.  The results of the biopsy came back. They still don't know what the fuck that mass was, but they are sure it wasn't cancer or Crohn's. A theory was that my appendix burst and my body ""ate itself."" I don't really know. They kept asking me if I felt a sudden sharp pain one day. I don't really remember anything like that. 


Moving on. 


I'm doing just fine. I attend a local university. Going for a BA in Information Systems. Every now and then I would receive a text or call from my father's wife saying how she misses me and how my father misses me, and all that bs. This December I get a text from her saying that she would love for me to come over their house for Christmas Eve and have dinner. I ignore it. My father had called my cell phone on Christmas Eve. I didnt hear it. He leaves a message saying that he wants me to call him. He leaves his cell number and thats it. 


This morning I get a text from her saying how she wishes I would have been there. She says she understands "" my anger for all the years he wasn't with you"" and that I've ""made a conscious decision not to respond to them"" and this is ""...my way of paying him back to show him how it feels."" Bingo. She's actually right. I just don't feel like he actually wants to mend our relationship. He knows he was wrong for what he did to me and my mother. It seems his wife cares more about me than he does.


Am I wrong for being angry and upset? Am I wrong for wanting him to feel like I did for 20 years? Maybe I'm just bitter. Maybe I'm immature. Am I the bad guy?",AskReddit,Life story. Father Issues.

Blips_n_Pips,1661392702,/r/college/comments/wx1hiq/why_all_student_loans_should_be_cancelled/," Hey guys, this is going to be a little long but I'd appreciate it if you stuck around and read the whole thing. Spoilers, this is about student loans and student loan forgiveness but I think this story is important to tell. For those who don't know me or know much about me, I am a mechanical engineer and I graduated from the University of Florida after 5 years of school there. Right now, I definitely have a great and very comfortable life, this has a lot to do with my career path as well as many other factors. I currently have 10 Professional Engineering licenses, have currently applied for my license in 4 more states and plan on applying for more, and I also have a Certified Safety Professional license. For most people the qualifications I have are like ""end game"" stuff, like pinnacle of their career and most people stop after getting any one of what I have which of course is not my style. All of that said obviously it was not easy getting here but, save for some of my closer friends most people probably don't know how hard it really was.  


Originally I had gotten early admissions into Virginia Techs Mechanical Engineering program when I was a senior in high school, of course like most HS students I was excited especially because the deal I had been told since elementary school was ""you get good grades and get into Virginia Techs engineering program and you will go there and go far"" and obviously I held up my end of the deal and got in, not only in but in early like before most of my friends even had the opportunity to apply anywhere. Fast forward to orientation, I was visiting the school with my mom and I was IN LINE to get my student ID. It was a dream come true, at that point I called to sort out the financial end of this journey and that's more or less when I learned that there was no money to pay for this and because I was out of state 4 years would be roughly $200,000 dollars with classes, books, rent, food, etc. I didn't even get my student ID what was the point. But more dreadfully I didn't apply anywhere else because why would I? I mean like I said... I HELD UP MY END OF THE DEAL. I knew that I got in the November of my senior year and you couldn't apply to FL schools until like Jan/Feb so I didn't need to. Granted most people would have probably taken a year off or given up or whatever I don't know I don't think that way, so I IMMEDIATLY set up a meeting at UWF who, at the time, DID NOT HAVE ANY ENGINEERING PROGRAM. I applied with literally 2 weeks before classes started, and thankfully I had a 4.28 GPA so the doors were swung open for me. I decided to ""create"" an AA degree that focused on Engineering pre-requisites (Calculus 1-3, Physics 1-2, Chemistry, ect.) and did it, I applied to UF and UCF and got into both (my GPA was like 3.8 or something so I was favorable) I of course chose UF as they are known for their stellar Engineering program. But, rewind to what started this situation, lack of money. I had been paying for UWF out of my own pocket entirely (no student loans) not in short due to the fact I could stay home and live rent and food free. But now there is the challenge of UF with rent, food, and a more expensive school. This is what my next 3 years was. I would serve tables/work at marinas/generally bust my ass EVERY summer. 3 months of getting as much money as I could. Then I would go to Gainesville in the fall and first thing was to pay THE ENTIRE YEARS worth of rent, then I would go to the student affairs office and pay for THE ENTIRE YEARS worth of classes. This way I would know exactly how much money I had left to survive for the rest of the year. 95% of my days were the same meals (save for special occasions/friends chipping in for a fun house meal) but those were, 2 eggs, 1 piece of white toast, and 2-3 sausage links for breakfast (most days), Nature Valley bar for lunch, Plain Peanutbutter sandwhich w/ pretzel sticks and red Gatorade made from powder for dinner. For 3 years. I rarely went out and when we did it was usually something cheap like $1 burger night at Mother's. I am glad I don't drink at all because I couldn't afford it, which also means I didn't really party in college (not that I cared) but the big whammy was I got through all 5 years of Engineering School with NO TEXTBOOKS. THAT FUCKING SUCKED, do you know how hard that is? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A FUCKING DIFERENTIAL EQUATION IS? DO YOU KNOW THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKIN AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO STUDY WITHOUT NEEDING OTHER PEOPLE? YEA FUCK I'M MAD THINKING ABOUT IT. I would see people fail a class and all I could think is ""how the fuck can you afford to do that?"". But I did it, I went through all 5 years and you know what. I toughed it out, I ""pulled myself up by my bootstraps"" or whatever bullshit people like to say. I paid for ALL OF IT MYSELF. I had NO BOOKS, I ate A METRIC FUCK TON OF PEANUT BUTTER, and I have NO DEBT, NO STUDENT LOANS, and I'm not going to lie...I have a GREAT appreciation for my degree and what I had to do to get it.  


Fast forward to now, like I said I am successful, have a great house, make good money, and am very very comfortable. And it did it all with no help financially, and worked very hard, and went through an ASS TON of struggles but I did it and would do it again. Blood, sweat, tears, pain, all of it, I know I could do it again if I had to and I know it CAN be done since well... I did it.   


So what about that guy who didn't work as hard as I did every year? The kids who  just took loans and could concentrate purely on studies and not worry about all the shit I had to worry about? The ones who got do have a crazy fun time and have a carefree college experience before entering the real world? Do I think they should get that money just GIVEN BACK, no issues? Where I worked like a dog and stressed out?  


Do I think student loans should be forgiven when I had it so bad? ABSO-FUCKING-LUTLY. I swear to god, I would pay ANY amount of extra taxes to make sure that NO FUCKING BODY has to go through what I went through. Your college years should be spent not only learning and guiding your life toward a career, but it should also be your ""last stop"" of pure carefree life before you start the real deal. And schools tuitions and books and all of that nonsense ROBS you of that. It robbed me of it. That isn't to say, I didn't have fun in college and made great friends and had good experiences. But god.... I cant even imagine how great it would have been if I had NO FINANCIAL STRESS.  


I will end this story with a quick counter argument to something I have read a lot in regards to Student Loan Forgiveness or Free College. And that is ""if its too expensive don't go to college do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and you know what that argument is BS, I love math, I love engineering, THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO. and I DESERVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. As far as ""you don't need a degree though"" Like I said currently I have 10 Professional Engineering Licenses and have applied for it in MANY more states and you know what the first question after your name is? ""Where did you go to school, which engineering did you study, when did you graduate""  


So ya, for my life I absolutely needed a college degree, and yea even though I never had student loans, I absolutely think not only should ALL loans be forgiven, but all future tuition and books should be free. If we can bail out decrepit billionaires we can pay for our future citizens.

puterjess,1494951923,/r/college/comments/6bihso/seeking_input_on_my_list_of_potential_transfer/,"Hi, my name is Jessica and next year in fall 2017 I will be entering my second year of Nassau Community College. I currently have a 3.87 GPA and hope to have a 3.92 by the end of the Fall semester. This may be long, so I'm sorry about that. If any one has school suggestions, see a school on my list that you think I should get rid of, or just transfer advice in general I would be very thankful.

List of schools *PS this list consist of a lot of reach schools at the moment

1.University of Virginia
2. Pomona College
3. Penn State (was previously accepted)
4. University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
5. Syracuse University
6. Vanderbilt
7. Tulane
8. University of Southern California
9. Pitzer College
10. Colgate University
11. Claremont McKenna College
12. George Washington
I'm also applying to 4 SUNYs but the only one I'm certain about is Binghampton

I don't want to apply to as many schools as I listed, the list used to be a lot longer. I took out a lot of schools that didn't offer a lot of financial aid. My EFC is 1320 but my mom can't actually contribute anything (she's in the process of paying me back money).

I've recently added UVA to my list because it has a lot of the things I want in a school. It's a big school with D1 sports, I think it has a good location, has generous financial aid, I looked into my major requirements and I liked the classes. I like the programs, the school has this good vibe about it if that makes sense. Honestly when I saw the website I just really like the school then when I looked at their academics I liked it a lot more.

Pomona has a ""Politics, Economics, Philosophy"" major that I like a lot. I'm currently a political science major but if I went to Pomona I would define lay try and change it to that. Pomona is a really good school for my major. It's in California which I love. I like that you can take classes at any one of the colleges on the Claremont campuses because I saw that some of he other schools had classes I liked. One of the drawbacks for me is how liberal the school is. When reading reviews about the school on Niche, which I do for every school I look at, the students said it was overwhelmingly liberal which is annoying to me. I also think they take the least amount of transfers of any school on my list.

Penn state was my dream school, I thought it was the best of both worlds academically and socially. I still think that but when I got accepted the first time I got about 25,000 in aid and this school cost over 50,000 for an out of state student so I don't think it would be financially doable honestly. When I visited I liked the people a lot more than I like the school. When I slept over at a dorm and ate in the cafe a lot of students sat with me and I thought that was really nice. This city girl also saw a cow for the first time which was cool. But when I got to the campus it was kind of a dud.I

I like UNC for a lot of the reasons I like UVA, big state school that still offers a good name and friendly people. A girl I watch on YouTube just graduated from UNC but I watch her vlogs and it seems like a great place. She shows the good and the bad, the activities, sororities, and sports etc and it seems like a place I could be happy.

Syracuse, I remember applying to Syracuse in highschool and then having the worse interview of my life so I pulled my application. Honestly right now I can't tell you what I like about Syracuse other than it's environment of students because I keep thinking about how mad that admissions officer made me. I know one negative about the school is the price tag.

Vanderbilt is really good for my major. I spoke to a representative at a college fair I went to this year and she told me I had a real shot of getting in. I like the program and internship opportunities I was told about. The main thing that concerns me is he schools location. I'm from NYC and I'm black. I've never directly faced racism so I honestly don't think about it that much so when I met with the Vanderbilt lady, I had never heard of the school before that, I thought this school is great I hope I get in. Then, as stupid as this sounds, I watched family guy last night where they drive through the south then got arrested and that freaked me out. Then I looked up most racist states and Tennessee was on the list. So that bothered me because I didn't know what to do with that information.

My hand is tired and for the rest of the schools it's mainly the same reasons as listed above. About the SUNYs btw the reason I'm not focused on them is because during my first application process my school pushed SUNYs onto us hard and I applied to four then like I am going to now. It was the most complicated process ever, they lost everything, I was supposed to be going to Buffalo and they changed the housing and over admitted people, the housing was so much money and the SUNYS I got into ended up costing more or around the same as most of the schools I got into. I am applying again but there aren't any that I love.

I want to go to a big school but I'm not against a small school. I want to go to a school where I can go to games I love hockey and baseball. No I wouldn't go to a school based on their sports but I am taking into account how much I will enjoy the school itself. I hated my highschool, I don't like my home life (it's one of my motivators in doing well, the thought of being able to leave), and I'm just not happy with my current situation so I want to be in a place where I will be happy. I plan on going to Law School, hopefully a tier one because I want to go into coorporate law. I want to have an internship while in school. I want to live somewhere really different from NYC because I've never loved any where else. I want to study abroad because I went on a highschool trip to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein and I loved it there. As I said before I'm not into an extremely liberal school like Reed. And if the school is liberal I just don't want it to always be the topic of conversation. I want to dorm so I can have that experience. I don't think I can afford a sorority but I've always liked the thought of them. I don't care if the school is predominantly white or what the demographics are as long as it's a good environment to be in. I'm fine with any size classes, all my classes now have about 25 people but I'm not a big talker so I wouldn't mind a bigger room.

lacroixalty,1533760002,/r/college/comments/95pppu/the_college_guide_for_poor_kids/,"hi r/college!

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there’s an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there’s hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don’t really get paid enough to live because there’s a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can’t afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You’d think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that’s just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly “progressive” institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don’t qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn’t cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can’t afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn’t realize until this year that there’s an easy loophole around this if you’re able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I’ve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn’t been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I’m constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can’t pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so “in a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones”). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can’t. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can’t. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn’t worth it. 
7. Parents: If you’re a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there’s a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There’s the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there’s the world of academia and security that you’re introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can’t really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven’t experienced it. You can’t ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they’ve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I’ve been in school, the more I’ve been able to find people in a similar boat. We’re all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There’s a huge pressure, once again especially if you’re the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That’s perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don’t approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I’ve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can’t always afford them even if you’re working. This is even harder if you can’t ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you’re apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven’t had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you’re taking and explain the situation. They’re a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe’s is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don’t hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you’re on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That’s all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn’t from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school.

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there’s an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there’s hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don’t really get paid enough to live because there’s a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can’t afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You’d think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that’s just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly “progressive” institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don’t qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn’t cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can’t afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn’t realize until this year that there’s an easy loophole around this if you’re able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I’ve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn’t been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I’m constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can’t pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so “in a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones”). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can’t. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can’t. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn’t worth it. 
7. Parents: If you’re a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there’s a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There’s the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there’s the world of academia and security that you’re introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can’t really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven’t experienced it. You can’t ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they’ve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I’ve been in school, the more I’ve been able to find people in a similar boat. We’re all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There’s a huge pressure, once again especially if you’re the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That’s perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don’t approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I’ve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can’t always afford them even if you’re working. This is even harder if you can’t ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you’re apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven’t had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you’re taking and explain the situation. They’re a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe’s is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don’t hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you’re on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That’s all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn’t from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school.

[deleted],1407349826,/r/college/comments/2ct5wi/the_myth_of_a_college_education/,"Here's some background:  25F, degrees obtained:  BS/MA, total student loan debt:  ~100K, monthly income now: ~1800.  When I was growing up, not going to college wasn't an option.  The school drilled it into our heads that we had to go to college or else we would end up old, alone, and living in a van under a bridge.  In addition to the school drilling it into my head, my parents always taught me that going to college was the only way and the means to a brighter future.  My parents did not even go to college so they didn't know any better.  It's just what universities have been drilling in people's heads over and over for years now.  So anyway, when I was of age, I attended college at a local university.  When I entered, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.  After changing my major about a million times I finally settled down on psychology b/c I was naturally good at it (not like it's hard anyway) and I enjoyed studying it.  I chose to focus on neuropsychology b/c I thought the brain was fascinating and I loved biology.  While going through school, I also got the full ""college experience"" aka drinking every night and partying (glad I now owe $100k for that...) whilst keeping a 3.8/4 grade pt average.  For those of you who don't know much about psychology, you pretty much need a Masters or a Ph.D to do anything with it.  Hence, why I got a Masters.  

Here I sit now, a 100k in debt with a neuropsychology assistant position and only earning about $2,000 a month (you need a Ph. D. to be a neuropsychologist).  Here is what I learned from going to college:

1.  A diploma is piece of paper that is too damn expensive--100k to get a damn piece of paper is ridiculous.  Some say ""oh, but an education is priceless.""  I agree an education is very important, but which venue you choose to get that education from decides the price of that education.  Literally, everything I learned in college I could have read out of books or elsewhere on my own time for a lot less money.  Mind you, nearly everything I learned in college is forgotten.  However, jobs don't care if you have all the knowledge in the world about that field, they care about the initials behind you name because apparently how you learned that education is more important.  Additionally, paying that much money for a bleak future and lost time is equivalent to rape.  There is no guarantee that you will become employed.  What happens to your student loans if you have to declare bankruptcy?  NOTHING.  You still have to pay for them.  Student loans are entirely too easy to get and being able to afford school without them is impossible.  Who would give a $30,000 loan/year to an 18 year old, fresh out of high school, without knowing anything else about them?  Oh, the government and private student loan companies.  Why?  This is because they know that they have these KIDS locked down for 30 years into this debt plus interest that they can never escape.  Debt=slavery. The cost of college is absurd and rising.  People see universities as this good natured, omnibenevolent organization for the people, but in reality, a university is a business.  They are trying to make money just like every other business. 

2.  College should be for fine arts, not the sciences.  There should be separate schools for medical degrees, dental degrees, pharmacy degrees, engineering degrees, etc.  The separate schools could offer a more focused course load rather than making you take an IS course such as math and politics or a women's studies course.  These courses offer nothing to student or the field of study.  Paying $800+ for a course that will in no way benefit you, yet is required in order for you to do what you want is the fine print of a bad business negotiation.  Moreover, if you can pass the licensure test for a job, you should be able to work in that job without a college degree.  For example, for engineering, you have to take the FE AND have a college degree in order to become an engineer.  Same thing to become a counselor.  You have to have a master's, but you also have to pass licensure.  Now, if all the information you really need to know for that job is on that licensure test, shouldn't you just be able to get the title with passing that test without the additional requirement of a college degree?  It's a scam and the universities are just raking in the money.  

3.  A college degree is equivalent to getting through Jr. High.  College just isn't as prestigious as it once might have been.  A college degree actually used to mean something, where now-a-days, every joe shmo has one.  Universities let anyone and everyone into college now and the people who graduate are just a dumb as they were when they entered college.  IQ scores are traveling downward and now universities are teaching what others should have learned in high school or even Jr. high.  If universities want their degree to mean something, they need to be cut throat.  First, don't let everyone in.  Getting in should be competitive just like a Ph. D or Master's program.  Second, FAIL people regularly if they do not meet the standards of the course.  For example, there was a girl in one of my courses who clearly should not have passed the course.  She handed papers in late (when the syllabus said no late papers) or didn't hand them in at all.  The professor still passed the girl probably because she didn't want to ""hurt her feelings.""  By her passing this girl that didn't do the work, the professor just shit all over my degree.  It's worth nothing.  It is saying that you can get that piece of paper without doing any work.  Greeeat. Glad I'm literally paying for a piece of paper rather than earning it....     

4.  The ""college experience"" is a joke--The ""college experience"" amounts to drinking and partying with your friends.  What did that teach me?  That I'm an idiot for paying that much money in order to get it.  People always rave about how college was the best days of their life.  Sorry, but I don't believe that paying 100K in order to drink with my friends were the best days of my life nor is it necessary.  I think I can drink with my friends on my own time with my own money.  This idea of an experience has become so engrained in people's minds that they feel that have to go to college to party.  News alert-you don't.  News alert-if you really want to drink at college, you can without being a student.....mind blown.  People say ""the college experience is about opening up your mind and gaining new experiences.""  Read some goddamned books for once and ""open up your eyes"" yourself to different view points.  Critical thinking skills are of the utmost importance and you're never going to get them if you just rely on a professor telling you what to think and how things are.  This selling of a ""college experience"" is just another way to rope in people to spend thousands of dollars, and I bought it.  How pathetic.

So if you are beginning to think about college, think about your options.
1. you could go to college, owe thousands of dollars, get out when you are 24+, and still not have a job
2.  you could go to trade school, owe less money, get out at 19 or so, and have a better chance of getting a job
3.  you could learn a skill on your own time, start at any age (16+), owe nothing, and be building your own business while others are wasting their life in college
4.  you could start a career in a business (such as McDonalds), start at age 16, owe nothing, and be working your way up the ladder so that you are already making more than them college folk by the time they get their degree.

Speak with your pockets.  If you are just giving universities money to go to college even though you know it's all a scam/joke you are giving them the power and things will never change.  If their enrollment begins to drop, prices of education will go down and they will start listening to what people really want.  If only I knew all of this before I went to college.

rant over.

[deleted],1340305076,/r/AskReddit/comments/ve88g/whats_one_goal_that_you_need_help_to_complete/,"Alright here goes, my first post to reddit after being a 5+ year lurker.  I would recommend only beginning to read this post if you have some time or actually care about other people's bumps on the road of life.  The goal that I am in need of help in completion is saving enough money so that I can not only pay the rest of my tuition for school, but ALSO be able to afford a car before I am 26 years old.  Here's my story: 

I attended high school in a highly affluent area.  We're talking the high school where students turn 16 and are bought a new BMW or Mercedes by their parents.  Having a large family, my parents obviously could not afford to do this for my four siblings and I, especially when they were in the process of saving money to put the five of us through college.  I graduated in 2007 and like most graduates immediately after high school was encouraged to go to college without taking time off to work or travel, or for health reasons.  So I did, and I went to a University that was about 400 miles away from home.  
Initially University was extremely exciting.  I began working out, making new friends with my dorm/suite mates, and setting goals for myself.  (I later found out that the dorm I stayed in produced the lowest GPA and highest dropout rate of any on campus housing due to its prison like appearance and being the only all male dorm on a massive campus).  During the course of my freshman year there, my parents failed to send me my depression medication on time every month (I was diagnosed as clinically depressed as a freshman in high school).  This lead to periods of deep depression which included feelings of hopelessness, periods where all I could do for relief was hope to stay asleep, and bouts of random crying/suicidal thoughts.  In turn, I began to miss my classes and perform poorly academically.  I even resorted to periods of drug experimentation, as a way of self medicating in an attempt to not constantly feel horrible.  

My sophomore year I found myself on academic probation.  My first semester I was so depressed I believed that I did not want to be in school at all, and took four F's.  The next semester I was on academic warning and told I would have to achieve a certain GPA to be able to continue attending University.  I fell short of that GPA by about .2.

The next year I was out of school, but living at home with my parents who have been fighting for about 30 years now.  (This is where I still live but I am getting there.)  I decided that it made more sense to move back to the town in which I attended University in as that was where my friends lived and where my girlfriend at the time was going to continue attending.  I said goodbye to my parents and moved back to Greenville, NC on my own with about $400 dollars to spare for finding a place to live and getting my first month's rent out of the way.  I rode there with my now x-girlfriend.

I found a cheap apartment to share with others and took a minimum wage job as a dishwasher in a Mexican restaurant downtown.  I was working 5 nights a week sometimes until 2 in the morning for minimum wage.  Yes I was scraping half eaten food scraps from the plates and getting recycling ""juice"" spilled on me when I took the trash out.  However, I had to work to be able to afford something that I wanted, and this made me happy.  I was glad that I had a new perspective and work ethic that many people I went to high school with will never experience in their entire lives.  (To this day my friends credit cards, cell phones, car payments, and insurance are still all taken care of by their parents.)  I made dirt money for hard work, but I continued doing it for a while as I had my girl and I had my friends.

After working and living in Greenville for about a year and a half, I had an awakening.  I was 21 years old, living in a crummy apartment, had no cell phone, and was working a dead end job to stay broke.  I realized that the only way I was going to make it out of this lifestyle of poverty I had seemed to have chosen was to move back home to Pennsylvania and get into community college.  There, I realized, I would be able to raise my GPA to the point where I could get back into a University again.  

At some point I woke up, and began being productive in some way every day.  I have come such a long way in just two years.  I am now 23.  I am living at home so that I have access to a vehicle that allowed me to commute these past few semesters. (My parents car.)  I recently graduated and got my associates degree in general studies from a community college with a GPA of 3.51 while simultaneously working most days out of the week.  Using my GPA and writing a letter of intent that had many of the details of this post, I was able to get accepted into the Microbiology program at my local University.  The money that I have been saving is going to paying my cell phone and gas money in commuting every day.  In addition, whatever money I save my grandfather told me that he would match, and we could put that sum together toward my massive tuition bill coming up in a few short months.  I received one grant for school and a good amount of money in loans, but the cost of tuition and books for University now is simply astounding.  
In October I will turn 24.  I will be attending University in a Microbiology program and have so many new opportunities and my whole life ahead of me.  Unfortunately, I may have to go five semesters in order to get my degree.  I will not be able to work nearly as much as I am going to have to be studying many hours every day.  This pushes off my projections of being able to afford my own car until I am about half way through my 26th year of life.  I don't wish this for myself.  I know that when I do eventually get a car I will appreciate it infinitely more than most all of my peers, but this doesn't make it any easier.  I finally wrote out my story as I have been wanting to document it, but I also turned to reddit for help.  Yes, life isn't fair, and everyone has their own problems.  I suppose I turned to reddit because of some of the amazing things I have seen everyone do over the years.  I'm sure that I will get plenty of angry or mean comments from this thread.  My goal is to be able to save enough for University AND a car, and at $9.00 an hr part time work this is realistically impossible.  This is my goal that I am in need of help with.  This is something that has been making me depressed for quite some time now.  I ask those of you who read this far, please help me out in realizing my dreams.  I don't care if it is advice, networking, or a small donation.  My paypal account is spl1014@gmail.com.  In addition to working part time I have also been selling items out of my basement on ebay, but even this is a tiny drop in the bucket of what I will need to be able to afford a vehicle.  Please redditors, if you found yourself identifying with some of the things that I have been through or understand what it's like to be unable to afford something other people had when they were teenagers, help me out if at all possible.

TL;DR: Went from being a dishwasher at minimum wage to attending the Microbiology program at my local University in two short years.  Got help from grandparents in putting me through community college.   In need of help in saving money for tuition and for my first car.  If I can't find some sort of help I will likely not own my first vehicle until I am about 26 or 27 years of age.  In a first world capitalist society this makes you about as desirable as a homeless person.

I would recommend only beginning to read this post if you have some time or actually care about other people's bumps on the road of life.  The goal that I am in need of help in completion is saving enough money so that I can not only pay the rest of my tuition for school, but ALSO be able to afford a car before I am 26 years old.  Here's my story: 

I attended high school in a highly affluent area.  We're talking the high school where students turn 16 and are bought a new BMW or Mercedes by their parents.  Having a large family, my parents obviously could not afford to do this for my four siblings and I, especially when they were in the process of saving money to put the five of us through college.  I graduated in 2007 and like most graduates immediately after high school was encouraged to go to college without taking time off to work or travel, or for health reasons.  So I did, and I went to a University that was about 400 miles away from home.  
Initially University was extremely exciting.  I began working out, making new friends with my dorm/suite mates, and setting goals for myself.  (I later found out that the dorm I stayed in produced the lowest GPA and highest dropout rate of any on campus housing due to its prison like appearance and being the only all male dorm on a massive campus).  During the course of my freshman year there, my parents failed to send me my depression medication on time every month (I was diagnosed as clinically depressed as a freshman in high school).  This lead to periods of deep depression which included feelings of hopelessness, periods where all I could do for relief was hope to stay asleep, and bouts of random crying/suicidal thoughts.  In turn, I began to miss my classes and perform poorly academically.  I even resorted to periods of drug experimentation, as a way of self medicating in an attempt to not constantly feel horrible.  

My sophomore year I found myself on academic probation.  My first semester I was so depressed I believed that I did not want to be in school at all, and took four F's.  The next semester I was on academic warning and told I would have to achieve a certain GPA to be able to continue attending University.  I fell short of that GPA by about .2.

The next year I was out of school, but living at home with my parents who have been fighting for about 30 years now.  (This is where I still live but I am getting there.)  I decided that it made more sense to move back to the town in which I attended University in as that was where my friends lived and where my girlfriend at the time was going to continue attending.  I said goodbye to my parents and moved back to Greenville, NC on my own with about $400 dollars to spare for finding a place to live and getting my first month's rent out of the way.  I rode there with my now x-girlfriend.

I found a cheap apartment to share with others and took a minimum wage job as a dishwasher in a Mexican restaurant downtown.  I was working 5 nights a week sometimes until 2 in the morning for minimum wage.  Yes I was scraping half eaten food scraps from the plates and getting recycling ""juice"" spilled on me when I took the trash out.  However, I had to work to be able to afford something that I wanted, and this made me happy.  I was glad that I had a new perspective and work ethic that many people I went to high school with will never experience in their entire lives.  (To this day my friends credit cards, cell phones, car payments, and insurance are still all taken care of by their parents.)  I made dirt money for hard work, but I continued doing it for a while as I had my girl and I had my friends.

After working and living in Greenville for about a year and a half, I had an awakening.  I was 21 years old, living in a crummy apartment, had no cell phone, and was working a dead end job to stay broke.  I realized that the only way I was going to make it out of this lifestyle of poverty I had seemed to have chosen was to move back home to Pennsylvania and get into community college.  There, I realized, I would be able to raise my GPA to the point where I could get back into a University again.  

At some point I woke up, and began being productive in some way every day.  I have come such a long way in just two years.  I am now 23.  I am living at home so that I have access to a vehicle that allowed me to commute these past few semesters. (My parents car.)  I recently graduated and got my associates degree in general studies from a community college with a GPA of 3.51 while simultaneously working most days out of the week.  Using my GPA and writing a letter of intent that had many of the details of this post, I was able to get accepted into the Microbiology program at my local University.  The money that I have been saving is going to paying my cell phone and gas money in commuting every day.  In addition, whatever money I save my grandfather told me that he would match, and we could put that sum together toward my massive tuition bill coming up in a few short months.  I received one grant for school and a good amount of money in loans, but the cost of tuition and books for University now is simply astounding.  
In October I will turn 24.  I will be attending University in a Microbiology program and have so many new opportunities and my whole life ahead of me.  Unfortunately, I may have to go five semesters in order to get my degree.  I will not be able to work nearly as much as I am going to have to be studying many hours every day.  This pushes off my projections of being able to afford my own car until I am about half way through my 26th year of life.  I don't wish this for myself.  I know that when I do eventually get a car I will appreciate it infinitely more than most all of my peers, but this doesn't make it any easier.  I finally wrote out my story as I have been wanting to document it, but I also turned to reddit for help.  Yes, life isn't fair, and everyone has their own problems.  I suppose I turned to reddit because of some of the amazing things I have seen everyone do over the years.  I'm sure that I will get plenty of angry or mean comments from this thread.  My goal is to be able to save enough for University AND a car, and at $9.00 an hr part time work this is realistically impossible.  This is my goal that I am in need of help with.  This is something that has been making me depressed for quite some time now.  I ask those of you who read this far, please help me out in realizing my dreams.  I don't care if it is advice, networking, or a small donation.  My paypal account is spl1014@gmail.com.  In addition to working part time I have also been selling items out of my basement on ebay, but even this is a tiny drop in the bucket of what I will need to be able to afford a vehicle.  Please redditors, if you found yourself identifying with some of the things that I have been through or understand what it's like to be unable to afford something other people had when they were teenagers, help me out if at all possible.

TL;DR: Went from being a dishwasher at minimum wage to attending the Microbiology program at my local University in two short years.  Got help from grandparents in putting me through community college.   In need of help in saving money for tuition and for my first car.  If I can't find some sort of help I will likely not own my first vehicle until I am about 26 or 27 years of age.  In a first world capitalist society this makes you about as desirable as a homeless person.

confessionaccount2,1246053366,/r/AskReddit/comments/8w1ia/i_cant_afford_a_therapist_and_need_people_who_can/,"Whenever I ask for advice about anything personal on the internet, the ""don't take anything seriously on the internet"" schutzstaffel feels the need to remind me of this. However, this is problematic for several reasons:

* Anyone close to me--my family, my friends, whoever--cannot be objective. Have you ever trusted your mother when she says you're attractive? 

* People often say things that are vague and useless, especially when giving advice. I like my friends, but I don't trust any of them to give good advice. ""Get over it"" isn't very helpful when you don't know how.

* If I could afford it I'd see a therapist or counselor, but I don't have the money for either. I went to a psychiatrist once and it cost several hundred dollars for a thirty minute session.

* This is about my girlfriend, and we've talked about it several times in the past. Nothing seems to work.

I always find that asking for advice in this setting gives the ""HAHA you posted something on the IIINNNTTERRRNEET"" crowd justification/rationalization for exercising their sociopathic behavior on me. Yet, for the reasons above I don't know of any alternative.

**Here is my problem:**

I go to a small college and am in a relationship with a girl who I will probably marry in the future. She's... not common, and the thought of losing her scares me. She's ridiculously intelligent (will probably go to an ivy league graduate/professional school), hilarious, averaged a 9.5 over several pictures on hotornot, is tech-savvy (she did a speech on fark) and generally charismatic. She's great, essentially.

What I can't get over and what scares me is how I feel about what she's done before we were dating, because I feel like if I don't get over this it could be severely damaging to our relationship. For the sake of both clarity and this story, I'll call her Bonnie.

Some time two months before we got together Bonnie was very drunk with a prospective student and some tennis player. Tennis Guy, I understand, was an object of competition for a lot of girls on her dorm hall. Since Bonnie wanted to be able to say she made out with the guy, she made out with the prospective student as well.

Eventually the prospective student suggested they leave and go to a shack. Bonnie, as someone who didn't want the prospective to do something stupid, went out of responsibility.

Once they got to the shack everyone took off their shirts and started making out. The prospective student started blowing Tennis Guy, and Bonnie, in her words, felt competitive over this and blew the guy to orgasm. After the prospective student realized she was cheating on her boyfriend, she had a mini-crisis and then... resumed fooling around with Tennis Guy. Competitive blowing ensued again and Bonnie again blew the guy to orgasm.

There are several factors that make this get to me:

**First**

Before I was dating Bonnie, I was trying to get her to be my fuckbuddy. We messed around, but we didn't actually have sex until we had feelings for each other. In whatever fucked up way possible, I feel like this isn't as much of a victory as Tennis Guy's, even though she's told me that she never was going to have sex with the tennis guy and that my victory was more substantial.

**Second**

I don't need to tell many of you this, but in Guy World having two girls do anything for you is infinitely harder to achieve than having sex with a single girl. I really couldn't give less of a shit who Bonnie has fucked in the past--it's the authority and status that having two girls compete to blow you connotes. It's like, ""well, I may have been able to seduce you but *this* guy could *quadruple* seduce you.""

It's entirely the status issue. I don't care about *actually* getting blown because most girls suck at it anyway. After a while, Bonnie has even told me that she's so confident in us that she's okay with me fucking other girls as long as I told her and she was okay with it. The thing is, I don't want to. She's ridiculously attractive and I doubt other girls would be as good of a fuck as she is anyway. I've considered staging a threesome just to make me feel better, but the problem is that *I don't feel like it's legitimate unless I didn't have any previous emotional involvement with the girls.* It's almost like I'm saying to myself, ""I can't possibly rule as hard unless I, through no other means other than being ridiculously attractive, get blown by two girls. Letting my girlfriend's feelings get me a threesome is gamesharking it and doesn't count.""

**Third**

I tremendously look down upon Tennis Guy. He's a fucking idiot, and if I met him I'd probably make fun of his stupidity to his face. That someone I am now dating could have lowered herself to compete for such an idiot slightly degrades her in my eyes. I don't know how to deal with someone so stupid being elevated to such a high status.

**Fourth**

Things that should make me feel better don't. The prospective student girl was fucking ugly. Moreover, his penis is a lot smaller than mine. And though there's an ideal range for dick size (about 5-7 or 4-8 if you're generous), his is obviously less satisfying than mine.

**Fifth**

When I think about how Tennis Guy achieved this, I feel like there's some secret edge he may have that I don't. Either by being more attractive, or more charismatic, or whatever. Part of me refuses to believe that. In all probability, he just got lucky because the girl was batshit and Bonnie is competitive as shit.

**Sixth**

I feel selfish as fuck. This happened before I was even dating her, but the prospective student was actually *with another guy*. I can't even imagine how he feels.

However, there's another even more dickish part of me that says ""well, that makes it even worse. He got this girl *to cheat on her boyfriend to compete to blow him* **plus** Bonnie. That makes him even more persuasive and possibly charismatic than if the slutty prospective student was single.""

**Seventh**

The hatred I've felt for this guy is immense, and I don't even know him. As I said before, a fair amount of girls were competing over him. This pisses me off, because they're not competing over *me.* I know that a fair amount of girls check me out, but that's irrelevant to me: that *he* was able to achieve that (or got lucky, whichever) and not some loser makes it all the more infuriating. I've considered ruining his life just to make myself feel better, though I don't because that's entirely uncivil and civil behavior is conducive to a functional, peaceful 21st-century society. No one should behave like that, and this type of thought is narcissistic as fuck.

Even worse, when Bonnie felt awful about it (and she shouldn't have), I felt like she *deserved* it; when she told me about it I felt like I forgave her even though *there was nothing to forgive. She didn't do anything wrong.*

**Eighth**

Perhaps worst of all, I know I shouldn't feel this way. She wasn't. Dating. Me. At. The. Time. This is what I keep telling myself. **It's illogical for me to feel this way.** Yet, I can't shake the six aforementioned feelings. When I read what I wrote above, I feel like Patrick Bateman. #7 is particularly unsettling; if anyone else felt that way I'd be quick to point out how they're being an illogical fuck but it feels perfectly okay to feel that way on my end.

When I've talked to Bonnie about this, she says that she felt bad about it and ""knew it wouldn't be that easy"". I've said that there really isn't a reason for her to feel bad about it because **it was long before we were even dating**, and that **I'm** being the irrational one.

I know I shouldn't feel this way at all, but I can't help it. I've spent days trying to get over this and it still bothers me.

Again, I can't afford a therapist and I really don't trust anyone to be objective about this, because people usually aren't and give awful advice. There's also way too much about me in here that I don't want any of my friends knowing; it would reflect badly on me and my image.

I want to share a bit of my life with everyone because I want to be able to reach out to someone who's currently having a hard time in their life. I assure you, you are not alone and your cries of help are being heard by me and many others.

Just a bit about me, Im a 2nd year college student currently attending a Cal State University. I have been on the Dean's List twice already and have a GPA of 3.45 ! It may not seem much to some people but I am insanely proud of where I am now. I could write a book about my experiences if I could, lol. I've had alot of my trust be put into jeopardy and people lie yo me constantly.  

I constantly told myself life would be easier if I didn't have so many health problems. I have a kidney disease, had two spinal surgeries (for scoliosis), asthma, and a bit of an esting disorder. I've suffered from all of this since I was born and I had to experience my high school and middle school to the best of my ability. I had my spinal surgery during middle school during 8th grade. I had to be put into home schooling to recover and when I tried to go back to school, i couldn't keep up with the workload because of the severe pains I was having. It tore apart my education and as an honors roll student I was so devastated. At the same time, one of my teachers would bully me. Telling me to go home and that I was too weak. She excluded me from potentionally life-saving educational opportunities that could have really helped me. She picked her favorite students and guided them towards their college goals while I was left wondering if she really liked me. I became severly depressed because of this.

I lost all my friends because I stopped showing up to school and they simply just stopped talking to me. They also made fun of my health conditions so yeah fuck them. I had to go to therapy because I was contemplating suicide and was so afraid to return back to school and face these teachers who said awful things to me. I was very shy and timid and was always taught never to raise my voice at my teachers so of course I stayed quiet about it. Until I broke down crying in front of my parents and told them that the teachers weren't giving me an opportunity to catch up on homework and give me the time of day to learn. I was in therapy for about 6 years. 

Then high school came, I was in and out of in-person schooling because of the pains and because I had my 2nd spinal surgery. No one called me up asking if I was okay. I spent my days on twitter, youtube, and tumblr learning how to draw, paint, write, and pretty much everything I could ever do. My home schooling teachers were absolute shit, they weren't even my teachers they just dropped off my school work and left lol. I had to teach myself Algebra 2 using just the book. I felt fucking stupid, but despite everything I still got honors roll. I complained about the discrimmination of students with health disqabilities to my high school and they ignored me. I would pass out in the hallways and the next day Id show up half dead because I dragged my ass to English class. The teachers would call me lazy and tell me I wasn't doing enough.

I wondered if anyone really understood the pain I was going through. Having to deal with depression and schooling at the same time was no joke. I unfortunately had severe anxiety and if my grade dropped lower than a C i would cry and pass out. I taught myself Math, History, English, literally everything in the fucking world. Because the support the school offered wasn't enough, when I asked for AP home schooling classes they denied me. I ended up being rejected from most Cal States and UCs because of that. I was so angry and frustrated, i felt humiliated in front of my peers. My Class Year had a 65% acceptance to UCs average. I felt completely lost.  The people I used to call my friends were attending Columbia, UCSB, UCLA, UCI. I cried so hard, it was impossible for me to feel better. 

Then I devised a plan to transfer to a UC in the future after spensing 2 years at a university. I entered the only Cal State that accepted me (I kind of regret it lol) and set the path towards my goal to transfer out. I wish someone in high school had informed me that I could have gone to community college and used TAG (transfeer admission guarantee). I had no idea that existed. My high school failed me big time. I guided myself where I went in life. I cried so many nights, and had no one to talk to. I felt compeltely alone and the help of my family wasn't much better either.

I've been volunteering as an ambassador for a charity for 12 years. (Not anymore) They took advantage of me when they tried to use me as a tax relief deposit in my first year of uni. They gifted me a BMW thst ended up being dog-shit. Like literally 250k miles, a bad motor, and a bad battery. And they wrote it off as a 5k gift to me in a tax form. I felt completrly betrayed but thsn I stood up for myself and refused to accept the car. I just felt so proud of myself for standing up against what they tried to make me do. It fueled me in my college years to keep going strong. I started studying more, looking up sources for CSU TO UC transfer. I still cried alot, but I felt at peace. I still dont have any friends but Im hoping to fix that one day. 

I applied for transfer to all UCs and USC for this Fall Semester 2021. I go waitlisted to UC Davis and UCSC for Political Science and I'm still waiting on UC San Diego and USC. It may not seem like much but the waitlist means the world to me to know that I am capable of going far beyond anyone's words and that my hardwork does pay off. I feel immensely proud of . Cal State Transfers are always last to be picked when it comes to transferring to another four year university so I literally jumped for joy at my odds defying everything I thought of previously. I feel like I can do anything. 

My parents were extremely toxic at some points and supportive in others. They have seen how much I suffered and I only hope with time they will realize that everything I've worked hard on happens for a reason. 

My depression and anxiety still exist, but I am hay to say I no longer feel that gut wrenching voice asking me if I even have a will to live. I still get severe panic attacks when I think about my rejection letters. I look back at my high school and middle school life and wish I was brave enough to face against the people who hurt me the most. I always promise myself that I will get past my hardships and hope to overcome everything I've suffered from.

Despite the lonely nights where I wish I had friends to play Valorant with or go to the movies with. I know maybe someday, i'll meet people who treat me nicely and support me. There's alot of paths I wish I took differently, but I can't change the past. I can only look toward my future. I know that life can be tough and you don't see yourself living past a certain point but everything gets easier with time. You don't need anyone but yourself to tell you that you're an amazing person and that you're capable of great things. You are an exceptional human being with great qualities and just because someone tells you something differently does not change the feelings you have for yourself. Your ambition is strong and it will drive you great places. 

No matter where you end up in life and if you decide to drop out, or continue your education. You are important and self-love matters. You deserve everything good in the world.",college,"I Found my Better Future and You will Find Yours Too (20, F )",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n10o6a/i_found_my_better_future_and_you_will_find_yours/,1619709977.0,can't pay for school,9.606666666666667
Motherfucked,1320145396,/r/AskReddit/comments/lwb2v/ive_been_screwed_for_four_years_so_far_can_anyone/,"I went to college the fall semester of 2007, and have not been able to go back since.  I'm basically begging for advice from anybody who can give it.  Most of my story is probably irrelevant, but I'll recount it here to best illustrate the situation.

When I graduated high school, I was living in the cheaper of the two motels in town.  An older cousin got me out of my mother's house when it became apparent to her that my mother was the cause of my rather serious depression, as well as a suicide attempt.  There wasn't anything legally allowing me to leave; she just showed up one day and told me to pack my things.  My mom threatened to call the cops, my cousin told her to do it, and my mom promptly shut her mouth and let me go.  I lived with my cousin and her husband for a short time, but when they traveled to Ukraine for a then-undetermined amount of time to sort out their adoption, it was time to strike out on my own.  So I did.  I had worked at a cafe in town since junior high, and had become the head cook.  I saved money and made pretty good grades.  I bought a car, found the cheapest place I could to live, and survived on the rest.  There wasn't much to spare, but I was content knowing that there wasn't anyone to hold me back anymore.

 I came to learn quickly that there is much more to getting into a good college than a passable transcript.  The primary barrier: money.  ""No problem,"" my guidance counselor would say, giving me piles of financial aid papers to fill out.  I accepted them hesitatingly, knowing that I was good enough to get into college, but not likely good enough to have anyone want to pay for me to go.  I dutifully applied for all of the scholarships I possibly could, and was rejected on all counts.  So, my counselor told me to file a FAFSA.  This is the point at which I became familiar with the laws of emancipation.  There are roughly 1,500 citizens of the town in which I grew up.  In general, not having somebody to sign my permission slips, or an address to which my letters could be sent was not an issue.  Anybody who needed to understood my situation.

 This was something different.  This was something for which I was required to depend on my mom.  Very literally, I was only legally allowed to be filed as a dependent of a parent.  In order to be able to file as an individual, I learned, a person must either have permission from a parent or be 25, married, or have a child.  Lacking these prerequisites, I did the only thing that I could - I asked my mother for help.  I was met with a resounding, ""fuck yourself.""

Obviously distraught, I turned to the one safe haven I had always had - my school.  When I did still live at home, going to school was what kept me sane.  I would immerse myself in it, and my home life would fade into the background.  My teachers were my friends and my friends were my family.  My English teacher even provided me with the mantra I still turn to: you can do anything for a little while.  My school came through for me again!  Without telling her which of her four children currently in the school it was regarding, the office called her and scheduled a meeting.  When she arrived, they gave her the forms to fill out.  In keeping with the appearance of a good mother that she thought she had established with the administrators of my school, she sat in the office scribbling for awhile, and then handed over the booklet.

By the end of the summer, I had found a house off campus that I had determined I could afford based on the estimates of the loans and grants I had been informed I would be receiving.  The school I had chosen was a 3-hour drive from where I lived, so I moved to that city a month or so early to start looking for a part-time job.  A short while before school was supposed to start, I got a letter stating that there was an issue with my FAFSA, and that I would need to provide tax forms to prove my parents' income.  I called my mother to ask her for the paperwork, and she laughingly informed me that there was no paperwork, and that she had written a zero on every line.

I tried to speak with people at the college, but no matter what department I took it up with, it was the wrong one.  All around, the answer that I got was that I either needed to provide the paperwork or the money, and fast.  To me, that meant either turning in my mother for defrauding the state, or magically coming up with thousands of dollars.  I had no credit and nobody to cosign for a loan.  Being 18, terrified, and entirely without encouragement, I gave up.  Finding a job that would work with my schedule was harder than I had thought it would be, and I ended up working overnights at Target.  Some mornings I would finish work in time to get to class, and some mornings I would not.  Sometimes I simply did not have the energy.  I was informed one day that one-third of the questions on a test I was about to take would be from things in the textbook that I had not been able to afford.  Knowing that I would have to drop out at the end of the semester, and not making enough money to even try to save, the days that I would make it to class started to get further and further apart, until it became a rare occurrence.  My grades evaporated, and so did my future.

I am only a little older, and only a little wiser, but if life has improved on me, it has made me bolder.  I am ashamed that I was stifled so easily.  I am ashamed that my mother's attempt to sabotage me was successful, and that I allowed it.  I did not want to pursue legal action, not knowing what would happen to my siblings still living at home, and not having a clue where to start.  I still don't, but now it is out of a desire to be a better person than she is.  The difference is, now I am willing to do whatever I need to.  I want to go back to school.  I want to be more than I am right now.  I have been working tirelessly since then at any job I can get my hands on, and there just isn't enough money to put away.  If there is no way but to work until this is paid off, that is what I will do.  Even then, if I am someday able to clear away what is, to me, an insurmountable debt, I will have a college transcript that shows that I have failed in every class that I have taken. 

I need help.  Asking for help is one of the hardest things I have learned how to do; right now, I am begging for it.  Who can I talk to?  What can I do?  Is there anything that I can do?  Is there any legal way to hold my mother accountable?  Learning is the one thing that has remained positive throughout my entire life.  When I was very young, my mother would punish me by making me stay home from school.  She would tell me that I would never make it to college, that I was too stupid and not well-behaved enough.  I would sit in my room all day guessing at what I was missing, reading ahead, and filling in my workbooks.  I feel like that little girl being told she can't.  Only now I don't even have the luxury of knowing that school will be there tomorrow.

If anybody has any idea at all what I can or should do, please help.  I'm desperate enough to be considering writing a letter to Oprah.

TLDNR: My mother intentionally made me lose all funding for college, and subsequently I dropped out and am stranded.  Please help.

I’ve gone my entire life up till my freshman year of college not knowing the true feeling of having friends, primarily due to my selective mutism as a young kid and later my non-verbalism throughout high school. Because of my terrible social anxiety, I grew to loathe myself. I often let my grades plummet throughout my childhood. It’s not that I wasn’t capable; school was a breeze if I actually gave two shits about paying attention or turning work in. I wouldn’t say I’m inherently stupid. It’s just that I lacked the motivation to do literally anything. I procrastinated to the utmost degree and never gave anything my all. I grew up in a constant depressed state and was prepared to end my life during my college years because I only ever saw myself as a failure of a person. For a long time I couldn’t imagine myself improving, and I’d convinced myself that I was destined to be that way for the rest of my sad life.

However, I miraculously proved myself wrong. I actually made a friend. By pure chance, I somehow actually managed to become close with a single person (let’s call her Elle) at my university. She’s fantastic, and spending so much time with her and becoming close with one another has really opened my eyes to how exciting having friends can be. However, I let my fears get the better of me these past two quarters. I was (and still am, admittedly) so terrified of losing Elle that I accepted every one of her invites to her dorm, during which we would always stay up till 4 AM. This was on a several-times-per-week basis. I went to every house party and every recreational event I was invited to by her. It’s not that Elle is a poor student in any regard; she’s actually incredibly on top of things. However, thus far she’s taken far easier and less demanding courses than I have, and I’d say I spend generally more time on my large-scale projects than she does. Regardless, I spend all of my time with her. I go to all of these things with her, not only to make myself happy, but also because I have a deep rooted fear that I’m going to lose her as a friend if I spend too little time with her, which is why I spend the most time possible with her. Maybe anyone would understand if this was their only experience with having and maintaining a friendship, but I can understand how most people would think of me as simply idiotic. From a logical view, I know that she wouldn’t mind if I took some time to actually focus on school, but I just can’t shake that fear and I don’t know how to.

Because of these time-wasting tendencies, I failed a single course my first quarter. I passed the other two with A’s, but the F really took a blow to my GPA. Second quarter, I’m fairly positive I failed all three courses. I haven’t received my grades yet, but I have a feeling I didn’t do well in any of them. First quarter was pretty bad since I couldn’t manage keeping up with all of my classes with my friend-invested schedule, so instead I put all my efforts into two classes while letting the third slip. Second quarter was an even bigger disaster, however. I’m usually a very punctual person, and being late to or missing anything has always been out of the question for me, unlike my friend, Elle. She‘s skipped a couple classes here and there for the sake of taking more time to complete work outside of class. One day, her own tendency rubbed off on me. I boldly skipped one of my design classes because I desperately needed more time to finish work for another. This turned into a habit. I began skipping more classes, and until two of my professors reached out to me about it, I had already skipped 2-3 classes per each of their courses. I had drastically fallen behind in all three courses, and it was nearly the end of the quarter. Because my stupid ass thought it best to spend all my free time hanging out with Elle during my final few weeks rather than catching up in my classes, I ended up staying behind in all of those courses. Second quarter ended a week ago, and I am so utterly terrified of what I’ve done, not only because I always manage to gradually ruin my life, but also because I now have to explain this to my parents.

My parents know that I’m capable. They expect big things from me. I was ecstatic during my first quarter and would constantly tell them how pumped I was to excel in my courses and finally get a strong start on life from here. I lied to them when I got my grades back for first quarter. I lied to them when I was struggling during second quarter. I told them I was okay. I wanted to appear responsible, ironically I suppose. My dad wants my first quarter grades back and has been pressing about it for months. I always tell him I’ll get back to him with them, don’t, and then tell him I forgot next time he questions me about it. I purposefully avoided calling my parents nearly as much as I did during first quarter because I feared my dad would ask for my grades again. Now that I’m stuck at home, I can’t avoid it. I’m going to have to spill the beans within the coming days and I’m mortified. I’m scared of disappointing my parents, and I know how much my success means to them. How do I go about telling them?

I know that I’ve effectively wasted a quarter’s worth of tuition, and I have nobody but myself to blame. I know that I’m clearly not prepared for college life and that I should’ve taken a gap year, like my parents had initially insisted, even though I hated (and still hate) that prospect. I started cutting again. I can’t stand myself right now. How does everyone else seem to balance their outside of school life and their school life? Why is it so fucking difficult for me to find that medium?

I don’t want to leave Elle. I don’t want to be alone again. I want this feeling to stay, but I think I already blew my chances. There’s only one quarter left, and my GPA is already down the gutter. I don’t think I can save myself. Either I’ll get booted from school if I can’t maintain a perfect A average this coming quarter or my parents will force me out. Deep down I want to stay, but I worry that I may not have that option.

The whole coronavirus outbreak led to my college dismissing the entire school for spring quarter. We’re doing online classes from home, and I’m confident that this could be my saving turnaround. I won’t have to worry about spending excessive amounts of time with Elle in person. I’m prepared to bust my ass off working hard. I want to achieve good grades. I really do. I want to do well in life. But simultaneously, there’s something deep down telling me that I’m lying to myself. I tell myself the same shit often, but I never come through. But I know that I have to come through this time, because the consequences for not doing so are too immense.

But what should I really do at this point? Where do I go from here? Do I accept failure, learn from it and continue to pass my courses with flying colors? Is it even possible for someone to bounce back from such failure during their freshman year? Should I transfer and sink into an even deeper depression? Should I give up on college? Or should I just give up entirely? Because at this point, I don’t see myself ever becoming a better person. No matter how much I want to be successful, I always end up screwing myself over and failing. I want nothing more than to die right now and I have no idea how to express that adequately with words.",college,I’m failing my freshman year of college.

[deleted],1330448372,/r/AskReddit/comments/q9v8x/im_19_and_im_depressed_i_really_need_help_what/,"From 16 years of age and below, I drifted through school trying to avoid everyone at all costs, I was bullied, I never understood the work I was given, always had an incredibly strict mother, had to deal with regular new ""Father figures"" with my single mum, had massive pressures put on me.

Didn't have any self esteem, I still refer to school as a period I didn't virtually exist.


By the age of 16-18 I started going through college, where I at first managed to become very sociable on a ground that I now had new foundation to start my life... 
Until I started to understand the social struggles and consequences of getting involved with people.

I noticed I was still rather left out, that I didn't have a voice people would listen to, that I'd often see a whole group of people do for someone else.

So I drifted from groups of friends to others, finding similar results, I was never rude, I could sometimes consider myself a little too kind, kind to a fault. (Sorry to sound big headed!)

I learned in often small doses it was fun to hang with people, I became well known, got close to people (though, only through me generally helping them at some point)

Throughout my college years, I kind of learned I had to put a vast majority of my effort into other people to maintain any recognition, if I stopped, I vanished, if I carried on, I'd reap in small reward, but often felt used, or exhausted as people over time forgot about me and moved on with their lives.


Girls are a major issue, I've had a common issue of believing that despite my words and effort being great, it only holds better value coming from the mouth of another man, which in turn, left me ""friendzoned"" by many girls, some of which I'm pretty sure were aware I liked them.
I completely stopped attending college, I didn't talk to anyone, I just vanished. 



**So, from 18-19, I managed to do something with myself, I got myself a job as a computer engineer, and also as a sales representative, working both on a 7 day a week schedule.**

I got myself my own house, my own stuff, I finally left home from my always seemingly disappointed mother, and even during that, socialised with masses of people at work (held benefits talking to strangers on the street), and for a first, a sense of pride.

I was finally being me, happy, energetic, random, spontaneous, outgoing.
I met someone important (we'll call her... Emma for the sake of saving identity) at a party I got dragged to by strangers (I helped drunk strangers to a house party, they insisted I come with), had a superb time, got along brilliantly with Emma, who was strangely enough 23, a massive age difference... 
To me at least. (I'm only 19)

We kept in contact, we started seeing each other more, finally kissed, so on so forth, went out, quite ""couply"".
I couldn't be happier, my first ""relationship"". Met her brilliant friends, got to meet new crowds, got to live a different life clubbing, going out. Expensive yes, but worth it? FUCK YES.

Saved her friends life (and mine) from a house fire! (Must have sealed the deal with me and her?)

Then it started to go wrong...


One job didn't pay me on new years. (Computer engineer)
I had my other job on the third of January (sales), I needed money to get a train to work.
So the days go by waiting, unable to get contact...

Call up my Computer engineer job asking why they didn't pay me, found out I got made redundant, and my pay was being held (still to this day)
I lost that job.

20 minutes later, I call my other job to explain I couldn't attend as I couldn't afford to travel.
They fire me over the phone, in half an hour, I lost both my jobs.
A week later seeing as the rent was due, I lost my house.

My bike later gets stolen whilst with Emma, I move back in with my mother, I'm now broke without money.

The insecurities kick in, I start to doubt if Emma likes me, I start to feel the little heavy waves of emotion dragging down my back as I begin to notice I'm getting depressed, again like my past.
I was not in a good place, after a few weeks, things start going rocky with me and Emma, mostly my fault however. Though, she was rather shy and reserved the whole relationship, only now I couldn't control my thoughts.


During this rocky phase, I talk to an old friend, let's call her Jennifer, a girl I'd crushed on for 2 years, even moved cities to see her, however I in the past didn't consider going out with her, due to her consistent ability to screw me over, or ignore my efforts, even at one point going out with someone minutes, MINUTES!! after telling me she liked me (a triumph of a moment till I saw them making out -Yes, my life is full of these stories), so yeah sorry, she said she had liked me the entire time, was dreadfully sorry for how she treated me, in tears actually, and felt I'd friendzoned her going out with Emma...

You know, after all that's going wrong, I start to consider doing the worst thing I would have ever done in my life: I thought about leaving Emma and all those doubts, and be with Jennifer, someone I liked for so long...

Long story short, in the midst of a massive state of being upset, I sent a text to Emma saying she didn't have to talk to me if she didn't (after considerable times she failed to respond any more... :/)

So, she called it off (she was sincere)... Something I was kinda expecting, though, didn't want.
My first ever genuine heartbreak now too..

I talk to Jennifer, and she friendzones me, again destroying me.
Her stated reason is to sort her mind out, which is understandable to a degree, but to rub it in, she's now trying to go out with someone else... And in the midst, I hear from another friend of hers that she tried again recently, so I kind of don't wish to talk to her much, despite the friendship we've had now.
Now, by this point, I'd also had my new phone destroyed, my slr camera stolen, had my new job start date cancelled, overhear how my mother thought I was pathetic choosing a job I wouldn't be secure in, years of emotional neglect from girls, friends, with the ongoing thought that the week after, would be valentines day, a day I've spent alone my whole life.
I just couldn't take it any more, so -Yeah, I tried to kill myself, unsuccessfully however.


I lost contact with people in hospital for about 4 days in hospital.
Friends did get concerned, and only through a lot of sincere heartfelt messages of people changed my mind and mentality.
Since, I've been drifting generally doing nothing, just applying for jobs, hoping I get somewhere.

And sadly, I miss Emma, we've drifted a lot, Emma understands she did appear to ignore me for a bit, but only through her ongoing issues...

I wish I could just talk to Emma normally again, even get back together... though, I doubt it.
I just miss her affection, I cared so fucking much, something I've spent my whole life trying to gain from someone, something I waited in return after spilling mine oh so mindlessly onto people :/
Just, I don't know what to do with myself, I'm scared of girls, I hate living at a home with a constant disappointed mother throwing all offence she can at me, somewhat more annoyed at being down, drifting from friends.


I feel I don't have anything to live for, any time I've got myself to a high point, I've crashed down harder.
I'm at a loss, I've not even explained (despite the essay) half the troubles or complications.
What do I do? :/

Thank you so much for reading, really!
Kind of expect (TL;DR)
Feel free to ask if you wish for me to clarify something.

andizzyg,1608146140,/r/college/comments/kefppd/how_to_make_in_college_2020/," ***How to make $ in college*** 

**#1: Use your skills.** There are tons of people who want to learn something that you know how to do. And they are willing to invest some cash to learn something new. Use this to your advantage. Whether that’s being a coach, painting instructor, guitar lessons, whatever you are good at. Give it a try and it's great because work will revolve around your schedule. Plus you won’t have a boss to tell you what to do all the time. A way that you can get started in using your skills to your advantage is by making flyers and putting them in the places that relate to your skill and by posting on your social media that you are starting to give lessons and if anyone may be interested in. It is a good start and your clientele will only increase over time. And given that there’s low-key a pandemic going on… perhaps just try your lessons over Zoom and charge less. 

**#2: Become a tutor, TA, or use a Work-Study job**. This will not only get you a check but it will also help you relearn important topics covered that will help you out on any standardized tests that you may need to take. and when you aren’t busy you are able to do work on your own Homework. It’s a win-win situation. Just try and apply for the job and it's great because your employers will understand that you are in school and will help you prioritize your school work and can be flexible with your work schedule.

**#3: Sell your shit**\- That piece of jewelry that you bought 2 years ago and have only worn once is not a necessity. Use Apps like eBay, letgo, Goat. One man's trash is another man's treasure. There probably a whole variety of things that you own but you don’t use any more. So remove your emotional attachment to that one thing that you actually forgot about and never use and please sell it. 

**#4: Become an RA.** Most people pay to stay in the dorms. You are getting paid to have a room by yourself, close to campus with the only drawback being the slight responsibility. However, college students are adults and most are smart enough to not do something that stupid in the dorm setting. Instead of paying for rent, get paid for rent. 

**#5. Sell Class notes.** If you have taken a class that is notoriously tough for many students. I would suggest gathering all the notes that you have taken throughout the semester and making them in pdf of some sort and sell the flash drives to students who are willing to pay. You can promote these notes by making flyers and using social media. You’d be surprised how many people would find value in this so if you are good at taking notes…why not make a profit off it?

**#6. Be a Designated Driver.** The truth is that it could be hard to find a friend to be the DD and sometimes your “DD” ends up drinking more than you do. Also, Uber’s could really get expensive and we college kids are broke. So if you decrease your fee as a DD and promote your service in the university setting, you’re going to get tons of business. Just make sure to keep a trash can in your car with snacks. 

**#7. Uber Driver.** Now if you don’t want to go the independent DD route, you could just become an Uber driver as you set your own hours and can work whenever you please. The good thing about this is that Uber is quite established so people would probably be more likely to trust it. People will always need transportation and if you have a car that’s halfway decent then use it to your advantage. 

**#8: Do Cheap Haircuts.** Haircuts could be expensive. I myself spend around $25 every 3 weeks on a haircut. If you can offer the same or similar quality of haircut and perhaps decrease your charge, I almost guarantee you’re going to receive clients. However, your work has to be quality because your barber can really decide how fresh you looking in front of the ladies you know. All you need is some clippers with various clipper guards and scissors. But please sanitize your blades…

**#9: Dog sitting.** If you are obsessed with dogos .. then this is the gig for you. There's an app called Rover and you basically just take people's dogs for walks and just take care of them. This shouldn’t even be a job because I would honestly pay the owner to hang out with their dog. Definitely look into it if you’re interested.  

**#10: Vector Marketing.** I used to have this job and it's basically just trying to sell Cutlery to people you know and whether you sell anything or not you get a base pay of like $16 per appointment. It’s totally all on your own time. I worked a total of 15 hours and earned $230. So it wasn’t bad at all. 

**#11: Facebook ads**. Perhaps you guys have heard of this but Facebook ads are basically you reaching out to a business to promote them using Facebook or Instagram. If they accept, you will receive a certain percentage of sales, or whatever their terms are. A lot of businesses are struggling right now and are trying to adapt to stay afloat but simply don’t have the knowledge, resources, or workforce to help them. It is very much like the evolutionary quote “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most **adaptable** to change.” So if you can help these businesses adapt to the current change, they will defiantly be offering you a pretty penny in return. 

**#12: Dropshipping.** Okay, I'm going to make this simple. You buy a product cheaply from a wholesaler and sell it for a higher price and you pocket the difference. But your quality of the product may suffer along with shipping time to the customer. This could result in refunds. 

**#13: E-Commerce (Amazon).** Similar concept as Dropshipping except you receive your customers products in advance and you are more in control of the shipping time period along with the quality of the product. If you do this over many products, you are going to start making some good monthly income. 

**#14: Investing in stocks** (Give run down on stocks). Okay so investing in the stock market may seem like gambling to some and honestly let those people think that. The stock market is very predictable once you start comprehending trend patterns but the biggest mistake many investors make is that they don’t do their research so they end up losing. Now you don’t have to be a full-on day trader to make some decent money in the stock market. If you do some initial research on a certain company or business and their overall trend pattern has been increasing then the stock may be solid. Defiantly look for stocks that are reaching higher highs and higher lows. I’ll leave some links in the description box below that are helpful videos to get an idea as to what the stock market is and some things that you should know before investing. Now you may lose some money as you ride the roller coaster but you will not only make it up but will double your money in the long run. I won’t get too much into stocks cuz there is quite a bit to know before you start investing but a good introduction is using something like Robin Hood or Acorns to slightly invest your money as you use spare change to invest money with. Just to clarify I am not a stock market specialist, I am just advocating that stocks can be very profitable and can be a solid means of income for you but invest at your own risk.

**#15: Youtube.** Now, this will be quite sometime before you’ll be making some good money with this but once you hit that 50k subs, your Channel will really start to grow and gain you some passive income. Plus it's just fun af.

[deleted],1335235965,/r/AskReddit/comments/spbul/reddit_today_at_work_i_ran_into_my_mothers/,"I want to apologize in advance for the length. I didn't want to miss anything.	

	Before I tell you about today, I'd like to give some background information to show exactly why I hate this man so much.
	After my parents' divorce, my brothers and I lived with my dad. So when I was about eleven, my mother started dating this horrible man who we'll call Bob Bobbington. He wasn't horrible from the start. He had a good first impression for about  six months, and he seemed to like me a lot, as I am the only female child in my family (it's me, a younger brother, and an older brother), and he said he'd always wanted a daughter.  Bob had a well-paying job and seemed to be able to care for my mother perfectly. After about a year though, we started to notice that every single weekend we went to visit, bob would start drinking beer at early hours of the day. He was always drunk. But he wasn't abusive. Yet. Next, we noticed that he'd start drinking hard liquor like vodka and rum. That's when he got abusive. Every weekend was the same. he would get pissed off and throw things around for the smallest reasons and he was constantly yelling. When he got too close to one of us kids, my mom would step in and try getting him to calm down. It never worked. That's when he started hitting her and threatening her with items from his expensive knife collection. We'd spend hours locked in rooms just to get away from him. When we went home we'd tell our dad about all of the shenanigans and he called the cops. They did nothing. My father gave us the choice to go and see our mother or not. We decided to continue seeing her just to make sure she was safe—and while we were there, we kept her as safe as we could. My brother who was fifteen at the time had even ran bob out of the house by threatening him with a knife after he broke my mothers nose. My mother suffered from several concussions, broken ribs, nose, fingers, and more. One weekend, my mom was trying to get her car keys from bob because she didn't want him driving drunk. He held the keys behind him to keep them from her. But i, standing behind him, snatched the keys and threw them to my mom. Bob angrily picked me up from my shirt and threw me into the glass coffee table behind me. I was rushed to the emergency room, and from that point on, my father banned us from going to see our mother. 
	In the next six months, my mother's life was completely ruined. They were evicted from their home because bob spent rent money on booze and drugs. My mother lost her job at the daycare because bob would come in and was an obvious threat to the children. And no one in town would hire bob anymore. My mom and bob moved two hours away to live with my grandfather and thankfully, after two weeks of them being there, my gramps kicked bob's ass to the curb. 
	After that, none of us saw bob again. My mother got a new job, declared bankruptcy and is rebuilding her life. She is now engaged (with the best person in the world) and just bought a house. We are very close now. Shes doing great and I'm so proud of her.
	For a while all I would think about is what I would do to Bob if I ever saw him again. But as the years passed, I thought about him less and less. 
	I am now sixteen and work part-time at a clothing store to save money for future post-secondary school.
	 I went to work today, working on the till. I kept conversations with the customers but also kept aware of other parts of the store as we were short staffed. That's when i saw bob. Waiting in line. I don't know why, but I kind of wanted to serve him. The moment I saw him I recognized him. 
	As I was finishing up with the customer before him my heart started pounding because I knew I would have to talk to this man that I dreamed about confronting so many times. I've dreamt about what I would say to him if I'd ever see him again but I knew I'd never have the guts to say anything to him. When he came up to the till my heart was still pounding but I wasn't scared. He smelled exactly like he used to. Old spice and Irish springs soap, with a hint of alcohol. I continued with the routine welcoming ""hello, how are you? Did you find everything you were looking for?"" he answered back politely and didn't seem to recognize me. ""you look familiar,"" I told him. He smiled and said, ""yea, I have that kind of face. A lot of people say that."" I continued scanning and then said ""is your name Bob Bobbington?"" he said, ""yes actually, it is."" I wanted him to know that I knew who he was and everything he'd done to my family. I wanted him to feel guilt and remember all of the horrible things he'd done to the most important woman in my life. I wanted him to feel uncomfortable knowing that I knew a bit too much about who he was behind his ageing face and smiling facade. 
	""oh, you used to date my mother,"" I smiled slightly. He laughed a bit and said,""and who is that?"" he didn't recognize me. I look exactly like my mom and he didn't recognize me. I looked up from the till and said my mother's name. his eyes widened as he began to recognize me. He looked me over and I knew he knew who I was. ""oh! How are you?"" he asked. He seemed slightly uncomfortable. That was what I wanted. ""I'm good, how about you?"" he replied that he was good an then said, ""how is your mom?"" ""she is great,"" I said. ""she's engaged and she's very happy.""  I wanted to show him that she had moved on and is amazing and completely perfect and happy without him. ""oh, that's great,"" he said. The woman standing next to him shifted a bit and he remembered her presence. ""uhh, this is my new girlfriend,"" he said her name as he motioned to her, but I forgot it immediately. What struck me most was that she looked remarkably how  my mom used to look. She was short, with long brown wavy hair. She had a round face and she was chubbier. She was huddled in sweatpants and a sweatshirt. She looked to be completely aware of his presence. As if she was constantly prepared for a rebuff. She looked insecure. But she seemed like a very kind girl. She smiled so kindly and sheepishly said ""hello."" I wanted to yell at her to get away from him because she looked so innocent and much too young to be hurt by him. I didn't want him to hurt anyone like he'd hurt my mom. Instead, I smiled and said hello. He began asking about my family and school and what not. He seemed to want to keep polite. He paid and then left. 
	I don't hate people but I hate him. I hate that man more than anything else in the world. It took everything I had not to reach over that counter and grab him by the neck. I wanted to scream at his face and make him feel every bit of pain that he made my mom feel. I wanted to feel his bones break and watch him scream. I'm not a violent person, but i will never forgive this man for what he did. After he was gone I looked at my coworker and told her I needed to get a drink. I went to the back and just started crying.  

TL;DR: can't punch assholes at work.

So Reddit, my question to you is: Have you ever wanted to confront someone but couldn't for certain reasons? (like what happened to me).  I look forward to reading your responses!",AskReddit,"Reddit, Today at work, I ran into my mother's abusive ex-boyfriend. Have you ever wanted to confront someone but couldn't for certain reasons?",http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/spbul/reddit_today_at_work_i_ran_into_my_mothers/,1335257565.0,school is too expensive,9.24
rosa1200,1491169880,/r/college/comments/632ihk/need_advice_on_whether_to_drop_out_of_college/,"I study psychology at a relatively well-known university in central London. All throughout high school, I dreamt of getting a place there and being able to study there. My mother was very supportive, but my father had always wanted me to study medicine (and perhaps go into psychiatry as opposed to psychology). I felt as though I wasn't passionate enough for going through with medicine (or maybe even smart enough?), and so I chose psychology. According to my father, this was to be a sort of 'trial-year' for me; if I liked it, I would continue, but if I didn't, I would perhaps stop and change to medicine. When I finally got the offer and the conditional score, I was overjoyed.
However, my first year at university isn't exactly going as well as I had hoped. I struggled a LOT with myself in general, my low mood, my uni work etc etc. I started seeing a university therapist in November, and this past winter was incredibly tough. Some weeks I couldn't get out of bed, I would sometimes go for days without seeing my friends and just isolating myself, and I lost quite a lot of weight because of it. I would cry frequently, and even though my friends were incredibly supportive, I wasn't as happy as I knew I could be, and that was frustrating. I loved the friends I made, but I knew I could make better ones, I was always jealous of seeing other people bond together so well and I kept telling myself perhaps in 2nd year, I'll join more societies and get to know more people and find a group of friends I 100% 'click' with.

When I went home over the winter break, my father would continuously ask me what my plans were after I graduate etc etc. Thinking about my future always makes me feel incredibly anxious, so that conversation would always end in a fight or in tears (on my side).

It's not that I didn't have fun. Weekends I would drink with my friends and go out, I've met countless people at my halls - perhaps more of the sort of friends you drink and party with, but I loved them nonetheless. Living in central London was the most amazing opportunity ever, and there always something to do.
However, even as months went by I couldn't motivate myself to do study or do well academically. I would always half-ass my assignments and turn them in last minute, and my mood wasn't getting much better, either. Maybe I wasn't as motivated because I wasn't sure if it was 100% the path for my future, maybe it was the lack of complete support from my father...I don't know, but things just felt off .

And then something awful happened. I won't get too much into it, but in February I was sexually assaulted by a friend. When something like that happens, it takes a bit of time for your mind &amp; body to process what had happened. I spent the next few weeks afterwards just getting drunk constantly. I wasn't aware of it, but I was in a state of emotional shock for a few weeks before all my feelings hit me like a fucking train. I suddenly couldn't stop crying, I was in a constant state of distress, I felt worthless and violated etc etc. I just felt like a glass of water that was a tiny bit overfilled, like my tears would creep up on me in public when I'm ordering coffee or sitting in the library. I felt like a mess, and even walking through the street, I felt like people would look at me, I felt like my sadness and distress was leaking. The only person I've talked about this to is my therapist (can't really tell my friends as they are also friends with him and all), but he (the therapist) is being extremely sensitive about the whole thing so we've never really talked about my feelings about it thoroughly. My academic work got even worse, I had to get extensions for everything, and I even stopped eating completely for a few weeks just to regain a sense of control. A couple friends knew something traumatic had happened (not what though), and they would come check up on me etc, but I can tell they're not really sure how to deal with it all either.

It's spring break, and I decided to fly home to spend a couple weeks here. It's been a couple months since it happened, and I'm doing relatively better. But not completely okay, though. I feel a bit out of control, like my mind is really sluggish and slow. I don't know if it's because of what happened, because I feel fine, really...but then when I think about it too much I start to feel a bit distressed. I just still feel a bit 'off'. Like a bit far removed from myself. Exams are coming up and I don't know if I'm making myself feel all this now to give myself an 'excuse' not to study. I can't motivate myself to study, and it all seems a bit hopeless.

I've been thinking recently that perhaps I should drop out of uni after my first year. All in all, I love my school and my friends and all, but I just feel like I need to figure myself out a bit...I feel a bit lost, I feel very confused about everything, and I feel as though perhaps I'm not mature enough to fully appreciate it all yet (?). I feel as though my first year was a bit wasted in a sense, and I see all my high school friends having so much fun and I had to deal with shit and it just makes me so...upset &amp; frustrated.

However, as its April, it's too late to apply to any other university - if I were to decide to do medicine, I would have to reapply next year (for 2018 entry). So I would take a year off and then apply when I'm 21. For medicine, that would still be minimum 6 years of studying on top of that. Plus, I'm not sure what I could do in my year off. On top of that, medicine is a lifelong commitment. Of course, my future would look far more secure and promising than a future with a degree in psychology, but I don't know how to know if its the right thing for me. I feel as though perhaps putting ALL my life energy into medicine would finally give me a sense of purpose, but I'm scared I'll regret it. I'm scared I'll drop out and quit this amazing school and throw away a good opportunity. But I can't ignore this gut feeling, I can't ignore the fact that I just was so genuinely unhappy in my first year. I should also point out that this psychology course wasn't exactly something I had been expecting, perhaps? It's interesting but I can't get myself to care enough. Psychology has ALWAYs interested me, and I know deep down that psychology/psychiatry are written in the stars for my future. I can't imagine doing anything else. But I can't motivate myself for this year. I just don't care. I feel apathetic. I don't know why. I don't know what to do.

I don't know how to tell if I'm completely healed from what's happened (I don't think so..?), I don't know how to tell if I'm okay with anything, it's like I don't know myself anymore. I can't stop crying every time I think of this whole thing about being confused, and I feel so utterly hopeless. I don't know who to talk to. I'm scared of talking to my parents about it, as I know they'll probably support me leaving, and I don't know if I'm ready for that..? I don't know what to do. I feel weirdly numb.
If you read all of this or even ANY of this, just know that I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I'm just an angsty and confused teenager I guess, and I know I need some proper guidance. Any help or words would be really, really appreciated.",college,Need advice on whether to drop out of college (first year) or not... *long*,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/632ihk/need_advice_on_whether_to_drop_out_of_college/,1491191480.0,lack of emotional support from parents in college,9.193333333333332
MealsOnWheels,1284672276,/r/AskReddit/comments/dew96/reddit_im_broke_and_need_a_new_wheelchair_if_i/,"I've had this wheelchair since my first years in high school.  I'm 28 and still using the same frame which doesn't fit me anymore.  My seat cushion is busted and provides zero support.  The feet plate are bent up and the material used for the seat/back is torn up.  I have private insurance but I can't even afford the deductible ($1250) nor the %20 I must pay once the deductible is met.  I live on my own, so my mobility is key which is why I really want an ultra lightweight wheelchair but the lighter you get, the higher the price. I estimate that my out of pocket costs will end up somewhere in the $3,000 range after all customizations/features are taken into account when getting a new chair.  My back is killing me and at this point, would love nothing more then to get a new chair.  I had my eyes on [this](http://www.topendwheelchair.com/Everyday-Wheelchairs/Top-End-Crossfire-Titanium-pid30.html) model in particular.  I'm flat broke so I thought about selling ads space on my wheelchair.  So reddit, if I went through with it, would anyone on reddit be interested?

        
For the curious, here is a picture of my [antique chair](http://imgur.com/oT0Mp.jpg).  The bitch in the picture is my roommates dog, snatch.  The most awesome pit bull in the world.
     
     
Update:  For anyone curious as I'm sure this will come up..[This is me](http://imgur.com/0zuiJ) and I have cerebral palsy.  A quick shout out to Zach!  You are awesome!  
     
     
Update #2:  This seems to be moving up rather quickly so just in case this keeps up, I am looking into a paypal account for anyone interested in helping.  I'll post an update with the information when I figure out what I'm doing.  Thanks everyone!
     
     
Update #3: I was going to setup a new paypal account for the sake of my own privacy, but what the heck, I'll just use my [personal paypal account](deleted and no longer needed thanks to reddit!!!). Since this is reddit and things can get crazy, quickly, let me apologize if I don't get back to you right away. I'm getting lots of comments/PM's and I am trying to get to everyone.
Thanks to all of you for your help. Reddit really has me stunned and amazed right now. You have no idea. You rock!


**Update #4:  I've got to take a break for an hour or two but I will be back to reply to everyone.  I promise I will personally get back to each and everyone who was so kind to help.  So far, $400 has been raised!!  Reddit, you truly are a miracle to behold.  I can't say thank you enough.  Be back shortly!**

Reddit, I'm back!  It's starting to look like I'll need a small army soon.  This is so amazing.  So many comments, PM's and emails to go through but I'm slowly getting through the backlog.  **You can bet I will be snapping a few pictures if this new chair becomes a reality.**  You are all amazing!

**Update #5:  Reddit, I'm in shock.  $1800 so far!  I can't believe this!  I'm almost in tears...  I'm still trying to get back to everyone.  Please be patient.  I just took a flexeril, my bones and muscles kinda hurt so if I don't respond, I've probably passed out for the night but I will be back as soon as I can.  Bless all of you!**

Update #6:  I just woke from my slumber and its 2:00AM CST.  Holy S*@$*&amp;!.  Stop sending money please.  You've all collectively sent $3463.17.  More then enough to get a dream wheelchair.  I never expected this in my wildest dreams.  I know how many posts reddit churns through everyday and how much content is probably never seen.  But what started out as a silly thought, something of a daydream that I thought no one would pay attention to turned into something real.  Only a handful of you (and I mean a handful) asked for ads which really blew me away and I am in shock....I'll be calling a PT tomorrow to get the ball rolling and I'll be sure to post pics of the new chair soon and keep everyone up to date on things.  Reddit, again, thank you.  You are amazing.  I honestly can say this is the best thing that I've ever had happen to me.  Back to bed.  I'll continue responding to everyone in the morning!  Goodnight reddit!

**Update #7
Awake to a new day!  I went ahead and removed my paypal account as so many of you were able to help so much more than I could have ever imagined.  I called my family and told them the news.  I also requested a 1/2 day off from work today so I could spend more go through everyones emails and fulfill any ad requests and start calling/contacting the proper medical peoples to get the ball rolling on a new chair.   You can be sure pictures of the new chair will be posted.  It may be upwards of 6-8 weeks from start to finish but I'll make sure to keep everyone updated on its progress!    I love you reddit!  I love you reddit!  I love you reddit!  I love you reddit! Again, thank you so much!**

**For those who would like some reassurance that I am who I say I am, I'll gladly contact whoever is in charge at the reddit batcave.  Is this possible?**

Update #8:  Because mom's will be moms, here are some childhood pictures for your enjoyment!  About 1/2 way going through all the emails/PM's.  Hopefully I'll be able to finish up responding to everyones messages by sometime tomorrow.  Thanks again reddit!  And yes, I was a major nerd.

**Click [here](http://imgur.com/VwjYo.jpg), [here](http://imgur.com/zu4Uk.jpg) and [here!](http://imgur.com/IFqaN.jpg)**  Notice my current wheelchair in the first picture, when I was around 15.  The chair really is that old!  I really can't wait for a new one!!!  :) Oh, and the good looking lady in picture 3 is none other than my mother, better known as IKnowHimWell.

Update #9:  I ended up spending most of the day with mom so I apologize for the lack of updates and responses to all your emails/PM's.  It's been such a wild ride but I wanted to spend some time relaxing with friends and family over the weekend. She and I both are still pinching ourselves!  Hopefully over the next week I'll have some accurate measurements to post up for those who kindly offered additional assistance in getting demo chairs for me to try out.  Reddit, thank you again from the bottom of my heart.  

** One last note.  [I saw this article and wanted to bring it to reddits attention](http://abcnews.go.com/US/dad-loses-cool-threatens-students-bus/story?id=11660119).  Unfortunately, I was in this poor girls shoes as well many times throughout school so I feel her pain.  Bullying happens often, but is rarely acknowledged or resolved via school officials.  I'm sure my mom would find it surprising that I had to deal with bullying quite often and until this post she probably never knew about it.  Please educate your children and be active in PTA/school board meetings about these kinds of issues.  Reddit, you've done so much for me already, but if you could help push this to the front page I would greatly appreciate it!**

Update #10:  It was a busy Monday at work but I'm back to give everyone an update!  I've got appointments setup to be measured for the new chair so I should have more details for everyone by early next week.  My insurance company (or at least the rep I spoke with at UHC) was so nice to point out that I may not be able to get the exact chair/features I want strictly because UHC reserves the right to approve or deny coverage based on what is most cost-effective so I am preparing myself for that if that should happen.  It's sad isn't it?  It's things like this that make me wish I was born in another country but thats a whole other can of worms :P  I received a few thousand emails/PM's combined (no joke) so please, if I haven't gotten back to you yet I apologize.

Idrawboobsallday,1332228367,/r/AskReddit/comments/r4syj/dear_reddit_i_come_to_you_today_to_tell_you_about/,"Hi, I'm a 22yr old male, please don't immediately leave because I don't have boobs! I know I know, my story would be more appealing if I was a woman, but cut a brother some slack. This is also my first time posting on reddit, so I APOLOGIZE IF I FUCKED UP EVERYTHING EVER.

I will try to keep this short and hopefully I won't just sound like some airhead wallowing in self-pity. I'm going to start with a little background so as to help understand my current predicament. 

When I was 13 my mother lost her job and couldn't afford our house anymore so we moved into the large two sided guest room of my grandparents house. Jump to 3years later, my mother went missing for 2days and stumbled into the house so drugged up she could barely stand. I didn't understand it then as I do now that the stress of dealing with my grandparents for those 3yrs caused her to have a breakdown and turn to hard drugs. They threw my mother out the following week, about 3months into my freshman year of high school, I didn't speak to my mother again for almost 6yrs. The Next 5yrs I fell into a serious video game addiction with world of warcraft, trying to hide myself away from reality, seriously my play time on that game would make a no lifer vomit. 
Anything to get away from listening to my grandparents constantly argue, listening to them berate my mother to me, my grandfather constantly demanding the most idiotic things from me. I learned quickly not to ever try to refuse anything he tells me, **too best describe my grandfather would be; A violent and destructive toddler throwing a temper tantrum whenever he doesn't get his way.** My grandmother constantly told me to do what he says because of what he did to his two sons. The first son was schizophrenic, he put his head through a wall and violently beat him, then threw him out on the street when he was 16 and he was homeless for 30yrs before being takin to a medical facility where he killed himself a few months after my grandfather visited him. The second son left at 17 and has never come back. I've seen every little thing from leaving a drink on the counter, my grandmother taking our dog to potty, or him being corrected in any way result in him having a violent temper tantrum which will usually go until he breaks a door or some dishes and my grandmother threatens to bludgeon him to death with a skillet which i also feel is the only reason he has never actually struck me.. don't get me wrong, he has tried. He's also an alcoholic which doesn't help. Anyway moving on, focused alil on my grandfather as I would call him the **antagonist** of my life so far. 

**Now, the results of all this crap combined over many years:** I estranged and lost all my friends, I gained +70 to obesity, I constantly skipped high school and flunked all my classes for the full 4yrs graduating only because of a program initiated in my final year where If you passed the GED you gained a HS diploma, within 2yrs of my mother moving out my hair completely thinned, now I look balding, my barber keeps asking me if I'm under stress.., I'm completely estranged to the rest of my family, I can't sleep most nights without something to knock me out, otherwise I will spend all night obsessing over death, whether it be just dying or killing people, which makes me feel like I'm going insane, either that or my heart will race and I'll feel very twitchy all night, I've had days where suddenly it seems like everything will just hit me at once and I'll feel too weak to stand and cry uncontrollably for an hour or two, I live in absolute terror of my grandfather, I've been in fights, I don't live in a good neighborhood, No man has ever scared me and I have too much pride to back down, but that 50yr old man throwing a temper tantrum scares the living shit out of me, and finally, while I've thought about killing myself, I believe suicide is weakness so I avoid doing it. 

so yea, I think that about covers it as far as my issues go, I make no excuses for anything and accept that most or all of that is my own fault.
If you're still reading I apologize for my overuse of commas, I failed literature class, just sayin.

So when I was about 19 going on 20 I finally broke free of my video game problems, it was hard, the first week i couldn't get out of bed. 

They would not teach me how to drive until I was 19. I've never actually held a job, I have no work history, for all those years my income was from selling virtual goods(because when I couldn't do shit on my WoW account, I did shit on other people's accounts for $$$)and my grandmother would split her pay with me to help her on bigger manual labor jobs. When I got my license my grandmother helped me purchase a car for $700, I don't drive it very often because she drives it all day everyday and also because some days I feel like if I get behind the wheel I might ram my car into a pole to kill myself. 

I've spent the last 2yrs trying to find work in my area which is very difficult being a 20something yr old with no job history, some made up referrals(I have no one) and a total lack of a vehicle. I'm not a smart man, but I'm honest and I'll do the work I'm paid for to the best of my ability. All my interviewers do is ask me questions that make me believe they think I'm some moronic thief.

**Getting to the point**
I cannot take another day of this, I have reached my limit(8yrs is my limit apparently). I'm too old now to spend every day of my life afraid to wake up later than my grandfather, even on days I do not sleep, because he will come into my room and throw a temper tantrum because I am asleep, yes shit like that has resulted in me staying awake for multiple days at a time. 

I have never told anyone about my home life, not even my best and only friend knows, this is the first time I have ever talked about it.

This morning, March 20th, I am packing up everything that has value to me, loading up my trunk and leaving in the pouring down rain. 
Anything I leave behind my grandfather will destroy.

It feels like I woke up from a coma 2yrs ago and remembered why I fell asleep. 

I think I'm running away from my problems, I think I'm a coward, I hate myself almost as much as I hate him, but I don't know how to deal with a violent toddler in a 50yr old body, so I don't know what other choice I have.

I have nowhere to go, I have ideas but that's about it, I don't have any understanding of the real world, I've been locked up for a long time. so all I'm asking is for any piece of mind you can give me, any advice, any tips, maybe a place to go, the sky's the limit.

I'm just a man looking for something better than what I have and if you could so kindly give me some direction, I would greatly appreciate it.

Its possible this is the first and last time you will hear from me, my car does not have internet, just saying.


**TL:DR my mind is full of fuck, I'm making myself homeless to get away from the fuck, advice about how to survive would be cool.**

also any psychologists out there feel like diagnosing me based off this, that's cool, i couldn't afford sit on your weird chair/couch/thing anyway.

goldenoutline,1329807716,/r/AskReddit/comments/pz1fe/i_need_help_now_i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,"I don't know if reddit is the place for this but it's all I have right now.

I have a pretty good life. I live with my dad and stepmom in a suburban area, I have friends, I go to a pretty good high school. I'm not really bullied or anything, and nothing that terrible has happened to me in my life. My sister attempted suicide in in 2007 and 2009, and I have possibly been [sexually assaulted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/po4u4/can_the_human_brain_really_black_out_disturbing/) in the past, but aside from that, trauma in my life has been minor. 

I have seen many different counselors and therapists throughout my life, from 2006 to early January this year. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 2006 and also diagnosed with depression in 2007. I took ritalin for a while for the ADHD, but other than that I haven't received medication.

I feel like I'm insane. I can be so normal and upbeat and happy and then I'm suddenly just so depressed and suicidal. I've never attempted suicide, but I think about it daily. I talk myself out of it because I love my family and friends and could never do that to them and after watching what happened with my sister, I know better than to resort to a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". I've heard it all. Like I said, I've had all this counseling and stuff in the past and I get it.

I don't know how to describe how I feel when I'm down. I feel like no one can even understand what's going on in my head no matter how hard I try or desperate I get. I feel like all my parents and counselors see is an emotional teenager. When I become depressed, it just happens. Not suddenly out of nowhere, but gradually becoming worse and worse without anything to really have brought it on. My whole body feels depressed and all I want to do is curl into a ball and sleep. Even if I try to sleep, I'll lay awake for hours just thinking about everything that's wrong with me: my personality, my looks, my priorities, my brain, etc. I was just sitting on the couch today after having a great time hanging out with my friends and I thought about how much I'd like to stick a gun in my mouth and just blow my brains out, or maybe jump off a bridge so there's less of a mess. I wake up in the middle of the night screaming into my pillow and sobbing and I have to lay down and cry for an hour until I'm too tired and have to go back to sleep. I want to tear my skin off my flesh and pull my hair out of my head. I eat so much sometimes and suddenly I can't eat at all. I feel like I'm screaming on the inside and my throat closes up to stop from screaming on the outside. I feel like I'm literally insane and I don't know what to do with myself and I don't know who to tell, because I don't want people to think I'm crazy. I care more about how people see me than anything else and I have to punish myself when I feel that I've embarrassed myself; I'll dig my nails into my arm until I bleed, bang my head against the wall, or bite into my fist until my nerves are begging me to stop. 

Nobody knows any of this because, like I said, I don't want people to think I'm insane. I think I have bipolar disorder and I've shared this with my parents. My grandmother had bipolar disorder and I've heard it's genetic. They don't see any of my bipolar or whatever it is that's wrong with me; they only ever see me in my good moods. I think they think that I just get down sometimes, as everybody does, but I over-think it and the more people deny it the more I think I'm right. I guess it's easy to think that I'm being an over-dramatic teenager that self-diagnosed and wants to be different and unique and have people care about me. Maybe that's what I am. 

I need help. I talk myself out of suicide every day but I don't think I can do it much longer. I've been calling the crisis hotline more and more frequently, and all they ever do is tell me to see a counselor. I've seen counselors and sometimes they're good, sometimes not. It doesn't matter. My parents don't really believe in mental disorders, they just think it's society putting labels on everything so they can sell more drugs. I've gone through this before. I've tried to get help. They just won't go for the medication and they've started to use money as an excuse. I'm too scared to press for it because I feel like they think I'm being selfish because I really am a selfish person. Instead, they tell me to exercise and eat healthy and do a bunch of other stuff like that. My therapists always recommend stuff like that, though my last good therapist really did try to get me professionally diagnosed. Apparently it's a long, tedious, expensive process, and I just don't want to be that sort of burden. But I really don't know what to do now because I feel like one day I'm gonna have a really bad down and I'm just going to kill myself. 

I don't know if I'm explaining any of this right at all, it's really hard to put everything into words because I'm having a pretty huge down right now. Please comment with feedback or questions to better understand what I'm trying to say.
I just need some advice on what I should do right now because I feel really hopeless.

I know there are going to be people who feel inclined to comment saying ""suck it up"" or ""kill yourself"" or tell me how a lot of other people in the world have it much worse than I do, but honestly if you could just resist that urge it would be wonderful... I'm literally begging. If you don't have any advice that you legitimately think will help me, don't give it. I'm in a bit of a dangerous state right now and I guess it's stupid of me to post on a site like this asking for help but I don't know where else to go.

TL;DR: Possibly bipolar or insane, parents don't believe in medication. Counseling doesn't help. What do I do?

**Update:** I wound up talking to my stepmom about it this morning. She's arranged for me to see a doctor on Friday so we can all talk to him and see what our options are. She seems to sort of understand because she says she went through a time in her life where she had an anxiety disorder and could barely leave the house, along with depression after her mom died. While it's not entirely the same situation as mine, I guess it just helps understand what I'm going through a little better and feel a bit more empathy. My dad, however, doesn't really understand it and as much as she'd like to cover up, I've gotta say he's being a pretty huge dick about it. But that's okay. I just wanted to thank you all for talking to me last night and I don't know if I would've finally worked up the courage to talk to her about it if it weren't for you guys. Now things are finally being done about it and that's all I can ask for.
Also, there's a community athletic center a few blocks from my house, and my stepmom is purchasing a key so I can go there to get some exercise. I guess that'd be good for me and might help improve my mood, plus I've been needing some exercise anyway. I might be skinny but I'm not healthy.

[deleted],1326238641,/r/AskReddit/comments/obip7/i_dont_know_how_to_effectively_communicate_with/,"So, my parents split when I was about 10. I lived with my grandma, grandpa, dad and 2 sisters for 3 years, in a one bedroom apartment. It was crowded, there was no privacy, but I think those were the best years of my life, minus the year my grandpa died. My dad used to do my hair, and I used to play a lot of video games with him. My dad's kind of like me. We can disappear into our TV/monitor for hours, and we're very weird when it comes to our feelings, or expressing them, I guess. 


When I was 13, my mom found a suitable apartment for us(her, my sisters, and I) to live in. I was with her on weekdays and with my dad and grandma on weekends. She used to go clubbing a lot. And she worked crazy late hours. This went on til I was about 16. Then our landlord went bankrupt or something, sold the property and told us we had to move out. My older sister was already out living with her boyfriend. My younger sister and I went back to my dad's and grandma's. My mother moved in with her boyfriend. We didn't see her much, she said it hurt her, but I honestly didn't think so. 


I've grown to resent my mother. I think she's a terrible mom and thinking back, there are things I would have done differently. And I always wonder why she didn't do them the way I would have and the only explanation I have is that she didn't care about us enough. 


So, I'm 16. My dad starts dating a 19 year old. He is 35. The 19 year old convinces him we, his daughters aged 14, 16, and 18, are old enough to not need our dad in our life actively. They move to another state. I am crushed, I feel rejected and unloved. I begin to resent my father as well. Everyone tells me I am selfish and he deserves to be happy. Now, my little sister and I are living with our grandmother. 


Now, I'm 18, little sister is 16. My mother finds an apartment, but in this time has had 2 other kids. She comes to my grandmother's house excited about finding a new apartment. It's a 3 bedroom. One for her and her BF, one for the 2 toddlers, and 1 for my sister and I who now both have boyfriends and different interests to share. I say fuck that, I'm staying with my grandma. I talk it out with her and she agrees. So, now I live with her. 

**TL;DR- After years of a messy adolescence and already sort of living with her, I finally officially move in with my grandma.**


Everything was fine. Then, my older sister got evicted and came to live with us in our (remember, one bedroom?) tiny place with her kid and husband. At this point, I was spending most of my time at my BF's house because I my home was now crowded again. Every time I came home, I fought with my sister because she would use my things with out asking. I thought it was already bad enough that she's invading my living space, but now she's using my stuff. She would leave her son with my grandma every night and come home really late. That would make me very mad and I would tell her. We fought a lot. My grandma didn't like it. 

So, my sister was supposed to stay with us temporarily, but 1 month turned to 2 years. So, now I am 20 and I find an apartment for my grandmother and I that we can afford. We leave my sister and her family in our old place. I hardly talk to my grandma and she is 73. I hardly ever talk to her. I just use the computer and play video games. Sometimes my friends come over. She watches her novelas and that's all there is to our relationship.

**This is the important stuff**

I'm 22 now. 

I'm not perfect, and I have done some pretty shitty things, but she accepts me, or so I thought she did. I found out she kind of hates me and I am a burden. I didn't know she felt that way. It could be because I never talk to her, but she never really talked to me. As I stated above, I am really weird about sharing my feelings with others. I hate hugging people. And I just don't know how to be compassionate. I see her sitting in her room sometimes just staring at the floor, and IDK what to say to her, so I walk into my room and use the computer. 

She recently took up watching my mother's children, but she is old, doesn't do a very good job, and the kids are fucking terrible. She is abusive to the children. She has hit my brother in the head with a drumstick (from Rockband) because he wasn't eating fast enough. I can't see that and not say anything. So, I told her not to hit him for no reason and that he is a child and she needs to be more patient with him. I've also heard her calling them names, really bad names, in Spanish. Things that would make me cry. So I've told her that kids aren't born knowing how to respect, and that we have to teach it to them. IDK what she got out of that conversation but she turned it around on me.

She told my older sister that I constantly undermine her authority and I disrespect her, and that I told my mother she abuses the children. I did no such thing. I never spoke to my mother about the abuse because I know my grandmother really needs this baby sitting money, all I did was try to stop the abuse. My mother found out because my brother, who is 8, told her. 


So, she's threatened to kick me out. I haven't added that my boyfriend lives here too. He got kicked out of his house last year because his parents found out he was smoking. So, I asked her if he can move in with us. My grandma and I split the rent 50/50 and I pay all the other bills with my boyfriend's help. She has a foodstamps card with $120 in it monthly, which she has also threatened to take away from me. 

If my boyfriend and I could move out we would, but we just don't make enough money. I get into a lot of fights with my sister because she says my BF and I take advantage of my grandmother. We don't. All we do is live here. We take care of all the bills, we buy food($120/month isn't enough for 3 adults and 2 children), and we buy all the toiletries. My grandmother has never been more comfortable in her life. 

**I don't understand her problem with me and I don't understand how to talk with her in a way that isn't disrespectful because anything that defies her is already disrespectful no matter how gentle I lay it down.**


**The big problem, I think, is that everyone in my family is extremely old school Hispanic. Like, I have to respect and never question my elders no matter how wrong whatever they're doing is.** 


My father broke up with his girlfriend a little over a year ago, and moved back-- next door to us. Since then, my grandma has been cooking for him EVERY night, with the food I buy, and doing his laundry. I don't think any of that is okay, especially because he contributes absolutely NOTHING to this house hold. I've said it before and it puts me in a shit storm of trouble. So, I've learned never to comment on that topic. 


I've never cared about establishing relationships with my family, but looking back, they've never reached out to me either. The only times we talk is when we're fighting. We've never been close.

Throwaway01298734,1457677269,/r/socialwork/comments/49xih9/really_need_some_advice/,"I am a social worker in what is like a nursing home (SAR) in a hospital that does a lot of charity. This is my first job out of graduate school. I was offered a few jobs but this one paid the most and is in an excellent hospital. The description seemed like it was right up my alley.... Caseload is around 28 people, mostly elderly. Patients range from end stage cancer to just got a knee replacement. Discharge planning, case management, some therapy. We also get a lot of homeless patients and undocumented  immigrants. I discharge around 60 people a month in a very impoverished city. This nursing home is kind of the ""dumping ground"" for patients the hospital cannot discharge but don't want to charity any longer. 

This all sounds fine and dandy and honestly I am very good at what I do but... I am expected to carry almost all of the non nursing workload on the unit. I do many things that were not in the job description and there was no one to train me on the new position. Just some examples, too many to
list: I have to get insurance authorizations for people to come in, I have to be the one who gets people's stays extended by working with insurance companies (these insurance pieces are very very time consuming), I run pharmacy benefits checks for the docs (also very time consuming, sometimes ) I order equipment (but the therapy team makes no efforts to give me information on what equipment is needed, I have to seek it out, which is tough for that many people. I've tried establishing a system with no results) I set up home care and outpatient therapy, I arrange for iv antibiotics (which is a mess, the docs don't want to be bothered with this and I'm not a nurse with that knowledge so getting this together is sometimes a challenge and the docs often change the dosing hours before discharge and won't communicate with me) discharge dates change a few (2-3) days before they are set to leave, which means I can do very little to no planning in advance and have to literally scramble to get insurance extensions, the communication is very poor and I'm the one looked after to enforce what management wants (""they aren't doing enough therapy, they have to get out tomorrow!"" That's fair but therapy hasn't even brought this up, the patient has no idea, this is also against cms regulations, it's unethical to give that little notice) patient's family members call and ask about medical care and the calls get forwarded to me (nursing or the docs can't be bothered with it) I have to tell them that's outside of my scope of practice and they get very upset. 


I've stated in our morning rounds meeting I need a little bit of help and the DON actually laughs at me. This has happened more than once. It happened this morning and a new ""student nursing volunteer"" approached me in the elevator and told me it made her sick. My administrator tries to be supportive but she's only there very part time. I field around 40 phone calls a day on a light day (no exaggeration. I have to charge the phone during lunch) The receptionist sends most misc. calls my way (someone looking for info on where to park, for example) even though often times they are things our admissions coordinator or reception should answer, they just won't. 


I consider myself a pretty smart and hardworking person. I've been working since I was 15 in some capacity. There is no teamwork on this unit and it's honestly too much work for someone to do in a 40 hour workweek. They truly need two social workers because many of these people are so medically fragile many cases are incredibly time consuming. I'm often there late even when I work my ass off from am to pm and I ""work smart"" The doctors call and text me nonstop even in the evenings sometimes. I have asked them to cool it but some of them take out their frustrations on me, like all of the bs that goes on is somehow my fault (it's not, I'm tired of constantly having to make that clear)

Homecare and iv infusion liaisons bombard me nonstop (daily) looking for referrals. I've asked them to stop showing up unannounced but it doesn't stop. I've asked reception to ask them to make an appointment but ""that's not their job.""


The cherry on top: I have 200 hours of pto and can't use any of it. There is no one to cover, I'm the only social worker. The social workers in the main hospital have tried to fill in for previous social workers on my unit but the job is nothing like what they do, they don't deal with iv antibiotics of getting group 2 support surfaces covered, etc. they mainly just do referrals. I've never taken a scheduled day off. The unit relies on me so much not a soul can or will ""do what I do"". If someone needs ambo transport or a nursing home referral when I'm not there they have to call me. These are doable tasks and I've tried educating others (reception, admissions, nursing ) but they just state ""it's not my job"". I'm the third social worker in as many years. 

My life is miserable, the stress is so high. I don't carry home sad stories or cases.. I'm actually very tough and I enjoy being able to help people navigate through medical emergencies.. I carry home the worry that patient x needs to leave by tomorrow but his insurance takes 10 business days to approve dme and I wasn't given notice of his discharge until Tuesday... Or patient y wasn't declared hospice eligible by the docs until she was basically incompetent  and the family wants answers and all calls go to me.. Or patient z decided she's discharging to Texas with a cousin at the last minute and I have to order complex dme in Texas in just a day because she already booked her flight and no one notified me.. Even though we meet as a team daily. And I have to get the hospice patient out by Friday as she's been cut by insurance.. 


This post doesn't do the job justice. I cry in my office weekly. It's only been 9 months. I'm completely turned off from social work. I try not to let anyone see me cry. I've never been this depressed in my life. I tried to take off next Wednesday.. Well, a half day... I won't know if someone discharging Wednesday with iv antibiotics until Tuesday night and no one can/will set it up for Wednesday discharge but me so I can't take off now. I'm in desperate need of dental work and I was going to go to the dentist. 

I can't leave. I have so many loans to pay. I live in a very high cost of living state and rent is high. I can't believe I went to school so long to be this unhappy. I am so turned off from social work I am afraid to get another job. I do have a Lgsw license. I have had many many internships, part of me knows it's not all this bad but I'm afraid of being trapped like this again. I know if I leave this job too soon it will look bad and I need those recommendations to get a better job I'm going to have to get on depression medication because I can barely get up in the morning. 

Just looking for some advice. Should I stick it out? Should I continue to try and improve things? What would you do? Am I just a whiny baby? I'm embarrassed to be one of the ""social workers that didn't stick around long"" but I can see why they don't. 

I do have a sw supervisor but she isn't much help as she does not work on the unit. ",socialwork,Really need some advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/49xih9/really_need_some_advice/,1457698869.0,can't pay for school,9.013333333333334
helpwithletter,1331766875,/r/AskReddit/comments/qwx07/help_with_writing_a_persuasive_letter_to_school/,"Hi Reddit. I tried posting this in R/Writing, but got no responses, so I've dragged my sorry ass over here hoping I won't piss too many people off for posting in the wrong subreddit and maybe to get some help.


This is kind of a long, convoluted story, but I would greatly appreciate it if any of you would take some time to read, ponder, and possibly help me with this dilemma.


Basically, I need some of your writing expertise to create a well-worded, persuasive at best and guilt-inducing at worst letter to a few members of my university's administration (background story to follow). I am not a terribly great writer, being a chemistry major, and would love some help with formulating my argument and making my jumbled, angry and helpless thoughts more viable on paper.


Anyway, here's the background story of my shitty situation that I'm hoping to appeal to administration.


My university has an extremely strict 'no alcohol/visible intoxication allowed in the dormitories' policy. I know that. I've had it drilled into my head for the entire time I've lived on campus, and so I know that I was an idiot when I let a close friend from out of state come visit me for the weekend and party her face off with some other mutual friends. I did not go out and drink or party as I had several exams coming the next week. When she came back for the night (she was staying in my room since she had nowhere else to crash), I let her into the building and we were stopped by resident advisors because she was drunk and had in her possession an almost empty bottle of alcohol that she didn't finish from earlier in the day. Long story short, my school can't charge her with anything because she goes to a different school, but I am being charged (under the university's judicial system, not actual state law) with the use/possession of alcohol solely because she was my guest and I am ""responsible for her actions.""


The consequences of my sentence are:
to have a permanent mention of the incident on my university transcript/record.


the requirement of completing an alcohol education class that costs $200.


and letter sent home to my parents (really worried, since they disowned one of my siblings for switching to a ""useless"" major. not sure what they'd do to me if they found out I'm going to have a permanent blemish on my school record and waste $200 on the class)


I have met with three judicial and resident life advisors, and although they all agree that I am an excellent student caught in an unfortunate series of coincidences, it boils down to:


A rule was broken, and someone must take the blame (me).


When you have a guest, you are completely and utterly responsible for that guest's actions.


I'm not trying to dispute any of their reasons for charging me with the use/possession of alcohol. I've asked and pleaded for a couple days now, and the bureaucracy is having no ifs, ands, or buts. They all say the same thing- ""We're so sorry, and we wish we could help you, but...nope.""


I've all but given up hope at getting the charge lessened (I asked to be charged with 'in the presence of alcohol,' which only entails writing an apology essay), because even though I wasn't directly to blame for alcohol being in the dormitory, I am forced to take full responsibility for my guest's actions.


The part I am now trying to dispute is the fact that I have to take the alcohol education class. Not only is it a financial burden, but more importantly, I don't think that my punishment fits the crime. The alcohol education class was created with the intention of teaching students the adverse physiological, psychological, social, and academic effects of drinking. I already know all of those things. I'm a chemistry major with a 3.8 GPA. I could draw the mechanism for the metabolism of ethanol on the administration's foreheads blindfolded. What makes me the most upset (read: OUTRAGED) is that everyone I have talked to keeps telling me that they would love to help me, but they can't. I've asked over and over again why there aren't shades of gray in the school's judicial system, but they all say that there are set parameters and I fit in them and will be punished the same way someone who got shitfaced and blew chunks all over the Dean's desk is punished. In my mind, there is nothing judicious about that at all.


Sorry for rambling for so long (can you tell I'm a crap-assed writer yet?), but I'm finally getting to a point, I promise.

There is an alternate, free course on decision-making that I feel would more rightly fit my situation that I desperately want to take instead of the alcohol education course. My goal is to write, hopefully with the help of your eloquence, an emotional/persuasive letter to any and all of the administrators in the judicial affairs and housing branches at my university to allow me to take the decision-making course instead of the alcohol education course.


I don't have many points thought out yet, other than ""fuck RA's,"" ""fuck administration,"" and ""I want to crawl into a corner and bawl my eyes out,"" but the two viable points I think I have are: 

1. Administration is supposed to help students and encourage them to learn from their mistakes. No one is helping me, but is simply shoving my case into a thousand others which are completely different from mine and then referring me to the next supervisor. 

2. Judicial Affairs is supposed to sentence me with something commensurate with my crime with the goal of helping me learn from my mistakes. I would gain absolutely nothing from being forced to take an expensive alcohol education course, and it would cause me significant familial problems and lesser financial problems. There is nothing in there that indicates that I would learn from my mistakes and grow and become a better person because of what I did, which was essentially to let a drunk friend who needed shelter for the night into the dormitory.


So...that's all I really have going for me in my letter so far. It doesn't really pack the punch I want to get someone to listen and help me. I know my chances at getting the current charges reduced are basically none, but I just want to be able to voice my anger at an administration that claims they want to help students learn and grow as people, but don't want to deal with helping me ""learn"" at all, and to possibly persuade someone to realize that I shouldn't have to take the alcohol education class because it serves no purpose to me but more to their set of rules and their coffers.


I apologize again if this all sounds like a jumbled mess, but my brain has been exactly that for the past couple of days.


And finally, my original plea:


Could anyone help me formulate or organize a persuasive argument that guilt-trips the administration into giving me the ""proper"" judicial punishment? I was thinking of just editing and rewording a lot of what I have written above, but tweaking it so that sounds as nonaccusatory, but effective and persuasive as possible.
Anything, such as a brief outline of talking points I should definitely mention to help my case, how the flow of the whole letter should proceed (like giving my background story, guilt-tripping, then begging for mercy, then signing off respectfully), or advice on certain phrases/word choices/quotes I should use, would be insanely appreciated.


I'll attempt a TL;DR too, in case someone/everyone is turned off by my ramblings


Because of bad luck/timing, university is charging me with use/possession of alcohol even though I neither used nor possessed alcohol, which entails an expensive alcohol education program. I don't think that is fair and am poor and would rather take a free decision making class instead",AskReddit,Help with writing a persuasive letter to school administration over judicial affair?,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qwx07/help_with_writing_a_persuasive_letter_to_school/,1331788475.0,school is too expensive,8.986666666666666
darkarchang3l,1491195796,/r/college/comments/634qnr/transfer_college_success_tips/,"I honestly don't regret the CC route. I have found my niche and am positive about the direction I am headed. I was not active in HS (did NHS, arts club, dance club, APs/IB english, but none of that leadership overachieving nonsense haha, had avg stats blah blah blah)


You can apply anytime for cc but it's better to apply early asap and do orientation if you want to early reg to take all the classes you need esp if you want to do it in a specific time frame. My cc has a program with hs seniors where if you complete the early program, you get priority reg for 1 year. If you complete the Summer Advantage Program, you get 2 yrs priority reg. I work at outreach so we specialize in catering to hs.
Depending on your major, students at cc take around 2-3 yrs to finish ge's and major prep (if stem then focus on major prep). CC is also good if undecided cuz it allows you to test the waters. You can take classes that you want to try and not worry too much about money.


Bae Factors:

-Assist.org

-Counselors (multiple to get diff perspectives, make ed plan that maps out classes you’re going to take)


-Transfer success center (they are ahmaazing): workshops, one on one appts with uni reps, uni tours, transfer fairs, help with apps and questions about the transfer process. Keep in touch with them from day 1. They have the info on transfer agreements (TAG, TAP, H2H, Special agreements with local campuses)


-Go to the damn office hours and even talk to the professors outside of the class/office.

--Get to know them and let them get to know you on a deeper level. I have met the most amazing professors during my time here. My econ prof has a PhD but he has a passion for teaching and my English prof is hands down amazing :) 

--You’re going to need references esp for scholarships, jobs, schools (private, grad, etc.), advice, etc.


-SCHOLAR-FREAKING-SHIPS and FINANCIAL AID

--&gt; if you have applied for fafsa, YAYYY!!! You are on your way to freee moneeehhh :D Apply every year preferably right when it opens. Honestly though, Finan Aid Office, Student Placement Office (Jobs on campus), and Scholarship Offices are keeeeyyy. Look into CC's that offer scholarships to Freshmen in the Fall. Like. HOP TO IT. We have a Buy-the-Book Scholarship cuz them textbooks be dammmm expensive.... Board of Gov's Fee Waiver is legit. BOG is across all California Comm Colleges though. It waives the unit fees, so you don't need to pay per unit.


-Career Services

--&gt; may host finan aid and job workshops, etc. They help if you are unsure about what career path you want to do and can even help with resumes and finding jobs on/off campus.

-Workshops, Programs, etc.

-- Stay aware of the different types of workshops that are offered. This could be bulletins, emails, classroom announcements.


Campus Involvement

I was really big on this for 1.5 years. (was zero involved first sem but got a 4.0 lol that sem) ASG (student gov), ICC (interclub council). Clubs (make your own club if you want), Honor Societies (I am prez of Phi Theta Kappa), etc. Like legit tho. I was basically everywhere. I was commisioner for ASG-went to the meetings=got to know students and faculty. I was also ICC rep spring 2016. This gets you on the email lists so you stay the first to know what events/opportunities are happening. (went to SSCCC conference this way) Conferences are also a great way to know other students and faculty from other CC's. You can find your diff fams at school. I basically know most of the faculty, staff, and students. It's good to be recognized esp for rec letters (SCHOLARSHIPS, private unis, jobs)

--Networking is key. Legit all about the connections.

-Outside Involvement

-- Pursue what you are genuinely passionate about or relates to your major lol. I prefer the first option. Explore, learn, create. Don't just build up your resume but also build up yourself.


-Internships are hella bae

--I regret not pursuing an internship (summer or during school year) This provides invaluable xp particularily in the field you want to study. You can also use this to figure out if you like it or not

--also networking opportunities


-Honors Program
UCI Honors to Honors Progam -- if your CC participates in this, then you get automatically into UCI CHP with 3.7 gpa and completion of H2H program. Honors Program also opens up research conferences like HTCC (Cali) where you present research at UCI (I was moderator 1st time and now presented research just yesterday lel) RESEARCH IS HIGHLY STRESSED ESP IF YOU PLAN TO TRANSFER TO A RESEARCH FOCUSED UNI/COLLEGE. You don’t have to pursue research tho so do what works for you!


-Job (if you plan on working pt/ft) –
I worked at Outreach Office p/t. I got hired as a student ambassador (found out about position through the emails) and then qualified to be a Student Ambassador (fanceh, huh?) I honestly LOVE my job. I get to educate students on the college process through application workshops, finan aid wrkshps, college fairs, etc. I wouldn't mind working OT. We do tours for elem, middle, hs, and others. --money and xp -what a great combo lol


-Student Life and Leadership
Again, they host events, workshops, etc. We have Student Leadership Institute that is in conjunction with CSUF (also accepted) where you basically get certified as a leader after completing a bunch of workshops. I did this and was on the committee the following sem.


-Programs and Services-

-Extended Opp Programs and Services

-Disabled Students P&amp;S

-CAMP

-Veterans

-more (it's late lol)

-If your CC has a first-yr support center, that is GREAT

-My CC offers free basic skills classes (excel, adobe, word) and even certificate programs (marketing skills, graphic design, etc) open to public.


If you pursue the CC route, really get to know the college and what they offer. I know this might seem like a lot, but there are so many services that are offered only to benefit YOU, the student!!


Tips:

-Getting involved on campus only benefits you through exploring your likes and dislikes while figuring out who you are. Once you get involved, build up your rep and word spreads quickly and you might land yourself on some recs/offers. Even PR might like you a lot.

-Business cards are hella handy.

-For every hour you're in class, plan on spending at least 2-3 hrs outside of class for study/review/hw/etc if not more.

-Positivity is key, at least, in my philosophy. No, seriously. Postive energy is infectious. I was an introvert when i first started, but I have found that I can be myself with limited judgement (people don't want to be mean to me lol)

-Not everyone you meet is going to be your best friend. There are those select people who will stay with you your entire life. Keep them.

-BE THE MOST PROACTIVE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. I was not proactive at all my first sem and missed sooo many opportunities...like scholarships... 10000000% effort and proactiveness lol

-It's not possible to be everywhere and do everything without crashing. Balance is key. and tea. Tea is soothing.

-You are not me and I am not you. We are all unique and have our strengths.

-Getting a BA is not everyone's goal. CC's offer certificates

-Do the RESEARCH. Scholarships, internships, programs, everything.

-Whether you are at a uni/cc/college, your experience is what you make of it. You could go to Stanford and do nothing. It is really what you do that counts.


Welp, I hope this helps a bit. If you have any questions, pm me. I wish you the best in your endeavors ! (gosh, that is overused so many dammm times but it's inclusive enough)


=major hugs for you and everyone!!! &gt;w&lt;= (I respectfully apologize if you are not a huggy person...here's a =high-five= instead :D)


Have a beautiful day/afternoon/evening!

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on an Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with an something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry because I wished something like this would've happened to me in high school or something, not college, because they would've been able to defend me. But in college, you're pretty much all alone. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These would be the only things I would think about 24/7.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this professor, even while my case was pending.

After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**So if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and come up with any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make you look guilty, you'll look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!** NO, your life isn't over. Breathe. Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that I would be convicted of something I didn't do, and that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong.

Sorry for the long post but yeah, this is what happened. I could still sue my professor for defamation and mistreatment, but I don't think I will, because I don't care about him. It's really sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, sorry buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost. If you're convicted of something like this and you need someone to talk to or you need advice, I'd be more than happy to help you and share some of my wise wisdom haha.

Devin2019,1496156928,/r/college/comments/6e7wo8/i_havent_been_doing_so_well_in_college_i_feel/,"Hello everyone,

I just need to vent my feelings. I just feel so hopeless. I would really appreciate it if you take the time to read this. I'm going into my third year of college, and so far I haven't been doing very well. I am majoring in Biology with intentions of becoming a Physician Assistant. I have been doing poorly in pretty much all my science classes. So far I have received two C's in my Biology courses, two C's in my math courses, and a D in General Chemistry. So far, I will definitely have to retake two of my sciences since they are the prerequisites for PA school, and most schools require that you have a B or higher in the prerequisite courses. I just don't how I'm going to make it to PA school or even get through it if I am having such a hard time in my undergraduate science courses. I feel like my biggest problems are procrastination and time management. For example, if I know that I have an exam coming up in the next two or three weeks I tell myself ""Oh I have enough time"". Then I wait until about five days before the exam to start studying. I cram so much of the material in such a short amount of time that I hardly remember everything, and then I end up not doing so well on the exam. Then I tell myself, ""Oh I'll do better on the next exam"". Then I end up doing the same thing I did for the last exam. I keep falling into this trap of procrastination and not using my time wisely. I know I should be studying for my classes or an exam for a few hours each day from day one instead of waiting until the last minute, but it's just hard for me to get the motivation to study. Another bad habit I do is, I'll tell myself ""Okay I need to start studying for my upcoming Biology exam"". I'll go on my laptop to start going through the power point slides my professor went through for the day and relistening to the lecture that the professor posts online. I'll do that for like 30 minutes then I decide to surf the net for hours on end. I know I shouldn't be doing this, but it's hard to break this habit.

I get so jealous when my fellow classmates or friends do well on an exam and I do poorly. I also get upset when I score below average on an exam. I get jealous because they are are getting the results that I want and are on a better path towards grad school. I also get upset because I know that I'm capable of doing better. My assigned lab partner and I for my Microbiology lab this past Fall 2016 semester decided to exchange numbers to help each other out with lab stuff. I kind of struggled in lab, but he helped me out so much and was very patient with me which I am very grateful for. Biology labs at my university are intertwined with lecture. A few days after our third lecture exam, my lab partner and I were working in a group with a few other students for an experiment and he asks, ""What did you guys think of the third exam?"" We were all talking about it, and then he brings up the second exam which many people thought was very hard and since the raw average was low, the professor had to give a huge curve for that exam. He said, ""Everyone thought the second exam was hard, but I didn't think it was that hard. And with the huge curve the professor gave I did phenomenal"". After he said that I was curious to know how he did on the first and third exam. He said he got a B- on the third and I believe he said he also got a B on the first exam. He didn't say what his score was on the second exam, but if he said he did phenomenal I'm guessing he probably got like a 97 or 98. I just got irritated because he scored well above average on the exam that many people thought was hard and did pretty solid on the other exams and I was doing poorly. He was also doing well in lab. After the final grades were posted for the class, he texted me to ask me how did I do in the class? I got a C+ but lied and told him I got a B because I was discouraged to tell him I got a C because I assumed he got a good grade in the class, which he did. He told me ""I actually did wind up getting an A. I studied 6-8 hours a day for a week for the final so I scored quite well."" I told him good job, but deep down inside I was frustrated because I wanted an A in the class. I know I shouldn't be jealous of how he did because he worked so hard and I didn't and he helped me out so much in lab and was a nice guy, and is a pre-med student so he has to get good grades, but I can't overcome my jealousy. He ended up making the Dean's list for the first time in Fall 2016 and once again this past Winter 2017.

So far my overall GPA is a 3.0. My science GPA is a 2.5. I already know I'm going to lose my scholarship again. I say again because it was pulled from me after my first year for not meeting the GPA requirement of 3.3 after only having a 3.0. I appealed it and luckily the Financial Aid Office gave it back to me to give me a second chance. They made it very clear in their email that this was a one-time exception. Once again I didn't make the GPA requirement and now my scholarship is going to be taken away for good which it should. They gave me a second chance to raise my GPA, and I still haven't done that. They're not going to give me any more chances because the scholarship could've been given to someone who was going to take it more seriously. And they're going to think I'm full of it because I stated in my appeal letter a plan to improve my grades, and they're going to think I haven't followed through with that plan. Now I have to solely rely on financial aid and student loans to pay for my tuition. It's discouraging because I did so well in high school. I maintained a 3.9 GPA in high school and was number seven in my class of 120 students. Once I got to college, everything went downhill. College is definitely harder than high school. Especially being a science major. I asked myself ""Is the medical field the path I really want to go towards?"". I can't see myself doing anything else, I would love to save people's lives and help those in need. I know I shouldn't be jealous of anyone doing well in college because the only person I can blame is myself. It's not their fault that I'm doing poorly it's my fault. They're obviously putting in the effort and trying their hardest and I'm not. And I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but it's hard not to because they're doing things I want. I just feel so discouraged and am developing low self-confidence. I feel like I'm wasting time, money, and my life by not doing well in college. Sorry I made you read all this, but I just needed to pour my feelings out. This is how I feel and this is what I went through. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I would love to hear your advice.",college,I haven't been doing so well in college. I feel hopeless and defeated.

UpAHillToTheRight,1651645936,/r/college/comments/ui0cxy/roommate_issues_is_it_common_not_to_talk_to_your/,"A brief backstory: My first semester at my brand new university (I was a 1st-year Junior when I moved to my first dorm) I had a quad-style dorm with 3 other roommates. 2 fizzled out, and I was left with just 1 for a bit. 3 days before the semester starts, we randomly get a 3rd, and we all felt like we clicked right away. Things were good for about 2 weeks, and then the 3rd me and the one roommate were not getting along. I feel like I have an opinionated, yet reasonable personality, but she had a opinionated and non-reasonable personality, so we just were kind of clashing a lot. That 3rd week she got very aggressive with me (I do think drugs/alcohol were involved) and I decided it best for me to just switch rooms. After the room switch, I noticed she posted some nasty stuff about me on social media (just messy, fake stuff trying to incite more things) so I got an order of no contact against her and obviously blocked her promptly after I moved out. This order prevented both her and I from ever directly talking to eachother on socials, tagging, etc., as well as in real life. Also, we were not allowed to talk through 3rd parties like mutual friends.

After this, I got placed in a room with 2 other girls who were friends and roomed before. They knew each other well, partied together, were heavily involved with frats/sororities, etc. and I don't think either was super serious about school since they seemed to party 3 days a week, every week, skipped classes frequently, etc. This is not an issue for me though, nor was it ever, although I am (and was at the time) 21+ and they did ask me to buy alcohol for them, to which I refused, and they seemed a little annoyed. It never felt like there was problems between us, although they did act a little distant, sort of ignore me and not really include me with their plans, etc. I understand they aren't obligated to invite me, so I never really counted it against myself, however obviously it would've been cooler if they would have included me. Again, I didn't really care about this too much as I usually don't party/go out every week and only feel like doing it occasionally. This being said, I did offer to take them with me  shopping and made an effort to include them or try and help them out since I did understand that they didn't have cars with them or means of getting to the stores they may have wanted to. I just tried to be pleasant all around. (Please also note, I wasn't trying to be weird and asking ""can I come with u guys"" all the time. For the most part, I only asked once or twice and they said that things prohibited me from coming to the parties, which I felt was kind of a lie, so I never really asked again.)

Flash forward to one day, immediately after getting pretty drunk at a bar with friends, I come back late and leave my washcloth hanging off the shower caddy and clearly made a mess on the counter from getting ready for bed. I know this is gross and annoying, but being drunk is sort of my excuse in this case. I had an event to go to at 5 am the next morning, so by the time I woke up and got dressed, I'm out before I even remember to clean up the counter. I obviously got a text later that said that my roommates needed to talk to me. (Also, before anyone addresses it, I totally get it that we all pay expensive rates to live in a dorm, and I should not be subjecting them to my messes. I totally get that, however it was, over the course of all but 3 weeks in 2 semesters, only once and I made a very clear effort to never do it again. It was just a busy night, busy morning, and it was cleaned up in less than 24 hours.) Nonetheless, I swallowed my pride and prepared to allow my roommates to say whatever they wanted to me, and not say anything back really, even though I did, deep down a bit, feel like they had their own set of issues I would address at a totally different time. (They both ate my food pretty consistently, helped not only themselves but their guests to my drinks, some alcoholic ones included, to which I just promptly stopped buying eventually after I realized, and they did leave some of their own messes occasionally as well, to which I'll get into later). The talk never happened, which I was actually sort of bummed over because I did want to apologize for it, and all of our busy schedules sort of never allowed it to really be discussed again in the future. I never felt like held hard feelings or grudges, it was sort of forgotten and we all still remained relatively pleasant.  

Flash forward to next semester, the roommate who originally asked me to talk ends up moving out due to some unrelated problems. For about 3 weeks into this semester, I live with the other roommate who recently acquired a bf. She proceeds to leave trash around the apartment pretty much daily, never changed her trash can (that was actually mine that I let her use, obviously) which eventually acquired an odor from the feminine products in it, and she and her bf even left used condoms laying around some places too. I almost didn't want to say anything to her because I'm quite sure her bf was the one responsible, but I was really getting to my wits end with her and her boyfriend closer to that 3 week mark. She eventually tells me her best friend upstairs had a bedroom open that she was moving into, so I would inevitably live alone in my 3 bedroom dorm ( was totally cool with it btw). Also please note, the semester prior, with that other roommate, I did inquire about something she was doing which resulted in her snapping very aggressively at me, threatening me, trying to incite a physical altercation, etc., so that's why I was very apprehensive about bringing up an issue with this roommate. Like, I'd just been through a lot and wasn't really prepared to deal with the fallout yet again. 

Now, the issue comes in now with the aftermath. Obviously I blocked and deleted the aggressive roommate from all social media, but I did notice that slowly I lost contact with all other roommates. One deleted me from social media (not upset, just curious), another one I'm pretty sure blocked me months after she eventually moved out (also not upset, just sort of interesting), and the one who moved out last sort of never really talks to me and we just kind of avoid eachother now. 

I get with the circumstances that happened why some might have chosen to delete me, but I'm just confused as to why really? I don't feel like I did anything that warranted being blocked, but then again I don't really know what happened. She could have deleted all social media, I just don't know. I get roommates don't always stay in contact, but I really don't feel like I've deserved to have been avoided like this? I wouldn't say I'm hard to live with or anything, I try to be positive and bright, but for some reason roommates and I have never seemed to click... Is this common for any of you? Also, if there's any tips or reasonable critique, I'm happy to take it. :) I just am struggling with my mistakes and it's sort of making me feel bad even though I tried my best to fix all of them.

ME(30M) HER(21F)

Ok I'll start from lastnight.
I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.

Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they  went by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.

she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.

Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. Now let me tell you about my self

When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 
When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.
I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.

I'm not sure she even likes me like that, she could  just be being nice.
Also could I ever be normal(I'm mean not be depressed and focusing on the past so much) ? 

I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?

I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart enough to make it look like an accident.

So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?

Here's a little story

When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".

Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.
My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 

Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.
So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .

punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .


ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).
It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I still get dark jokes now.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.

I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.
The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.


Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me. 

Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a women.

ThePaulitician,1478333250,/r/college/comments/5b8z1z/i_need_help_and_advice_badly/,"I am currently a freshman at a school I do not want to be attending. This is mostly the fault of the family I was born into and the family I was brought up in and how both were extremely parts of my life that I was forced to live in.

I grew up in a large suburban town (population 250,000+) and my early years of schooling were great. I was a straight A student throughout all of elementary and middle school. I excelled in the advanced programs I had been put into and was very good at basketball and most sports as I was a natural at all of them.

High school was where it all ultimately changed for the worse despite my efforts to continue to be a contributing factor to society. When I was least expecting my academic career (the only career I had anymore) to go downhill, it did, and it wasn't even my fault. I continued to take advanced classes by enrolling in many AP courses in high school, most of which I did well in and passed the exams, saving myself about a year in time and money of college coursework. However, I could have certainly done better if it were not for my extremely detrimental domestic situation. To put a long story short, my father ""cheated"" on my mom for about 9 months before she found out. Once she found out, it was around the beginning of my sophomore year. Since that period, there were non-stop arguments, fights, and bickering between the 2 of them. This went on for about 2 years (so from early sophomore year to early senior year) and has since come to a halt for all intensive purposes. To be honest with you, I truly do not know whether or not my father cheated but at the end of the day, I say that his actions (infidel or not) had crippling detrimental effects on myself that I still live with.

Since this whole domestic instability, I have never been the same and I do not ever think I will be the same. I retracted involvement in sports partially due to not having my parents afford a car for me and because I no longer had the natural athletic build that I had in my childhood; instead, I was extremely skinny and I tried working out to an appropriate extent for my age but I never got back to where I should have been. My mother and father continued to be overprotective of me and refused to allow me to participate in contact sports, so I couldn't play football for example. As for my academics, it was so hard to stay focused but I did my best which was ok. I had no problem getting into any university that I applied to and received admission offers and scholarships from all but one. However, the scholarships I received were all partial and I was unable to afford the difference, so I was forced to stay in-state and I decided to go to a school about 3 hours away from home.

Life away from home has been very difficult for me. I don't know anybody here and I really don't even want to put myself out there because of my depressing and lonely personality. I don't have any family anywhere away from home because everyone on my mom's side died and we don't talk to anyone on my dad's side (they live in another country anyways). Life away from home is also more expensive than I expected it to be in both money and time costs. Therefore, I applied to another in-state institution that is commutable from my original home and I intend on going there for the remaining years of my study.

My domestic/home life has really crippled me and it's hard to talk about because I think a lot of people will think I am making it out to be worse than it is or because nobody else seems to have any of these issues. I was pretty much an oddball at my high school because I didn't do any sports for reasons previously explained, I was involved in extracurriculuar activities that were underfunded and unappreciated at my school, and I really didn't have many friends. I wasn't really into having too much fun either because... life wasn't very fun for me anymore.

It makes me feel so worthless that I was such a top notch student in almost all aspects and to think that my father (who had virtually no involvement in my education other than me giving him my report cards when the time came around) would think to do this. **It just sucks.** And I cannot put it any other way. **It makes me feel worthless.** To a point where I just stopped doing my best in some classes back in high school at times. *I could NOT cope anymore.* It was too much to say ""get over it"" and move on that fast because I had worked so hard from a little child being promised such great rewards and this is what I get... lovely. I no longer could take the curriculum in AP English because every book we read during the school year was about cheating, infidelity, or extramarital affairs. **I kid you NOT.** I couldn't do Calc BC anymore because I just counldn't find the environment or the motivation in myself anymore to study. And it felt so bad getting F's on every exam for something that wasn't all my fault. AP Chemistry and AP Physics weren't any better! I had tried so hard and this whole family corruption never went away in my mind despite all my attempts to set myself free.

I have been doing pretty good in college, mostly because I am not pursuing a STEM degree like I guess I originally intended to. I am studying Radio/TV with hopes of one day being a successful sports commentator or a political commentator.

I'm making the decision to go to school back home next year simply because I cannot afford to live away from home after this year and I think there are better opportunities in broadcasting back home where I come from. I will buy a car so that I can escape my house.

What made me write this is that I've missed class the past 2 days and it wasn't anything mandatory/important. However, these were the last classes before my exams in each class for next week. I was very depressed after having some betrayal and racist comments directed towards me by some friends. I stayed up very late on Wednesday night and missed class by about an hour on Thursday morning. However, Thursday night was a very depressing night for me as its my parents anniversary which is trash now obviously. They still celebrate it but it haunts me bad. I went to sleep at about 3 AM, woke up around 12:00 PM (20 minutes into my only class of the day) then went back to sleep **until 5 PM!!!!** I was so depressed and sleep to me is where everything goes away.

I wish I got out more, but to be honest, I hate alcohol, drugs, and partying because I just never have done it as I've never had a real group of people to call friends. Whenever I think about doing something outside my dorm, I just pull a typical chickening out and then continue to play video games for the next few hours because its free. I'd like to think that this is just a matter of not having enough to do that interests me. I truly wish I was working already and was doing something I was passionate about. Then, I'd think everything else would come naturally and maybe I could escape this dark, dark place I am in.

OptimisticEagle,1497774567,/r/financialaid/comments/6hynw7/how_can_i_raise_enough_money_in_3_months_to_study/,"tl;dr: I need some ideas to raise 8700 Euros (or equivalent) in 3 months.

Hello, everyone. I am a young student from Mexico who just got accepted into a year-long Engineering Master's program at a very good university of applied sciences in Germany (I was pleasantly surprised, since I went to an unremarkable public university in Mexico for my undergraduate studies, and the stuff I know is mostly self-taught). However, I don't have the required savings to pay for it. It is true that universities in Germany charge no tuition, but to get a student visa (and for very good reasons) I do have to give proof of financial means for the entire year (to pay for food and accomodation), which is set to 8700EUR / 9722USD / 174,841MXN, I believe. According to my calculations, I can live in Germany with as little 500 Euros a month, but the legal requirement is higher than that.

Before I proceed further, and to prevent any comments saying that ""I should just work"" or that ""I should have planned in advance"", I'll mention the following points:

- I've been saving money for the last 5 years.
- I worked while studying, lived at home with my parents (having to tolerate an unhealthy family life), skipped many lunches, etc., just to save money.
- While I was allowed to live with in my parents' house and my father gave me a hand every now and then, I was expected to pay for my own school expenses, so that was a big money sink, even though I went to a public university.
- I worked part-time for a relative as a web developer, but my take-home pay wouldn't exceed 3,500MXN / 174EUR / 195USD a month, because ""I was just a junior developer"", even though I did a better job than most people at the company. Other jobs available to students don't pay a lot better than this.
- Salaries aren't that good for recent graduates, either. If I decided to start working right now, it would take me several years to gather the required money. At 15,000MXN / 835USD / 747EUR monthly take-home pay (in a best-case scenario), this is no surprise. It seems as though employers want talented workers but aren't willing to pay up.
- Mexican currency has lost around 35% of its value from the time I started saving (2012), and exchange rates would annihilate any benefit I would get from saving in foreign currencies.

Okay, back on topic...

I used to have some savings that amounted to about 30% of the required money, and I thought I would be able to use them towards this; but I had some really big expenses lately, such as getting the Ministry of Education to process the paperwork for my Bachelor's degree, paying a certified translator to translate my university transcripts (to be able to send my applications for Master's programmes), etc., and after buying the plane ticket to Germany, my savings will drop to virtually zero.

So I'm looking for alternative ways to make money, and I have 3 months left to get it. Here's a list of the things I've tried, along with an explanation of why they didn't work:

- Working as an employee: as previously mentioned, I've been saving for the last 5 years, but it hasn't been enough, and the salaries in Mexico don't look very encouraging. I definitely won't be able to gather the money in 3 months as an employee, so this option is out of the question.
- Working as a freelancer: this is a tough one. Freelancer websites certainly host a variety of well-paid programming/translation/tutoring/whatever projects, but it's hard to get chosen among the many bidders. I've literally spent days just tidying up my public profile and bidding, but I have only been chosen once for a project that paid 15 US dollars. I spent them taking tests to certify my programming skills, thinking that since I got good scores (9xth percentiles), it would be a little easier to get chosen, and I've also posted gigs on Fiverr and similar sites, but no luck so far.
- Applying for a scholarship: in Mexico, there's a government entity (CONACyT) which gives very, very generous scholarships to study abroad. The thing is, the universities I applied to took a looong time to review the documents I sent. By the time I got the acceptance letter, scholarship applications were already closed. Besides, perhaps I shouldn't accept this scholarship, anyway, as I can't guarantee that I will return to Mexico and give something back, since my dream is to become a research scientist someday, and Germany is definitely a better place for this than Mexico is.
- Blogging: I started writing some blogs with quality content (sometimes not 100% original, but it would be unique among the content within reach of my target audience, and I always credited the sources). When my blogs had a sizable amount of content, I applied for AdSense, but my requests were denied.
- Opening a business: Okay, I didn't really go through the whole process, but after seeing huge amount of paperwork and the length of time it would take, it became clear that this was not a viable option. Besides, I would need to be here (and not in Germany) to take care of the business, which is exactly what I do *not* need. I have an entrepreneurial spirit, but apparently this is not the right time to unleash it.

These are the things I'm about to try:

- Developing a mobile app and deploying it to an app market: I'm very inspired by stories of relatively simple mobile apps that managed to get very popular (think Angry Birds, Flappy Bird, Candy Crush, etc.). This will take some time and won't guarantee anything, but I'm willing to take the risk.
- Working remotely: If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), I will be granted the German student visa if I can show that I can make at least 730-ish Euros a month. I am looking for an online programming job that pays, at a minimum, 750 Euros a month (or equivalent). I believe that in the U.S., for example (and perhaps in other countries, too) companies don't need to sponsor foreign workers for a visa as long as they live outside the country, so I'll try that.
- Applying for another scholarship: I've been looking for more available scholarships. I will hopefully find one eventually.
- Living with a German host family: there are some families or elderly people in Germany who want people to help them with house chores in exchange for food and accomodation. This would be a perfect option. If somebody in Germany signs a paper saying that they will cover my expenses, it can be used as proof of financial resources. I think this is what au pairs do. Am I right?
- Taking a loan: This would be a last resort, and I'd need to have a good idea of how I'm going to pay it back (interest and all).

As you can see, I am willing to do some pretty unorthodox stuff to make this happen. I won't give up until I have exhausted all available options, and even then, I'll keep trying next year.

I also have an admission letter to a very prestigious university in the UK, but the tuition is just ridiculous (more than 21,000 Sterling pounds), so I won't even bother trying, unless some sort of miracle happens that enables me to pay for it.

Do you guys have any more ideas? I'm willing to work hard. I'm open to many things, as long as they aren't illegal or hurt somebody's honor or dignity (mine or otherwise).

Uglybass,1461962166,/r/college/comments/4h1dxw/college_says_i_owe_a_debt_from_seven_years_ago_i/,"OK this is a long story, I will TL;DR at the end, but I am so lost, it's a crazy situation.

I went to community college on and off from 2005 to 2009. I got a few A's, a few C's and a lot of F's. While this is an issue, it's not the biggest issue. In my last semester attending the school (We'll say it's school A), I had gotten a financial aid check from them but I never cashed it. I found another way to pay for the semester and I sent the check back to Sallie Mae. I bombed the semester and had no inkling there was a debt on my account.
Fast forward to 2012, I joined the Navy in 2010 and I was wanting to start school again while I was in. I applied for a school and while I didn't want to get my School A transcripts, I knew I probably should anyway. Request a transcript, and the school tells me I have a financial hold on my account to the tune of $3000. They say that I never returned the student loan check to them and the balance was still outstanding. As I said, I sent the check back to the Loan Company, but apparently I was supposed to give it back to the school. So while I fucked this part up, there was a paper trail that the check was sent to Sallie Mae. I showed the school this info and they would tell me ""OK we will look into it, we are super busy right now."" I kept getting this same reply over and over for three years until my debt got sent to state collections. Since 2014, my state tax refund has been getting garnished to pay for this debt I don't owe.

I called my mom who lives in the state still to try and help me out, to go down to the school and talk to them in person. In 2015 she did a ton of work and we sent all this info to a lady in charge of financial aid. She told me she was close to getting to the bottom of this and she doesn't think I cashed the check.

I thought the situation was resolved, but low and behold, I got another tax return garnished by the state. 
Honestly, I can deal with the slow battle for this stupid fucking debt, but now my college career is on the line. I know you are supposed to report all your previous transcripts to any schools you attend, but I went to a community college in 2015 and I don't remember putting that I went to any other schools on my application. I did two semesters, got great grades, then went to another CC (we moved to a new area), didn't tell them I went to School A, am about to finish the semester with a 4.0. I am applying for University now and I need to send my transcripts to the University, so here's where I get fucked. These are the players:

School A (1st community college I ""owe money to"") 

School B (2nd community college) 

School C (3rd community college) 

School D (University)

Apparently, I put that I attended School A on my school B transcripts (I don't remember doing this, I am thinking they have a way of looking at a students entire school career online or something? School B wants transcripts from school A before they can send my transcripts to School C and D.
School C needs my transcripts from School B before they will send my transcripts to school D
School A won't send my official transcripts until the debt has been taken care of.

Now I am fucked, I was just going to lie and say I never attended school A, as a lot of the classes I took I had taken in school A and either failed or got a C (but have no gotten a B or A in after taking them again).
I am thinking of saying I made a mistake and that I never attended school A, and that I must have meant that is where I got my GED (technically I did, thats where you took the test). This will only work if they didn't find it out on their own.

I called School A and told them ""what the fuck, I need this shit resolved like pronto, what's the the hold up?"" They said now they have to see if the cash was checked, something that should have been done before but wasn't. They don't know how long this will take.

So here I am, back to square A, but now with ALL of my transcripts on hold due to fucking school A. I don't know how to make them figure this shit out faster, it's been four years and nothing has come of it, now I am losing money and if I don't figure this out before the start of the summer semester, I won't be able to enroll, pushing my finishing date back even further. This is all I can think to do right now:

Plan A) Call School B and tell them that I never took college courses at school A, I simply took my GED there and I must have not made that clear on the application. Hopefully they don't investigate further, but if they do, then I could possibly be tried for school misconduct for lying about not attending a school before

Plan B) Keep working to resolve this issue with School A over the phone and with my mom in person. I don't live in the same state anymore, so I can't go in person myself. Hope it is resolved in a week so I can continue my life.

Plan C) Get a fucking lawyer, start putting legal pressure on them to figure this out. Only problem is a lawyer costs money, is it worth losing money to get it resolved when I wouldn't get more than like 300 bucks back from my garnished tax returns?

Problems I see arising: If I get the issue with School A cleared and send my transcripts, it's going to fuck with my GPA, all those F's are going to drop me like crazy. This is why I didn't want to use them originally. I am a great student now, but this will bury me and possibly ruin my chances to get into a nursing program. I know its academic dishonesty to not send transcripts from all school, but should I keep up the lie and just try to get out of sending it to school B? I didn't put it on my app for school C or D, but if school B gets them, they will probably appear on my official transcript, right?
I have no idea what to do...

**TL;DR:** Went to a CC from 2004-2009 on and off, didn't do well. Took out a student loan my last semester, never cashed it, sent it back to loan company when I should have sent it to the school. School has me on the books for the $3000 check. Been battling for 4 years to get it resolved, still no resolution.
Went back to school in different state, thought I didn't mention School A at all. Apparently I did, they want my transcripts from them before they can issue my transcripts to two other school requiring them, stalling my entry into University. I can't move forward until School A debt issue is resolved
I can try to lie to school B about attending school A, saying I didn't take college courses there, but then I could get caught in the lie and really get screwed for student misconduct. I don't know what to do, please help me :-(.",college,"College says I owe a debt from seven years ago, I don't actually owe it, getting no resolution, affecting my future college career and finances, HELP!",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4h1dxw/college_says_i_owe_a_debt_from_seven_years_ago_i/,1461983766.0,can't pay for school,8.713333333333333
hartIey,1540415201,/r/financialaid/comments/9r3pyw/financial_aid_office_wont_give_clear_answers/,"This semester, I applied to community college and didn't get a reply back until late August, almost at the last minute. I got into the last financial aid workshop the college was putting on (Aug 23) and had someone from the financial aid office sitting next to me helping me fill things out the whole time. I had a court order ruling me emancipated, so she photocopied it and told me not to put parental information. When I finished, she assured me they'd been getting the information processed quickly and I'd likely have my aid the first week of school at the latest, no worries, have fun.

Sept 4, the first day of classes, I checked by the office to see how it was processing and was told I'd been dropped from my classes for nonpayment, but they put me back in, assuring me again that the money would be in within the week at the latest.

Sept 11, same thing. Dropped from classes, but the aid will be in before I'm dropped for nonpayment yet again in a week. I'm getting nervous now because Sept 17 is the deadline for class enrollment before aid stops covering it completely, but they just keep repeating that it'll be done before then, don't worry, they have it handled. They continue to say the same thing when I email on the 13th and 15th.

Sept 17, I check in in person to make sure I won't be dropped the next day. Financial aid advisor says she'll call the main campus and ask what's going on while I'm in class, so stop by after and she'll explain what's going on. I come by two hours later when my class lets out and the secretary lets me know the advisor is out of office hours now, but she left a note that just said to call the main campus and they'll explain. Secretary calls the main campus, their secretary says there's nobody in the office there either. Secretary goes into my file and looks up what they've been looking at because she knows I've been stressing over this for almost a month now. 

Apparently, a court order saying I'm emancipated doesn't mean I'm actually emancipated(???) and I need to provide parental information. Main campus knew this, but never put it on my file. I don't know if they didn't tell the advisor on my campus or if she never asked them about it, but now my record has a list of glaring red requests that need to be filed before I can get aid. The secretary gives me all of the paperwork and helps me fill out what she can, then tells me how to help my parent fill out what he needs. We go to the academic advisor, and she puts an override on my student account to keep me from being dropped for nonpayment again, since the error was the school's fault. As long as I keep passing in the paperwork as I get it and check in when I can, I'll be fine. Or so she says.

I bring in all of the paperwork on Sept 19, everything filled out as I was told to. They asked to be given my parent's requests for his Tax Returns and W-2s for 2016 so they could send them on my behalf and mark in the system that it's being worked on. I do so. Everything is put into the system and they tell me it's fine, just give it time now.

Sept 24, I come in just to ensure everything's been put in the system, since the situation has my anxiety racing and I have assignments that I need textbooks for due soon. They tell me there's 3 more papers to fill out and they need proof of birthdate and SSN for both myself and my parent, but I can just update my FAFSA with my parent's information so I don't have to hand those in. The financial aid advisor sits beside me and helps me do this. 

Sept 25, I confirm again with the financial aid office that I've submitted everything I need to, save for my parent's papers that they have proof of ordering. They say yes, everything is set and they're just waiting on the papers to come from the IRS.

Oct 2, I try to check in with the office again, but they're closed. Not even the secretary is there. I ask the people at the front desk when someone will be there for me to talk to, they tell me the 3rd from 10-3 and schedule me an appointment.

Oct 3, I call before I drive there because I don't trust what I'm told anymore. I get the answering machine. When I call the front desk, they say there won't be anyone in today but I can try the next day.

Oct 4, I call and they tell me nobody's in again. I stop trying to figure out her hours and decide to just show up and try to get them to tell me the truth. 

Oct 10, there's nobody in financial aid again but I'm able to meet with someone in Student Accounts, the woman who put the override on my account. She tells me none of the paperwork was marked as filed, so the system shows no proof of my attempts to get my aid. She calls the financial aid advisor directly on her personal line and we set up an appointment. She apologizes and sends me on my way.

Oct 16, my appointment comes and the advisor meets with me for an hour, 3/4 of which is spent with her sitting through software updates and chatting with her secretary while I wait for her system to start running. Once she can get into my file, she says everything's set, it just processed that morning and it'll likely be in my account Oct 22, since the office usually sends requests through on Mondays. She answers every question with ""it'll be in Monday!"" Then she sends me on my way.

Oct 20, I get a letter in the mail from the school with some of my paperwork returned and an explanation of what I've done wrong on it. It's all things the secretary told me to do. I get the information I need to correct it, then wait until the school is open again on the 22nd to go in and correct it.

Oct 22, I go in with the information but there's nobody in financial aid again. Her secretary won't give me the paper that I need to resubmit and denies the information I have. She insists aid will be granted by the end of the day.

Today, Oct 24, I get a letter in the mail saying if I don't hand over the 2.6k out of pocket ""when this invoice is received,"" I'll be dropped from my classes and not allowed to return to school, then they'll send a debt collector after the money they're owed.

This might not be the right sub for this, but what am I supposed to do? It's impossible for me to go to the main campus as I don't have transportation during their office hours. I can't pay out of pocket, an immediate family member is in the hospital and we're using everything we have to pay those bills. Everyone at the college I spoke to assured me that since it was their error, they would take responsibility for it and I'd be fine as long as my account was paid off by the end of the semester. I don't even know what they meant when they said my emancipation didn't count and they refused to explain it to me. Is there anything I should be doing that I'm not?

bubblegumpandabear,1543344081,/r/college/comments/a0xobt/i_have_a_d_in_a_class_after_missing_a_quiz_due_to/,"So this semester has been absolutely terrible. It began with my new apartment's oven catching fire and me missing classes from catching a cold before and after this fire. I've been having ongoing issues with waking up in the mornings, constant exhaustion getting sick all the time, blurred vision, memory loss, dizziness, nausea, etc. Long story short, in the month of October I had four MRIs, a spinal tap, five visits to the hospital for testing, and six neurology appointments. I found out a few weeks ago that I have MS and have started medication. As I said, this semester has been awful.

I've kept all of my professors in the loop with doctor's notes as proof so they were aware and when I finally received a diagnosis, I went to Student Accessibility services as my neurologist suggested so my professors would receive an official letter, so they know I haven't been stringing them along with nonsense or something. All of my professors have been understanding except one, a foreign language professor. 

I missed three quizzes in this class. One was because of a doctor's appointment, so I brought the professor the note and she let me retake it. Another was because I had a short time window to figure out the insurance stuff to pay for my medicine or we would end up paying an ungodly amount (think thousands) out of pocket, so I missed a quiz to meet with them in person and deal with that. I told her what happened and that I did not expect to retake that quiz, as her syllabus states you can retake up to two quizzes with an excused absence like a doctor's appointment. 

The third quiz I missed was due to being ill. I can't visit a doctor every time I'm sick, and I don't even have a car, so I just emailed her at 9 AM that I may not make it to class, which is at 1:30 PM. When I attempted to make my way to the bus, I was so dizzy and nauseous I could not even walk in a straight line. This is after my diagnosis and after I began my medicine, both of which have dizziness and nausea as side effects. She did not respond to the email but sent a notice to the entire class stating that nobody did well on a specific portion of the quiz and that she would let them retake it....except those who missed the quiz. Quizzes are 40% of my grade, so that is a problem.

I have also missed homework. I was upfront with her on two or three days when I had so much happening that I simply did not go to class in favor of studying for exams since all of my appointments were happening during midterms. There are also days when I had doctor's appointments or was sick like I was with the quiz, and not able to make it to class, and had to accept a zero on the homework. Homework is 10% of my grade. This class had one project. We had to write a speech, worth 5% of our grade, and then present it to the class, another 5% of our grade. The day I had to do the presentation portion, I went to talk to her and apologize for being a mess during the semester, but she said things that really upset me. I was crying, so she told me to submit the speech ""later"". When I got home, my laptop stopped charging and I spent all of my time attempting to make it work. That night, at 1 AM, I emailed her about it, and she replied at 9 AM that the speech was due the day it was due but to just record myself with my phone. I emailed her back that the speech was on my laptop and she never responded, but the speech portion of my grade was changed to a zero. I submitted the speech regardless yesterday when my laptop was all good, and she has not responded. 

Now, when I mentioned she said some upsetting things...here is what she said. Ever since I first started talking to her about this, she has been suggesting that I drop the class, withdraw from everything, or take an incomplete in the class. She has made several comments that to me, feel condescending. When I went to submit the first draft of that speech, she looked at it and said it was filled with mistakes and then went on about how long it must have taken me to write it. When I had just explained to her that with the constant appointments I didn't have much time to focus on writing it, but that I did my best. I guess to be fair, it was really shitty. I can write all day in the language this class is teaching, but not when I'm ill and exhausted. She has also been fond of pointing out that I don't know a lot of things I should know for this course. The thing is that I do know them, I'm just experiencing memory issues and am learning how to recall things I've forgotten. She also keeps telling me that the foreign language isn't my major, so I don't have to be taking the class. I don't need to focus on it, I can come back to it later, and I should focus on my major. Bullshit. I love this language, I've been learning it since high school and plan to visit the country one day. I'm minoring in this language and she knows this, so I actually do need this class anyway.

She also said that she didn't understand how I made an A in the previous level class, and that that professor must have been an easy grader. I actually talked to him, and he said that I got the grade he felt I deserved. She also keeps mentioning that she doesn't understand how I skipped the first level course since I don't remember things you learn in that class. Well, once again, I took those classes when I didn't have two brain lesions and a million doctor's appointments. She has told me to my face that if I don't do well on the next quiz, exam, and last few homework assignments, I am going to fail her class. And this is when I asked her what I could do to do better. 

The Student Accessibility services couldn't help me- she says that everything has been graded and she can't change the grades. They said she's set in stone on this so they can't do anything. I asked my advisor to send her an email and he said that he can't do much either, after talking to her. He said that she feels really strongly that you have to be in class to learn, which is kind of bullshit. She doesn't teach anything that isn't in the book or that doesn't appear on powerpoint slides all students can access so I could and can absolutely catch up on days that have been missed. Yes, going to class in person is very important. You learn much more by being forced to sit down and listen for a certain amount of time. But that response, in my opinion, is basically telling me that if I get sick too much I will not get any help and will fail the class. 


What the hell am I supposed to do at this point? I was going to take an incomplete, but many people have told me not to since it will only delay anything happening. Keep in mind, she is the professor for the next level course, so I will have to interact with her in the future.

ThinVast,1607468035,/r/college/comments/k9f4ke/american_universities_should_move_away_from_a/,"Highschool is the partly the reason why I think we have so many U.S colleges that enforce a liberal arts education curriculum and make you take all these gen eds that are not part of your major. Defenders of liberal arts colleges like to say that you need to go to college "" so you can become more well rounded, better critical thinker"" as if highschool could not teach you that. I mean what is the purpose of highschool if I have to go to college to be able ""to become a better thinker"" and whatnot. I mean, I've heard various versions from Americans about the point of going to college but not the point of highschool or the K-12 system and how it plays a role in students transitioning into college or into adult life.

Other universities around the world don't enforce a liberal arts education that emphasizes well rounded learning. If you major in history, you just study history. If you major in math, you just study math. You can graduate in as soon as 3 years because you don't have to take these other courses that dont' pertain to your major. Those majors I listed don't aim to prepare you for jobs like engineering so it's not a vocation. Only in America, will people say that college is supposed to make you take these well rounded courses and that if you just want to study the topic of your major, then it's considered a vocation or trade school mean for job training even if you just want to study music theory all day. Some Americans need to realize that when they define college, it is not a fundamental concept of higher education, but an American concept. Even the word ""college"" in the U.K means a different thing from college in America. Defenders of gen eds in college also like to say that engineers need a liberal arts education so they can become better writers and understand about ethics better, but it doesn't require 6 humanities/social science courses or an extra year of studying all these different courses simply to be a better communicator, orator, or have a better understand of ethics. I'm not denying the importance of these skills, but if you look at canadian colleges like the University of Toronto, a math specialist degree only require students to take a a few ethics courses. I don't think graduates of universities outside the U.S are somehow less educated because they didn't have a well rounded education in higher education. As I mentioned before, what is the purpose of highschool if college has to educate me again to become a better communicator. Additionally, my college education costs 52k USD in tuition per year so why should I not be able to choose the courses I want? It's not like my education is being subsidized by the government. Of course, the motivating reason for me to be at my university is for the connections after I graduate and a specific academic program within the university I like because realistically, no one is going to pay 52k USD per year if they want to ""have a well rounded education."" If you think a liberal arts college education is so important, you would still pay 52k USD and be in debt for a long time, right?

Defenders of the liberal arts in colleges would say that if education was free and subsidized, it shouldn't matter if you had to to take courses that you were not interested in. However, as I mentioned before, why not have all the well rounded learning in highschool. Did I  learn jackshit before going to college. I am taking many gen eds in college that I have taken before in highschool so I am basically re learning the same subjects. You might say that I should take AP classes and then I wouldn't have gen eds and this whole discussion would be pointless. But , realize that AP classes exist because the rigor across all American highschools are not uniform. Anecdotally, I have even heard a highschool student outside of the the U.S say that an AP class in the U.S is equivalent to a non honors class in their highschool so that says a lot about the rigor of the U.S education system. If education was not controlled on a State or local level and was controlled by the federal government, perhaps we wouldn't need these gen eds to re teach highschool students. I am sure most of you wont deny that there is an issue with the U.S K-12 system considering how much more is funded for public schools despite English and Math proficiency levels of U.S students not being as high as other countries. When people discuss about the problem with universities in American I dont' think the K-12 system cannot be ignored like it is its own separate issue.

When I hear people say the liberal arts encompasses math and science, I also find that very disingenuous. The liberal arts curriculum in the college that supposedly encompasses math and science is probably one math and two science course a student takes and I don't think students gain much value from one math class in college. The liberal arts curriculum is most likely made up of social science/humanities courses, so the liberal arts barely encompasses subjects outside the humanities and social sciences. Someone majoring in humanities in a liberal arts college is more likely to take liberal arts classes that overlap with their degree requirement than a STEM major in a liberal arts college who has to take many liberal arts classes that are not related to their degree. Also realize that the liberal arts has meant slightly different things in the past. The liberal arts during the Renaissance period was rooted in classical languages and literature and had a strong emphasis on the humanities.

I would like to say a lot more but I have condensed it into fewer words. My entire point of writing this is that I vehemently dislike these gen eds I have to take and that I dread every single moment of taking. I went to college so that I can study math and only math. These gen eds divide my attention and make me distracted from my goal of studyng math. I have learned a lot more and far more during the summer studying math on the my own because I had no distractions, but because I have these gen eds to take, I feel bottlenecked like my potential is wasted. If I put my heart to math, I would probably fail my other classes because I'd get so obsessed. I could study math all day, and you might think it makes me a very narrow minded boring person ""who doesn't deserve to be in college"" like many others have told me and I think I have heard every type of response, but I don't care what you think. I have had countless discussions with many people on why a liberal arts education in higher education is important but nothing has changed my mind that I dislike my liberal arts education and do not find as much value in it and I don't think anything will ever change my mind no matter what anyone says. If anyone tries to change my mind, it will only increase my hatred of the rhetoric by americans about the importance of the liberal arts. I have even considered dropping out of college just to prove a point about how serious I am. Hearing Americans discuss about the importance of a liberal arts college makes me angry since it feels like it's being shoved down my throat. I guess it all comes down to, why can't I choose what I'd like to study?",college,American universities should move away from a forced liberal arts education.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/k9f4ke/american_universities_should_move_away_from_a/,1607489635.0,can't pay for school,8.673333333333334
[deleted],1354146867,/r/AskReddit/comments/13yopf/reddit_what_are_some_things_you_experienced_as_a/,"I've got two stories.

First one takes place when i was in grade school, i'd say around grade 4 or 5. Around this time, ""crazy bones"" were all the rage. It was basically a more expensive version of pogs. The cool thing to do was trade with people and collect the ""rare"" ones to complete your collection. There was this website where you could meet other kids and mail each-other crazy bones. 

So i finally found one older kid who had one i wanted, and we set up a trade. I got an envelope and put my crazy bone in it, and because i was a friendly kid i got a little piece of paper and wrote ""enjoy :)"" or something to that effect on it and put it in next to the crazy bone. I mailed it to this other kid and he received it before he sent me his (which was a dick move, since in theory he could have just kept his and not bothered to mail it). The day his package arrived, i opened it up and found a 2 page manifesto from the kid along with the crazy bone. It was basically 2 typed out pages about how i was irresponsible with my packaging (i didn't use bubble wrap or anything, it never really crossed my mind since i was only a young lad). I just remember getting this sinking feeling in my gut when i showed the lengthy diatribe to my mom and she basically just told me ""he's right, you should have used bubble wrap"". 

Even now i don't know what i learned from that ordeal, it still feels like something out of a Calvin &amp; Hobbes comic to me. I think i became an ever so slightly less cheerful person that day.

---

My second experience happened in junior high. I went to this ""Rotarian Leadership Camp"" for youths. It was like 4 days at this re-purposed bible camp in the middle of nowhere in northern Saskatchewan. I didn't know any of the people i went with from my hometown, they were all a year or 2 older than myself. I get to this camp and i'm assigned to this one bunkhouse with 2 supervisors and about 8 other kids. The bunk houses had 16 beds total, separated into 2 separate ""rooms"" connected by a wide doorway and wouldn't you fucking know it, all the bunks are taken in one side so i'm left bunking alone in the other side of the house. All the kids on the other side seem like they're friends from some other school. 

Fast forward to the first day of activities. Swimming is on the schedule and it's a miserable, cold day. This camp took place towards the end of summer so the water was barely swimmable on a good day, never mind on a cloudy windy day like this. Every damn kid in this camp seems to be enjoying themselves and all i can remember was standing in the water, waist deep, freezing my ass off wishing that we'd just be done with this damned activity. The supervisors at this camp didn't seem to give much of a shit if we didn't fully participate so i went and changed into some warm clothes and just sat around and read a book while everyone continued swimming. 

Later that day every kid in the camp was given a cardboard box. We had to write a nice message to every kid in the camp, this was basically a way for the supervisors to force us to mingle with people we didn't usually hang out with. Over the course of the camp i didn't really mingle a lot of people, i was a pretty shy kid and some of these people were pretty intimidating. This was a leadership camp so as a result most of the kids here were extroverts. I made a friend or two from some other bunkhouse but they were the ""strange"" kids that none of the cool kids hung out with so i distanced myself. The social hierarchy of high school was prominent in this camp, kids were already segregating into the cliques you commonly find at high school. I was somewhere in between, knowing which groups to avoid was something I picked up in my early junior high years. I felt awful and lonely but that's how things go when you're that age.

The next day we did this career brainstorm thing where we were rounded up into groups and did little presentations for the group about what kind of job we might want in the future. I was in junior high with absolutely zero insight into what job i might want. So i chose to do a presentation on becoming an astronaut. I didn't care about the topic i picked, i just wanted to be done with the presentation. People didn't pick up on the joking nature of the presentation so i was known by most kids from there on out as the ""astronaut guy"".

On the second-last night of the camp there was a dance. Me being the shy kid, i didn't really partake. The entire camp felt like a trip to the dental office at this point, i just wanted to get it over with and be done with it. Nothing good ever comes out of putting a bunch of young teens in a barn together and setting up a dance, i remember a bunch of mopey girls going off and crying and a bunch of cool kids making out with the hot girls, etc. Later after the dance the guys from my cabin were hanging out and talking so i figured i'd try to at least join their conversation. We'd lived in the same cabin for 3 days and i barely had talked to any of them. I piped up about how they had played too much vengaboys or whatever the popular girl band was at the time, in an attempt to join the conversation. Pretty instantly i got shot down by some loud mouth little asshole. I didn't bother with them again after that. I don't think i even wrote any of them a letter for their cardboard box. 

I was so goddamn happy to be gone from that camp. We had to give a speech to the local Rotary Club and being the studious kid i was, i gave a 2 minute speech to a room full of old men. The other kids from my hometown didn't even write a speech or bother practicing anything, they just got up to the podium and basically mumbled and made a fool of themselves. ""These old guys paid for your ungrateful ass to go to this camp and you can't even be arsed to write a speech"", i remember thinking. The irony of it all was that these assholes enjoyed the camp more than me and I was the one going on about how it was the best fucking time i ever had. Later that day i sat down in my room and dumped out my cardboard box full of comments from other people, most of the comments i got were ""good luck becoming an astronaut"". I chucked the entire thing into the garbage.

I look back on that whole thing now and laugh, but at the time it was just a bunch of unneeded bullshit in an already socially anxious, stressed out kid's life. I tried my best not to exaggerate any of the story. I think that for better or for worse that 4 day hell camp showed me exactly the kind of person i don't want to become.

GennaroIsGod,1596223673,/r/college/comments/i1duf9/for_those_angry_about_tuition_and_hybrid_andor/,"Disclaimer: As much as I don't like to defend Universities (because I think a lot of what they do is wrong), I feel as though people don't realize what's happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people angry about schools deciding to go fully online or do hybrid classes and students being angry about ""being charged more for less"" or whatever the situation maybe for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though a lot of students / parents / people don't realize what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lack of Communication: 

1. State Universities are housed in the control of what's called ""[The Board of Regents](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Board+of+Regents)"" each state has their own board, and typically the president and administration takes orders from them and applies those orders to their own university - so oftentimes what you may see as ""the president screws us"" is ""the president was told by the board of regents to do this, so they did it and now they look like d\*ck heads"". In this case, a lot of what's happening is the board of regents is working with local (and probably federal) governments to attempt to create solutions for students at the colleges, and then they say ""Hey \*State Name Here\* University - We've decided you can't have students be on campus (two weeks before school starts) go deal with that."" And then your school's administration has to go deal with that. And then you as a student / parent / customer gets an email ""Sorry everyone no in-person classes, maybe next time"" and now you hate your university for their lack of communication and everything else.   

2. I'm **not** saying this is the case for all the scenarios playing out right now, but ultimately your state's board of regents has the final say on everything whether your school administration likes it or not.   

3. Even if its the board of regents that's having problems coming up with quick and concise solutions that may not be 100% on them either - government officials have a lot of stuff to on their plates right now, and schools are just 1 piece of the puzzle - it's like working on a project for someone and you can't do your part without them getting their part done, and then they give you their part 20 minutes before the projects due. You're angry at your partner and your client is like ""wtf why didn't **YOU** get **YOUR** part done???"" It's not completely fair. But that's likely the way a lot of this is right now.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tuition Costs: 

1. A lot of students are having to deal with hybrid and / or fully online classes for some and / or all their courses and see that their tuition prices are staying the same and in some cases they're even going up (from what some people have said).   

2. I'm not sure if any of you have ever worked in the campus IT department or dealt with them before but it can oftentimes be slow and likely unsatisfactory. From my personal experience of working at mine for 2 years as a student and working closely with other IT departments from surrounding schools - I can tell you that most schools IT departments (from some reason) are extremely under-budgeted. Running internet for a University can cost upwards of 10 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, just to get you the student to access [google.com](https://google.com) while on campus, or for you to be able to VPN into the network to work on schoolwork or use school-related software. These budgets are spent less on employees and more on getting the stuff to work correctly - in turn giving the small teams a giant mess to deal with when something breaks, or a teacher not knowing how to open their email, etc...   

3. So what does this have to do with your tuition? Well, teachers now have to retrofit their classes to hybrid modes or fully online classes that may include expensive video gear, hosting large amounts of data on servers, training, new expensive software that often charge per student per year,  and much more.   

4. This means that the department that was already under-budgeted and underemployed now has 10x more work to get done, and in more of a deficit and is gonna have to deal with an entirely new set of problems this brings. Its all simply going to cost more to implement. Its basically as straight forward as that.   

5. I know a lot of students are going to say ""Yeah but this online stuff isn't even good, my teacher sucks and the entire way my university is doing this sucks"" - While this may be a possibility you have to remember that for the majority of the people at the University this has NEVER been done this way before and they were likely given just as much warning as you were when you received your emails about changes.  

6. Not only all of this but teachers and faculty are being laid off or getting pay decreases due to schools enrollment being down so much and one might think ""Well if they're firing people why shouldn't my tuition go down?"" Well with all the new changes they're probably losing far more money than they did last semester and they if you want your tuition lowered then they're probably going to have to fire more underpaid professors and then it'll take you half a semester to get an assignment graded and an email response them the ones that are left.  

7. Side story: Last year when my university ""announced"" that they were going fully remote until the end of the semester we at the IT department weren't even told first by the university - WE SAW A NEWS ARTICLE COME OUT SAYING WE WERE GOING TO GO ONLINE. The following day we got an email stating it and nothing was prepared at all. (Just thought this could shed some light for some people). 

 

&amp;#x200B;

This is clearly no ideal for anyone right now, it sucks and it seems like you're getting the sh\*t end of the stick - but the University and the people that work there are probably getting fried from the burnout of being overworked and underpaid, and they likely don't like it just as much as you do. Their careers and livelihoods are on the line whether it be from their contracts not getting renewed, being laid off, their entire department being downsized, etc... All because enrollments are down and massive things are being changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anything THEY probably want to see everything succeed the most - because if their university succeeds they'll have a stable job and can continue to live and support families in a lot of cases. Its in their best interest to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying everything universities do is right by any means. But I imagine everyone is working around the clock to get answers and keep students happy - because universities **CAN** and **WILL** go under. Quite some years back my university was in a position where it almost did that and their plan was to just turn it into a hybrid campus for one of the other state universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, this helped open your minds a little bit more if they weren't already. At the end of the day if you absolutely cannot deal with what's happening right now, a lot of people are taking off semesters and universities are honoring their scholarships when they return (reach out to your financial aid department and see what they can do).

When we were just kids, we were told that we lived in the land of opportunity, and that we could be anything we desired.  In grade school we were told that if we made good grades, attended college, and worked very hard, that we would find the success we all dreamed of.  Now as adults we are living a harsh reality.  Nothing we were told was true.  Our parents had less and achieved more.  I often think about the successes of my father and others I know of his generation.  I supposedly have all of the same opportunities for success that they had, but I cannot help but feel like it is less of a reality for me and my generation.  Despite the technological advancements of the last 30 years that would seem to give us an edge, I feel like it is harder than ever to achieve the successes I dream of every day.  Are times that different?  Am I just naive?  Is it still as easy to achieve success as it was 30 years ago?  If not, what has changed?   

Here is the backstory that explains the way I'm feeling:

My father was born in 1959 to a working class family.  A Gen X baby.  He graduated high school in the late 70's and did not attend a single day of college.  He acquired a vast knowledge of telecommunications networks by in the 1980's, and started his own telecommunications equipment brokerage in the early 90's.  He worked from home, with no employees, and managed to make over $500k a year after taxes.  Even so, we lived very modestly.  In 1997, he started a CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) providing local/long distance telephone service, as well as high speed internet service, to basically all of the Southeast United States.  He was one of the five original founders and acted as Executive Vice President.  On paper he was worth about $65 million dollars, but that was, of course, in stock value that he never got to cash in on.  His salary was actually much less than he made when working by himself from home.  He was not your typical executive. The company eventually fell victim to the telecom bust in 2000, but, with more capital from the original investors, it managed to stay afloat when similar companies went bankrupt.  The same investments that saved the company had the effect of essentially diluting his shares down to nothing.  That CLEC went through a series of mergers, and is now part of one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States.  He left in 2004 to form a small, local business, which never really turned a profit.  My father succumbed to depression and took his own life in the summer of 2008.  Even though he never benefited financially from his telephone company, I feel like it was a great success.  He created thousands of well paying jobs, and competed, successfully, with giants like Bell South.  His company donated large sums every year to charities that made lives better.  The network he built is now part of the backbone of telecommunications in the United States, and we are likely sending communications over it right at this very moment.  

Now a bit about myself:  I am a 24 year old male.  I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA, and thus was able to attend college on multiple scholarships.  My parents did not pay for a single penny of my college career.  I graduated Magna cum Laude in the spring of 2011.  For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be an Airline Pilot.  I started flight school in June of 2011 and finished in November 2011.  I passed all but one of my FAA check rides on the first attempt (the initial instructor check ride has a notoriously low first time pass rate).  I am a commercial rated pilot and multi-engine flight instructor.  While I knew that none of that would guarantee me a job, I felt like with some hard work I would get where I wanted to go.  I returned home from flight school last November, but I have been unsuccessful in finding a flying job.  I can't even get a job as a lowly flight instructor.  I guess people aren't doing a lot of flight training in this economy, and without the hours I would build as a flight instructor, I will never reach the 1500 hours required by the FAA (according to a new law taking effect next year) to become an airline pilot.  I had to do something to make some money until my flying career takes off (pun most humorously intended), so I started a small business utilizing the knowledge I have for another passion of mine: audio/video installations. I sunk almost every penny I had into starting this business with a friends from college.  We specialize in residential and commercial installations of audio and video components, but we also do phone systems, networking, security and surveillance, home automation, acoustic treatments…. pretty much everything electronic.  We spent a considerable amount getting established, yet we have nothing to show for it.  The jobs that we've had have been few and far between, and mostly by word of mouth to close friends and family.  We don't have the money for any substantial advertising, and we have pretty much maximized the free marketing available to us.  We have even invested money into some online local advertising, like Facebook.  People seem to prefer to pay the Best Buy ""Geek Squad"" much more money to do much less work.

So here I sit, a college graduate, FAA certificated commercial pilot and flight instructor, and small business owner… barely making ends meet.  I moved back in with my mother, and I've started selling off any possessions that are worth anything to invest that money into my company, which is pretty much a failure.  I have no idea how to turn it around.  All I want to do is fly, and I cannot even afford to do that.  Since I haven't been flying, I am no longer ""current"" and would likely have to invest a few thousand dollars in training to become proficient again.  Worst of all, I feel like my father would be very disappointed in me if he were still alive.  He came from much less fortunate conditions than myself, was given no help, and he achieved so much success at a relatively young age.  He created jobs and helped others.  I cannot even help myself.

I'm trying to look at the bright side of things, but it is pretty hard to find the silver lining when my dreams are falling apart around me.  I feels like I take one step forward and two steps back.  Are things going to get better, or is this the kind of life that I should expect to live?  Am I alone in feeling this way, Reddit?

TL;DR:  My father and his friends came from lowly beginnings and achieved great success with little to no help.  Despite my personal achievements, hard work and outside help, I cannot even make ends meet.  Are times just different these days, or am I just being a little bitch?

Pippen1984,1428336618,/r/college/comments/31n295/10_questions_you_should_ask_every_recruiter_you/,"As a bit of background, I used to work in the university system as a teaching assistant, recruiter and administrator. I frequently had face-to-face interaction with prospective students. Invariably, I'd get questions about the required G.P.A., what test scores they were looking for, etc. Fair enough. I do think, though, prospective students need more information, and they're not getting it. Here are 10 questions I think you should be asking: 


*1: ""When was the curriculum last overhauled/updated?"" 


This should be priority #1. Most people think that universities are on the vanguard of their field. Truth is, except for a few programs, they are usually really out-of-date. Even top-tier schools. Since most of the non-professional schools have no need to keep-up with market trends, or employment statistics, they rely on a curriculum designed decades ago. Some were re-designed in the 1970s and 80s, some in the 1990s and some a recent as this year. Just because they have a course on andriod app development, or social media marketing doesn't mean the program is all that up to date. Find out. If they don't know, get them to find-out. 


*2: ""Who primarily teaches required courses?"" 


Increasingly, required courses (or ""core modules"") are being taught by graduate students and adjunct faculty. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, schools who are overly reliant on them as a source of instruction are often doing so because their full-time, tenured faculty are teaching at a reduced frequency. This can mean that valuable classes in a teacher's area of expertise are being taught by someone else. This can reduce the quality of your over-all education. 


*3: ""What kind of additional services do you offer your students? I'm thinking of counseling (academic), career planning, engagement/involvement.""


Many schools post banners for student politics, but are they engaged? Governments (State, Federal, Provincial, etc) often have throngs of summer internships, as do major corporations, NGOs, health care organizations, etc. Most people don't know how to access these resources. Your school should be actively involved in this. Most aren't heavily involved and students can go for 3 or even 4 years before finding-out about these options and how you can benefit!


*4: ""What are your meals plans like and what do they cost?"" 


Who cares about meal plans?! Well, many (if not most) university cafeterias are out-sourced to companies like Sodexo and Aramark. They can charge anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 a semester for a meal plan. Now, what they term ""meal"" is a combination of food items priced at restaurant levels. The issue is that they usually don't offer comprehensive, well-balanced meals and focus rather on quick-prep items like burgers, fries and pre-made salads. Its often hard to find food that isn't extremely unhealthy, and since the cafeterias usually have reduced operating hours during holidays and weekends, people usually end-up eating garbage. The ""Freshman 15"" is often a direct consequence of a very rapid, and very poor, dietary change. If your school is offering an expensive meal plan, I recommend ensuring that you have alternative options. What's near the campus that you can use to augment your diet?


*5: ""Can I design my own major?"" 

Many, if not most colleges and universities, have that option. Often called ""Self-designed major"" or ""Special Individualized Program,"" students (usually outside of STEM) can elect to design a major of their own. It requires you maintain a specific GPA and meet very regularly with academic counselors, but can be an excellent option for those motivated enough. If you have a specific interest or goal, this may be the way for you to go. 


*6: ""What kind of campus medical services do you offer? Are they 24 hours?"" 


A big problem, not just for women, or for freshman, or people in very intense programs, or at-risk LGBT-Q students is mental health. Often, universities offer very rudimentary services. If you're very anxious, depressed or not feeling well, you need to see someone. What services do they offer? Is it referral-based? Do campus health insurance schemes cover their costs? Schools that offer an M.A. candidate from their clinical psych program often use this to cut costs and frequently don't run the gamut of (what I would call) necessary services.  Additionally, most students begin to regularly engage in sex, including oral, vaginal and anal. While it's tempting to push fate, a lot of people need more than just luck. Condoms, the pill, lubricant and some advice. Make sure the sexual health department isn't a bunch of students manning an office trying to tell you about sex (which, they've usually never engaged in.). Either an RN or an MD! Make sure they have decent services. 


*7: ""How are accommodations decided upon?""

People often ask what the accommodations are like, but not usually how they have a roommate decided for them. One of the single most stressful problems is a bad roommate. Often, people don't mesh, or they haven't lived on their own long enough to know how to be a functional individual. What you should do is find-out if you can move mid-semester and how they decide upon roommates. If it's a random draw, be leery. That's usually code for an accommodations team that isn't very active/engaged. 


*8: ""Who patrols the campus and how do you report campus-related crime?"" 

Even with the Clinton-signed amendment in the US and crime reporting in Canada, campus crime reporting varies widely and is not necessarily a great barometer of the campus environment. Often, the campus security is loathe to deal with petty crime, or aggressive students. A recruiter is giving you a song-and-dance about their ""community"", but read their crime statistics. If they seem incredibly low, be dubious. Many of these universities (often with 15,000 to 20,000 students plus faculty and staff) and have a crime rate that's 1/100th of a city of its size? Always get those statistics. If they seem too good to be true: they are.


*9: ""What kind of learning support do you offer?"" 


This is important for more people than we may think. As an example, I had a student who had a common learning disability. Her mother was getting stone-walled wherever she called and so I ended-up getting her. She didn't know what services existed, because no one had told them. Even if you don't have a learning disability, why not know? Many times people have to take classes like calculus or advanced chemistry and it may require getting some help. Yes, there can be student tutors, or there may be more comprehensive help. It's better to know how to access the resources *before* you need the help. I would also recommend if there are professional services, that they should be your first stop. 


*10: ""I want to be a (fill in goals here) and want to study (program). Is this a good idea?"" 

Ask. Ask. Ask. Many career counselors at the school can guide you. So, you want to be a doctor. Pre-med, right? WRONG. Lawyer. Pre-Law? WRONG. Much of what people think are great tracks to their goals are a mistake. Do you think that universities haven't seen ten thousand other political science graduates with a minor in Latin applying to law school? Don't do something because it may get you where you want to go. Figure-out where you want to go and how you can make it there. A great option for medicine may be Anthropology with a minor in health sciences (for instance). Maybe Russian &amp; Economics for law. There are lots of options. You have to figure-out what interests you and how you can best do it. Don't do something you may dislike because you think it's the best option. Because, it's usually the worst.

[deleted],1306963829,/r/AskReddit/comments/hpe7w/swimming_in_debt_from_school_loans_and_cant_get/,"I'll start right off saying I'm an idiot for doing all this, but it's over and done with so now I'm just trying to start up again with what I have. 

I'm currently a 22 year old chick trying to go to college. When I was 18, I went to school immediately and did alright, but decided half way through the school year I wanted to go to a different school closer to home. There starts my first mistake. However, being so young and impetuous, I saw no downside to this. I lived at home with my dad for 6 months while going to this second school closer to home, but then decided to move out with a friend to actually live in the college town so I wouldn't have to commute every day. 

At this point I was still going full-time and loving school. Loving moving out. Had plenty of money for what I needed. Doing fine. At some point...the Ohio weather and my roommate and my boyfriend at the time and whatever else...just sent me into a downward spiral that I absolutely quit going to classes, I called off constantly from work, I just sat in my apartment watching television shows on DVD. It was pretty pathetic, but in the end, I came out of it, but not in time to recover my classes. I got kicked out of school due to academic performance. 

It was at that time that my lease was almost up, my roommate and I weren't on great terms anymore, a close friend of mine was moving to Columbus to be with her girlfriend and asked if I wanted to take off from the Cleveland area as well. Being bored and just needing a change and no longer being tied to school, I jumped at the opportunity. The whole move was the best thing I've ever done. 

Sorry this is so long and drawn out, this is my first post to Reddit to seek out assistance. But after the move, I slowly started to weed through my life and get things in order. Now it's a year and a half after I first moved to Columbus and I'm finally ready mentally to tackle school. I love the job I have right now, but I don't want to be doing it indefinitely. Here's where all the technical stuff from my loans and school crap comes in. 

This past quarter I paid for a class at the local community college out of my own pocket. Unfortunately, I simply can't afford to pay out of pocket for me to go full time to school. I can only afford a few hundred and that gets me only half-time. Now, because I took so much time off in between schools and figuring out what I want to do with my life, all of my loans are in repayment. My federal loans are great because I can get all kinds of deferments from them, so they aren't an issue. I do, however, have a loan from Sallie Mae for $8,000 and they want there money. Period. My dad was a co-signer for that loan, so even if I were to not care about my credit...I'd be bashing his if I didn't pay. I've been having so much trouble paying the $200/mo bill for them that I've fallen way behind and hurt both our credit scores. The option that seemed viable was to just apply for another loan through them so I could go back to school full-time. Once in school full-time, my loan from Sallie Mae (and everyone else) would go into automatic in-school deferment. Therefore I would only have one $50/mo payment to Sallie Mae for interest accrued on the loan. That I can manage. 

I put in for that new school loan yesterday and had my dad fill all the paperwork out to co-sign for it again. Got the whole lecture I deserved on how I need to really go through with this all the way this time...the whole thing. At this point...I just want to finish school and I'll do just about anything. The huge downside is that about 45 minutes after my dad submitted his paperwork, I checked online and the status of my new loan application had been changed from ""in-progress"" to ""cancelled."" I have no idea what this means and I am going to call tomorrow to check it out and talk to someone.

If I can't get this loan...I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm just going to be sitting in Ohio, working, with no real direction. To give a small idea of my financial situation currently, I make roughly $1300/ mo between my two jobs. It's not great, though it's not terrible. I have a $153/ mo credit card bill just due to long story, but had to put tuition for a semester on my credit card... (I know, worst mistake.) It looks like I'm going to have a $200/mo bill for Sallie Mae unfortunately...unless I can find some way to get back into school full-time and get it down to $50. I also have rent which is $310, utilities which combined are about $80-$100/ mo. Then there's food, gas, and leisure activities (which I know I can cut down on, but lets face it, I don't do much that actually costs much, so what little funds I have put towards stuff like that, I'd like to keep them...) 

My point in posting this is I have absolutely no idea where to go next. I am going to call Sallie Mae tomorrow and try to talk to a representative to see what's going on with my loan. On the off, but slightly more likely, chance I can't get this loan...what do I do? I know I can apply for scholarships, but under the certain circumstances I've put myself in, not many people would give someone who's flopped around to so many schools a scholarship. I also write well, but not nearly well enough to get actually get a scholarship that way. I know there is also FAFSA, but because I'm under 25 and still have to put my parents on my application, their incomes are still counted. Due to some unfortunate family circumstances when I was a teenager, my dad is digging himself out of a world of debt, He also remarried about two years ago and her douche ex-husband left her completely high and dry and with piles of debt too. So, on paper, my dad and his wife make wayyy too much money for me to actually qualify for any substantial, if any, federal assistance such as loans or work study. Are there other options? What has everyone else done? And to tell you the truth, I'm not completely dead set on going to school. I want to just because I want to move up in my life, but having a degree isn't the most important thing in my life and I have a whole bunch of friends that are graduating now with piles of debt and no job...something I don't necessarily want. 

My goals in life are just to get somewhere coastal in the near future. I was going to put that off for another three years until I was completely done with school...but if there's no school...there's really no reason to wait three years other than to build finances. I want to be stable. I don't have to make a whole hell of a lot or have really nice things, I'm extremely simple. I just need to know what options I actually have if anyone has absolutely ANY advice, I'll take it.

Lyns3fresh,1398988168,/r/college/comments/24hzvv/what_i_want_vs_what_my_parents_want/,"I apologize beforehand if this is a wall of text. Not sure where to begin. Im really in a stressful conflict right now between me and my parents with this whole college process. Im currently a junior in high school so looking at colleges to apply for is the main topic pretty much this year. My parents know this too. I already know what i want to major in: Fine arts/studio arts , cuz im extremely good at drawing, painting, etc. Im familiar with a  number of schools that provide an art  program and shit. But i dont wanna go to a school thats all based on art. I wanna go to a university that provides a number of majors so i can interact with people with other interests besides art so i wouldnt be having to talk about art all day everyday day. My life doesnt revolve around art. Im familiar with other stuff as well. My mom on the other hand keeps telling me about colleges for me that i dont wanna go to or dont have an interest in. And these colleges are all art based colleges and thats exactly what i dont want. I told her why i dont like the idea and she seemed ok with it, but days later she keeps shoving them down my throat like she didnt hear me. So im really getting stressed about this shit and worried that my parents are gunna end up picking out schools im gunna apply to and decide my college for me and shit. 

Now later they go to another level and sign me up for a pre-college program at Carnegie Mellon University over the summer without even talking to me first about it like wtf. I told them i didnt wanna do it because the thing is 6 weeks over the summer which takes up a month more than half my summer. This starts a really heated argument. Since im coming out of my junior year which is honestly the worst/stressful months of my life i wanted to relax this whole summer and not do shit. But my parents are keeping me on my toes shoving this shit down my throat. So this argument goes on for hours. My parents are EXTREMELY hardheaded and narrowminded. I told them i wanna relax for the summer but they call me lazy -__-. I tell them iv never been more stressed in my entire life and they joke about it and tell me that theyre stressed too cuz their adults and shit -__-. The program means i have to stay there for 6 weeks without going home. I miss 4th of July and i might miss a family vacation which im bummed about. But they dont give a fuck. I applied for the program and got a scholarship. Everyone is happy for me except me. 

 They start pressuring me with colleges i dont like, but i dont say anything about it. They think their gunna force me to apply to colleges im not interested in. I told them already of the colleges im interested in and they say ok at first but then they keep shoving these down my throat despite my opinion. I thought since im the one going to college, im the one to choose what i wanna do with my life. Not them. They dont even care about my fuckin opinion about what i want to do with my life. I ask them angrily like ""Doesnt my opinion matter? Isnt it my life?"" and they tell me straight up ""No"". i couldnt believe what they said. Its my fuckin life and i go where i wanna fuckin go and do whatever i want with my future. They say their doing whats 'best for me' but they dont realize that i know whats best with my life as well. 

All my life teachers and other people tell me that IM the one to choose where i wanna go, And to choose wisely what college i wanna apply to and shit like that. MEE. Not my fuckin parents. Their so controlling and overbearing. I told them in the argument that my guidance counselor (male) keeps telling me to ignore what anyone says and do what you wanna do with your life and where youll be the happiest. And their ignorant ass dad says ""Well you tell him that i said no, thats not the way it goes."" -____- . Fucking seriously? They think that since their paying for it that means i have no say in my life whatsoever and my opinion doesnt matter. Shit, their opinion shouldnt matter alot. They think im still a fuckin baby and i cant think for myself and think they can make decisions for me like im their dog instead of their son. My dad always talks to me about when hes gunna die id be nothing and ill have to care of my responsibilities and make adult decisions. He tells me to take care of myself right now like hes already dead and grow the fuck up. College decison-making and applications are the first step of growing up and making adult decisons and hes not even fuckin letting me!!!!!!! such hypocrites. 

Now heres whats pissing me off. I research schools im interested in all the time and look up what their campus is like and the social scene is and shit like that. But I never paid attention the tuition price. Now my parents have been in a financial problem lately and cant pay for much and buy much than they used to with my brother and his school. I know that since my parents are paying for my college i gotta watch out for tuition prices. I cant ignore their financial concerns. My older brother went to RPI for engineering. RPI's tuition is 45,000. My parents paid 45,000 which im sure is pretty expensive for a school. (correct me if im wrong). And im sure they arent able. So i looked up the tuitions for each of my schools i was already interested in:

Syracuse University - $36,300
Quinnipiac University - $38,000
Pace University - $36,000
Temple University - $23,000
Radford University - $20,000
West Virginia University - $19,000

Yes. Radford and WVU are 20,000 and 19,000 believe it or not. Now the colleges that my mom are pressuring me into are in the fuckin $40,000 - $45,000 zone!!! Even Carnegie Mellon is 43,000 like wtf are they even doing?? I dont even think theyre even checking the tuition prices at all. And some of them require at least a 2000 on my SATs and around a 3.8 GPA which im SURE i cannot achieve. With the schools im looking at i might actually have a decent chance besides the one my moms looking at for me. And Radford and WVUs tuitions are MORE THAN HALF of what the tuition is for the art schools and RPI's. Btw they dont know about some of my schools yet. Idk whats going on thru their heads. They really think im a fuckin dummy and cant think for myself when it comes to decisions for college when i just found a reasonable solution to their expected future financial problem. 

Idk wtf to do with them.They dont get that its my fuckin life and my future, not theirs. I cant let them make me miserable for 4 years. I need advice. Sorry for this wall of text. If i sounded retarded and disorganized i apologize. Alot of shits going thru my head right now. Feel free to correct me in things if im totally wrong in the facts i mentioned.

## Finding the right path to be a social worker

How to become a social worker can be a complex question to answer.  It could be argued that anyone who promotes the wellbeing of others is a social worker.  Historically, social work has been a very generic term.  Thanks to the Council of Social Work Education, National Association of Social Workers and other advocacy groups, there are specific requirements for the education of a social worker.

As this path may seem a difficult to navigate, let us help you make simple sense of it!

**There are technically four levels of education, which can be obtained: technician, bachelor, master, and doctorate.  I will be focusing on the bachelor and master levels.**

**In Michigan, the technician has a narrow scope of practice but can operate within an agency and bill Medicaid.**

**If you have specific questions about the technician,** [**contact me**](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/contact/)**.**

## Education of a Social Worker- BSW

The education of a social worker varies.  Minimally, you likely will need a bachelor of social work.  So how do you go about completing the necessary requirements and obtaining your degree and license?

There are a few options for you!

It will be important to evaluate your specific circumstances.  With the forging of online programs, many non-traditional students are returning to pursue their bachelor of social work too.  If you are a non-traditional student, please refer to my post ‘[How to get your MSW while working full time’](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/2018/07/08/2018-7-8-how-to-get-your-msw-while-working-full-time/).

I know!  You have not yet even received your bachelor degree yet.  However, the post will provide you with many details to consider.

The qualifications for a social worker can change between states.  You should always check with your state’s licensing agency.  The scope of practice also changes between states.  You need to know well in advance if you will be able to provide the service you have your heart set on.

### As you might find, the most predominant service provided by a bachelor level social worker is case management.

Case management is a fantastic role to build your foundation.  It touches on nearly every part of advanced practice interventions.  The education of a social worker, at the BSW level, will center on this skill set.

As a side note, the field of substance abuse *sometimes* has more loose standards.  You might be able to obtain a board certification in your state to conduct some types of therapy.

So, you’ve reviewed the licensing requirements and you are ready to begin working towards a career in social work.  You will need to find a Council of Social Work Education accredited program.  There is likely not much variation in the concentrations between programs. 

The education of a social worker is mostly standardized when the school is accredited.  Each school will likely establish a foundation in the intersection of social, psychological, and biological systems.

### If you have an added interest, venture out on your own or talk to your adviser about opportunities.

This can significantly help you when you’re looking for a job.  Most applicants right out of college have nearly no experience.  Therefore, any way that you can expand upon the education of a social worker, it will help set you apart!

If you can add to your resume and skill set- do it! 

While pursuing your bachelor degree, also consider whether you are wanting to go back to school for your MSW or other advanced degree.  The education of a social worker is a long journey!

It is not uncommon for students to take a break.  However, be cautious if you are one of those people that likely won’t return.

You will need to evaluate the benefit of an advanced degree- increased salary, promotion potential, private practice, etc. with burnout, finances, and other personal obligations.

Getting your bachelor of social work will open many doors in mental health, non-profit, and some government positions.  It is also one of the few bachelor level degrees that offer a license to practice.

## The Advanced Education of a Social Worker

The steps to become licensed as a master level social worker are few but time consuming.  These qualifications for social workers are the same at both the micro and macro levels.

First, you must graduate from a Council of Social Work Education accredited program.  There are many ways to do this.  I highly encourage you check your local area and online.

Certainly, it is in your best interest to take your licensing exam following graduation!  Your schooling is fresh in your mind and your chances of success are much better. 

If you have not yet done so, I also suggest you obtain full time employment working as a limited licensed social worker.

As a rule of thumb, each year of full time employment is equivalent to 2,000 hours.  Most states require 4,000 hours at minimum to receive your LCSW.

Therefore, it cannot be stressed enough, check with your state’s licensing agency!

### Your full license is the goal- don’t flounder it with laziness near the finish line.

Each state will have its own requirements on how long you can go without obtaining your full license.  In Michigan, we have 7 years to get our full license.

Clinical supervision is a keystone of social work.  Therefore, when searching for full time employment, there will be a number of considerations.  Ask your potential employer about clinical supervision.  If they offer free supervision, I would consider that to to be an added perk to any benefit’s package.

The education for a social worker can be very expensive, so here is an unrelated tip!  Find out if the employer would qualify for the [National Health Service Corp](https://nhsc.hrsa.gov/loan-repayment/benefits.html).

They can pay up to $75,000 simply for committing to the job for at least three years!  For more details, check out my post on [student loan hacks](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/best-resource-list/)!

The cost of contracted supervision can be upwards of $100/ hour or more.  Expect to complete one hour of clinical supervision per 40 hours. 

If you are contracting your supervision, shop around! Check with your state’s National Association of Social Work chapter before agreeing to an independent contractor.

If you are considering returning to school for your MSW, I highly suggest you read my blog ‘[How to get your MSW while working full time](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/2018/07/08/2018-7-8-how-to-get-your-msw-while-working-full-time/)‘.  It will provide a road map for success in achieving your degree with a family and job.

Before you make any commitments, evaluate your options and school placements.  Any school that is accredited by the Council of Social Work Education will have similar qualifications for emerging social workers.

### The end goal of obtaining your full licensure can be a long road.

I encourage you to stick with it.  The field needs great people.  A sure sign that you may be one of them is that you’re reading this post.  If you have other questions, check out these [10 traits to see how you fit](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/2018/08/15/10-traits-mental-health-careers/).

As a social worker who has stumbled through the process, I can tell you that it’s all worth it.  If you have specific questions, please [contact me](https://www.thehowtosocialworker.com/contact/)!  Though our field will continually be over-worked and under-paid, it is critical and amazing work.  Take the plunge into social work.  Do not let the education and qualifications to be a social worker discourage you!

minervajones123,1594610092,/r/college/comments/hq7rvp/on_my_second_leave_of_absence_from_a_prestigious/,"I went from my being one of the top students in my department during my first year, winning prizes and even being encouraged by my professors to publish, during my year, to one of the most disappointing, lowest achieving, most worrisome and inconsistent student probably on the whole campus. 

I don’t even know what year I am in anymore. I’ve lost count. I think I’ve been at college for a total of three and half semesters, but I’ve taken so many incompletes, withdrawals and even Fs that I’m afraid to look at my transcript anymore unless I absolutely need to. I’m too ashamed, it hurts to look at. 

I took my first leave of absence after just one semester at college. I started out so strong right away and absolutely adored my classes and my professors, and wrote two of the best essays I’ve ever written to date, but by the end of that first semester things had begun rapidly going downhill. I’m still not sure what happened, if it was laziness, ADHD, ADHD medication, poor study habits or a more serious mental illness but I was barely function by the end of that semester. I had literally no friends, but I didn’t mind. I had become obsessed with my English and philosophy classes, and was starting to see all of these amazing connections between everything I was studying, but totally neglected my French class which I ended up failing. I was staying up all night pacing around the campus, developing all of these theories, checking out thirty books from the library at a time, not really eating much or socializing ever, hooked on cigarettes and obsessed with one of my profs. I was making so many bad decisions but I was also really having a good time in my own little world in my head. But I was barely able to write a coherent sentence. My papers were starting to become more and more rambling and I wasn’t finishing them on time, sometimes at all. I eventually, slowly, developed a strange and elaborate paranoid delusion about my favorite professors and became very depressed about it, so much so that I felt unable to stay at school, even though being at home was the last place I thought I’d ever want to be. I decided to take a leave of absence. I didn’t tell anyone about the delusion because I was afraid of what would happen if I did, and at that point I had no idea it was a delusion. During my leave of absence I went to intensive outpatient therapy and was diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar disorder and prescribed abilify and Wellbutrin, which my mom didn’t want me to take so I never took. Later they would take back the bipolar diagnosis. And then give it back to me and then take it back again. 

My delusion eventually went away after a long time and after telling therapist about it finally and being shocked into reality. I went back to college in the fall, and did okay. I stayed for spring. Did okay but struggled, barely keeping my head above water. 

My mental health declined gradually the next couple of semesters, and I was never as motivated or brilliant as I was that first semester. I wasn’t doing any of my work or getting out of bed. I was obsessed with life memories of my father French kissing me as a child and could not stop thinking about it. I got a little paranoid and even called the police because I thought my roommate was being sexually assaulted but apparently she was listening to music. I started to believe I was suffering from all sorts of terrible diseases. Eventually I became so stressed and depressed and confused that I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days. There was given abilify and had such a bad reaction to it I nearly died. But I didn’t seem as unhealthy as the other people there and to this day I don’t think I deserve to get any slack because I feel like my problems are mostly my fault. 

I’m on my second medical leave now and I’m living with my mom, working at a restaurant. I just share my money with my mom who doesn’t work. We don’t have a house of our own and just bounce between a bunch of places. It can be stressful at times. I’m worried I’ll never be able to succeed. It’s been four years and nothing has changed or been clarified or resolved. It just keeps getting worse and I lose motivation every day. My future looks nonexistent.

I just took a class online which I barely passed but I did. I feel like such an enormous failure. I am still living with my mom at 23. I can’t even drive. I am hooking up with this guy who won’t actually be my boyfriend and even though it makes me feel bad Im afraid to end things or ask for more emotional support. I think he came inside me, and didn’t tell me, and got me pregnant. I had to have a medical abortion a couple weeks ago and didn’t tell anyone. My mom would have murdered me. I don’t know how he would react. I feel so guilty about all of this. I’m such a fuck up. 

I still don’t really have a diagnosis except depression and anxiety. I’m on depression meds and they help. A lot of psychs that I’ve been to try to prescribe me antipsychotics but I’m really afraid of them and my mom is skeptical of mental health field in general. She doesn’t like any of the therapists I’ve been to. I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because she gets upset when I do it seems. Right now I’m not seeing anyone, and just being prescribed antidepressants and add meds by my regular doctor, my mom tells me not to tell them everything because they’ll make me see a psychiatrist who we can’t afford and who will make me take meds that are dangerous. And im scared to be honest since I had such a scary reaction to antipsychotic medication last time and my blood pressure dropped so low. But I need the approval of a psych to go back to school. Right now it feels like I will never be ready to go back. And my mom needs my help here as well. And I’ve already wasted so much of my family and my university’s money. And the states money (during my hospital stay). 

I am likely going to need 2 more full years to graduate. Right now I am on my SECOND leave of absence. I’m amazed they haven’t just kicked me out yet. My dean says my professors say I’m brilliant and they believe in me but I think she’s just saying that to be nice. It’s a very expensive liberal arts college am on a ton of financial aid so I’m taking up the college’s resources. Everyone believes in me and has invested so much into me and I disappoint them time after time after time. I’m so ashamed and afraid. I can’t even walk down the halls of my university without feeling shame. All the profs know a little about my situation and have been so supportive and helpful and given me breaks and I have let them down time after time. 

Truth is I love college and want to go back so badly but I don’t think at this point I deserve another chance.",college,On my second leave of absence from a prestigious college and feeling like a failure,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hq7rvp/on_my_second_leave_of_absence_from_a_prestigious/,1594631692.0,school is too expensive,8.44
cockadoodlenoodles,1538805521,/r/college/comments/9ltqys/i_feel_like_i_could_be_getting_so_much_more_out/,"Alright, so this might get a bit long.  (edit: yep, it did)

So, a preface: I lived in a dorm room my freshman year of college. It was a smaller, private (christian) university which i'm not really a fan of, but the living experience was nice and unique. I mean, it wasn't for me really specifically &amp; personally, because my roommate was never around, and whenever she *was* around (literally only 5 or 6 days the entire academic year did she ever actually stay in the room and stay overnight), she wasn't a big fan of me...

...but, that's all besides the point: Mostly everyone in the building loved their living experience, because everyone was friendly and social and connected with each other, lots of people always kept their doors opened, there was a lot of Hall events in the main lobby/lounge areas, or Floor/Wing events, where floors/wings would go to things with each other like campus events or have a designated night each week where everyone would go eat in the dining hall together, etc. 

Since my roommate was hardly ever around and I felt kind of out of place at this university, I hardly ever actually *did* any of that stuff except for a couple of events/outings during my first semester. But, nonetheless, I was still appreciative of and acknowledged how tight everyone on each floor was with each other and how everyone was mostly friendly to each other. Especially now, I realize how much i'd appreciate it and, looking back, I wish I would've appreciated it more. 

For my sophomore year, I transferred to a primarily commuter school in the big city. I definitely *wanted* to live in an official on-campus residence hall, but my transfer stuff didn't get accepted soon enough so by the time I was officially accepted to the university, on-campus housing was full. Since I was kind of weary of the idea of signing a lease and living in an apartment with a stranger in an unfamiliar area (I didn't really know anyone at this new university), I just got a 1BD/BR apartment literally right next to campus (actually this apartment complex was *literally* right next to the on-campus housing building I live in now). 

In my one-bedroom apartment, it got pretty lonely.... I am an introvert and I definitely need and appreciate having solitude, but I got so tired of it being my life all the time. I was friendly with and had acquaintances in my classes so I wasn't totally alone all the time every hour of every day, but I was by myself way too much of the time. I knew life isn't supposed to be lived like this; people are meant to share experiences with other people and live among each other! But I was doing so much stuff by myself. Living, eating, walking to class, driving, going to the movies, etc. I know i'm not supposed to be living like this and I know there is so much more you're supposed to get out of your college experience.

So, that lasted for a year and a half. My lease ended in October of 2017. I was casually looking for roommates (or at least apartments nearby that placed you with other roommates who applied to live there too) but, me and my family (who help with my college expenses) decided that it would be best to try and see if i could get on-campus housing again. So, i luckily got offered and then accepted a room in the same residence hall that i had always walked past outside of my apartment complex every day, I extended my lease for just 2 more months at my apartment to the end of the fall semester, and then in January, I moved into on-campus housing.

I had always envied people who lived in this hall and on-campus in general, and actually got to have that on-campus dorm living experience. So,  I was pretty amped to live on-campus again, to meet new people and finally make friends in my hall on my floor! 

Well, let's just cut to the chase and say that went to shit pretty soon after i moved in. My new roommate  and I were totally cool with each other and never really had any problems, but she was never there and I hardly ever saw her (probably only 4-5 times the entire semester...... much like my roommate in my freshman year at my previous university). 

The on-campus residence hall experience was nothing like it was at my old school. Now, this *is* a completely different kind of school than my old one -- way bigger, way more diverse, people who go/live here live many different lifestyles than the students at my old university that I lived with did -- but, still, i'm quite disappointed. 

I obviously pay a lot of money to live here, and I know you can't force people to be friends just because they live in the same building as you, but, still........ Not counting my roommate, I only know the names of like 2 other people on my entire floor, tops. I think that's a bit ridiculous. 

Also, our RA we originally had at the start of the semester is different than the one we have now, and I haven't &amp; I don't even actually think *anyone* on our floor has even formally *met* our RA. I barely saw him and said like two words to him (maybe?) the day he was moving in, but other than that, nothing. At all. *Is that* ridiculous? Redditors, was your on-campus experience with your RA anything like this, where they were completely absent and you don't even know them at all, and they never do anything as a floor, etc?

Our floor as a GroupMe group chat, but hardly anyone ever talks in it. Sometimes I consider asking people if they wanna hang or go eat or go to on-campus events (there are organizations that host fun activities to go to like movies, game nights, etc. every week) in it, but I feel like that may be awkward at this point in the semester since we already don't know any of each other and it might make me even just look desperate. (Not gonna lie though, I kind of am lol.) I mean, other people on my floor already have friends that they hang out with, and that's fine, but as you can tell if you've read this whole thing..... i've kind of had an abnormal college experience (partially my fault, but this is the way it is nonetheless) and I moved on-campus so that i could make friends and live around other people who I went to school with. And i'm not getting that at all. I feel like I could be getting so much more out of my on-campus living experience.

So,... Thoughts?! I've considered reaching out to my RA and suggesting some ideas to help our floor residents be more connected and friendly with each other (like movie nights, game nights, dinner at the campus dining hall outings on a designated day each week, etc.) like my old dorm at my old school used to have. Should I? Or should I just go for it and try to facilitate these things on my own and just go to try and meet people on my floor? Or should I do a mixture of both?

Yep, this ended up being so long. Ugh. Please, if anyone out there reads through all this, please help and give me advice. I am desperate here!!",college,I feel like I could be getting so much more out of my on-campus living experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9ltqys/i_feel_like_i_could_be_getting_so_much_more_out/,1538827121.0,can't pay for school,8.433333333333334
clueless24,1316750332,/r/AskReddit/comments/kopac/i_thought_my_boyfriend_suckeduntil_he_broke_up/,"My ex boyfriend and I dated for nearly 5 years, starting halfway through our first year in college. He was the party animal of the dorm, and I the quiet honor student. At some point we crossed paths, and he happened to like what he saw. We ended up drinking together with a group of people one night and got to talking after everyone else had gone to bed. I stayed in his dorm room every night after that for over a month. We never did anything intimate; we simply enjoyed talking to one another and spending every possible minute together. Despite this, I was hesitant to date him because of our differences. He smoked, loved getting high, and couldn't care less about actually getting a degree; he was there for the social part of college life. I, on the other hand, already knew I'd end up in grad school, I despised all drugs (including marijuana even though I don't understand why it's illegal), and I wanted someone who I could count on the be more responsible. He asked me out numerous times, and I rejected him without pause. Ultimately though, it came to a point where I started believing his promises to change and my feelings for him were way too strong to ignore. We started dating, and 5 years later he broke my heart.

To sum up our current status:

Me - I got my undergrad degree and am now a grad student getting my doctorate in physical therapy. I work part time on campus, but kept the weekends free for traveling since the ex moved to a city 3 hours away.

Him - He has completed a total of less than 30 credit hours despite registering and paying for approximately 8 semesters of college. He recently moved to a bigger city to pursue a degree in photography, but he dropped out after one semester. He now is highly interested in music production and is learning on his own quite successfully, but with his history of changing interests I'm not sure how long it will last. He was fired last month from his most recent job at a fast food restaurant - one of the many times he has been fired from pretty low demanding jobs. He has never had money or any sort of savings; rather he is dependent on his grandparents to pay for rent, food, utilities, etc. I also would chip in and help out whenever they couldn't, which I know now was a huge mistake.

Our Problems:
I hated his complete lack of motivation, responsibility, and dependability. While I'd spend hundreds of dollars on presents or create something special for his birthday and other holidays, he'd either forget these times altogether or I'd get some thing ridiculous (such as being handed a $20 bill in the middle of the mall while purchasing a phone on my birthday). He promised to quite smoking and partying so much, but he's almost 24 now and still goes out 3-4 days a week and gets high several times a day every day. Besides going out, he never leaves the house. He's too lazy to apply for jobs or register for class. Every time we see each other, we can't do anything besides sit on the couch and watch netflix unless I pay for us both, which I can't afford often after doing this for so long. I can't remember the last time he took me out for something as simple as dinner and a movie, or even treated me to anything really. We are on the same cell phone contract, and every month I have to cover both of our halves until he figures out a way to get extra money from a family member. And worst of all, he seems to have forgotten what personal hygiene is. He sweats constantly, but only takes showers every other day. When he doesn't shower, he doesn't change clothes. His shirts, shorts, jeans, etc all have holes, dog hair, and food stains on them since doing the laundry requires moving away from the computer screen and any extra money goes toward marijuana and/or Mcdonald's. I'm not sure if I covered everything, but I think that's enough. He ended up being a complete bum and I couldn't stand it. However, I had my own faults. I'd keep all of these things that bothered me to myself and then almost every time I drank my true feeling would come spurting out. I'd get so drunk I'd black out and wake up not knowing what happened. He'd tell me all the horrible things I said to him each time: over and over on these drunken nights I'd insult him incessantly and in ways that really can't be forgiven. I said things to him that I'd never say to my worst enemy. I berated him, treated him like shit, and even went so far as to slap him a couple different times. When he'd explain to me what I said and what I did, I'd feel physically sick about it. I couldn't believe I could be so cruel. I love him more that anything in the world, and I hurt him so bad. I'd apologize profusely every time, but sorry finally lost its meaning.

The breakup:
He drove the 3 hours here to see me one weekend and we went out the first night with a couple friends. We both drank heavily and I started an argument at some point, per usual. Things escalated and I turned into a drunk, evil bitch yet again. The next morning I woke up to him walking out my door. I called him and he told me he can't deal with my behavior anymore and it's over for good. I had no argument; I can't deny that I too would leave if I was being treated that way.

Now:
It's been almost a month and every minute of every single day seems to stretch on forever. I miss him. He was my best friend, my love, and my partner for what I thought would be life. I try to focus on his shortcomings and all his faults as a boyfriend, but my mind keeps reverting back to the happiest memories we had together. His personality is truly one of a kind, he has an incredibly good heart, we shared a wonderful sense of humor, and he truly cared for me although he had a lot of trouble showing it. I'd do anything in the world for him and he knows it, but he's through with me. I know we sound like the worst match in the world, and we probably are, but my feelings for him are so intense still that I can't imagine ever finding a better love.

My Question: Has anyone ever been through something somewhat similar to this? I'm having so much trouble moving on. Part of me is still hoping he'll want me back at some point, but a larger part of me knows it'll never happen. Is there anything I can do, or is this a hopeless situation?

TL;DR - After almost 5 years together, my boyfriend finally broke up with me for my verbal, and sometimes physical, abuse while drinking. I'll be getting my doctorate next year while he is going nowhere in life, has no money, no job, no education, etc and his only priority in life seems to be getting high and frequenting raves. Still, I'm having trouble letting go. Is there anyone whose gone through something similar? Any suggestions on how to move on?

I'd do anything in the world for him and he knows it, but he's through with me. I know we sound like the worst match in the world, and we probably are, but my feelings for him are so intense still that I can't imagine ever finding a better love.

My Question: Has anyone ever been through something somewhat similar to this? I'm having so much trouble moving on. Part of me is still hoping he'll want me back at some point, but a larger part of me knows it'll never happen. Is there anything I can do, or is this a hopeless situation?

TL;DR - After almost 5 years together, my boyfriend finally broke up with me for my verbal, and sometimes physical, abuse while drinking. I'll be getting my doctorate next year while he is going nowhere in life, has no money, no job, no education, etc and his only priority in life seems to be getting high and frequenting raves. Still, I'm having trouble letting go. Is there anyone whose gone through something similar? Any suggestions on how to move on?

tdishman,1264005029,/r/AskReddit/comments/arz6g/my_sons_best_friend_is_dying_and_his_parochial/,"OK, this is a lengthy story, so bear with me.

My son is in 7th grade, and used to attend a Catholic middle school.  I'm a non-believer, but the public school system in my district is horrible - we have since moved and are in a much better school district and our kids are no longer enrolled in that private school.

My son's best friend has Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy.  For the uneducated it is an awful disease that slowly degrades the muscles in your body.  He has been wheelchair bound for the past several years, and now he is starting to have trouble raising a glass to take drinks on his own.  It's an awful condition, and there's an extremely high likelihood that he won't survive to graduate high school.

His family is far from wealthy.  His mom's first husband died (not sure what the problem was), her second husband also died (his father) when the son was only 3 years old, and his older brother died in the Iraqi war post 9/11.  So, to recap, his mom has lost 2 husbands and one son already, and will probably lose her youngest son long before she herself dies (she has a middle son who is perfectly normal).

Sometime last year his mom flew him to the Dominican Republic to have a set of experimental surgeries or treatments that was supposed to help restore some of his muscular capacity so he could feed himself, play video games without pain, etc.  The catch is that the treatment in a roundabout way involved some sort of stem cell research.  The school he attends is in an uproar.

The priest at the church/school sent her a letter expressing his dismay.  I haven't seen or read the letter, but from what I understand it was very unkind.

The school has now suddenly decided that she makes too much money to qualify for financial aid, and is requiring her to pay $675/mo for her son to continue to go there.  That $675 includes current tuition as well as back tuition because they decided she should retroactively pay for the last school year as well.  They threatened to kick her son out of school if she cannot pay.  Her son has been enrolled there his entire life, so the friends in his class remember him from when he could still walk and play on the playground.

My wife and I have helped the mom out as much as we've been able to over the years.  We helped them out with Christmas presents the last few years, and if I could afford it I would gladly pay for the schooling just to force the church's hand.  They (the church) know that she cannot afford to pay the bills, and are just waiting for the opportunity to make a bigger deal out of it.

Unfortunately our kids don't live very close anymore (we moved probably 30 miles away to get into a good school district, but the kids spend the night together atleast 3 times per month).  Otherwise I would recommend that she leave the school and transfer into our school where her son would atleast have a friend he can lean on.  She cannot afford to move closer to us.

It sounds bad, but I'm less concerned with helping my son's friend (they're much better off without the church involved), and more interested in sticking it to the church somehow.  While my kids attended they forced my (then) 6th grader to write a letter to newly elected president Obama to repeal any stem-cell research legislation.  This was a mandatory homework assignment, and my son refused to turn it in.  They (the church) also fired the kindergarten teacher because she got her master's degree (she wasn't asking for more money, but they fired her anyway so they wouldn't feel obligated to pay her more).

So, in closing, what would Reddit do in this situation?  

**Edit:** I have not talked to the mother at all about doing anything.  I have considered going to the local news, but I suspect she would not be on board with any further attention (likely because it probably won't help her son at all).

**Edit 2:** (removed)

**Edit 3:** I got more details on the story, and its a little different from what I stated earlier (no better or worse I think, but for the sake of being thorough and honest I need to make some corrections).  I got the mom's side of the story and there are a few details that I need to elaborate.  First off, I found out she never was on financial aid from the church, she has been repeatedly denied aid (she applies every year).  The $675 the school wants is to cover the tuition plus the balance she already owes from this school year (she could only pay $2000 at the beginning of the year, and was hoping she could get financial aid because of the new medical expenses she incurred).  Where the plot thickens is that (this is her opinion, but I have met the people in question and I have no reason to doubt her) the treasurer of the school, with whom she has all of her financial dealings, is a lawyer who also handled the estate of her son when he died.  This lawyer/treasurer knows her financial status (she received no life insurance when her son died because he was married and with a child), and knows she cannot truly afford private schooling.  The lawyer/treasurer is also physically abusive towards his wife &amp; kids (again, her words, but she's friends with his wife, and they apparently share that information), and it is her opinion that he knows that *she* knows, and is trying to ""strongarm"" her out.  It is this lawyer/treasurer that has denied her requests for financial aid.

In a nutshell, the school is forcing her to pay full tuition plus backpayments or else they will kick her son out.  Under normal circumstances I can't find any fault in this, but it seems to me that as a church you could single this out as extraordinary circumstances.

I also found out a little more info about the letter she received from the priest.  She has held many fundraisers to raise money for her son's medical treatments, and the priest does not want any advocation of anything having to do with stem cell research.  He did threaten excommunication if she screws up (I did not read the letter, and I'm not sure what his terms were).

I also removed the link to the article I posted, because I've decided that I am not comfortable sharing any names or locations with anyone.  If you've already read the article I obviously cannot get you to ""unread"" it, but I'm not looking for the Reddit mob to take independent action.

**Edit 4:** Many have commented that he should just quit school.  This was my initial reaction when I first heard of his condition several years ago.  While remote, there is an outside chance that he could live well into his 40's or 50's.  Also, for better or worse, this school, the kids in it, and the activities surrounding it are his life.  I can totally understand why he (and his mom) would be resistive to removing him from school.  I know she doesn't hold him to the same educational standards as his older brother(s), but she tries to treat him like any other kid (and I'm sure that's the way he wants it).",AskReddit,"My son's best friend is dying, and his parochial school wants to kick him out because of the treatment he tried.

So, I’m surfin the fucking web on my lunch break at work (Stumble upon, you addictive bastard) when I come across [this fucking atrocity](http://www.globalrichlist.com/). But, I was beguiled at first by the snazzy background. So, I read on. “That’s cool,” I think. “I wonder where I am on the global scale.” So I punch in my meager yearly income of $25,000 buckaroos a year. “Well, would you look at those big fucking fonts? Looks like I’m in the top 10% of the worl. . .” Then it hits me. This bullshit is asking for some of my money. I should have known from the fucking beginning that someone would be wanting into my pants before the end of lunch. Fucking assholes want me to give up MY hard earned money for some people I don’t know. Well, let me tell you why emotional appeals don’t work on me, you snarky fucking cunts. Listen the fuck up.

First of all, your stupid calculator always intended to make me feel rich. Anyone with internet is considered rich to them. While I was in the [top 10%](http://imgur.com/a/cAgzW#1) of the world according to this site, someone who made only $5000 a year would still be in the top 14%. WHO THE FUCK CARES. Do you know how much fucking money it takes to LIVE in the United States? Especially in the testicle shriveling SoCal? A one bedroom apartment often exceeds $1000 a month in rent. Food and gas expenses exceed $500 a month just going to and from work and eating pasta and beans (this included MANY mandatory bus trips because gas is too expensive). NO MEATS. NO FRESH VEGETABLES. NO FRESH FRUIT. How do I know? BECAUSE THAT’S HOW I LIVED FOR A YEAR! By the way, apples, NON ORGANIC APPLES, are about $1.30 per pound at the run-of-the-mill grocery store, or $0.50 - $0.75 a piece. Organic apples are NOT EVER $0.53 a piece (8/15). ARE YOU FUCKING HIGH OR JUST AN ASSHOLE? Staying in an apartment for a year (not including moving costs because they either kick you out at 12 months or increase your rent by more than 20%) comes to $18000 if all you do is go to work/school and eat dried grains and beans. If you have insurance (apartment, car, life, health, ect), car payments (because in SoCal you NEED a car. It is NOT a luxury), bills (because I’ve had to live off of a credit card before, racking up thousands of dollars in 24% interest debt just to eat and go to work) you’re just right and proper fucked. $18,000 barely cuts it. $25,000 barely cuts it! 10% my fat ass. 

Some other problems I have with your little infomercial. . .

[$8 for 25 fruit trees?](http://imgur.com/a/cAgzW#3) WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU GETTING THAT FROM?! Where in the fucking world can you get 25 fruit trees for $8? NOT ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. Let me break this down, because I’m sure some of you reading this are already tracking that shit down to prove me wrong. Outside of buying them in gross numbers, that statistic is impossible in more than the monetary way. The only way to find that many “fruit trees” for that price is to buy a fuck-ton of them, super young, from a huge nursery that deals in volume. That being said, these wouldn’t be fruit bearing plants. Most fruiting trees take between 5 – 10 years to reach a fruiting age. So, how much good does this do the supposed farmer? NONE. The statement implies, however, that the trees in question are already fruit bearing! So, where in the FUCKING world can you find 25 fruit bearing trees for $8? Let me know, because I’d start a fucking tree farm right the fuck now. 

$73 for a “new” cellphone? NO. New cellphones, if not on a 2 year contract deal, are between $300 and $700. Remember, we’re talking NEW here. Implied by the statements on this website. And what the FUCK is a mobile health clinic? Does it disseminate HIV treatment drugs? How’s that going? [In America, the average HIV treatments for a patient is $367,134](http://www.avert.org/america.htm) for their remaining life span (usually around 12 years). Somehow, I don’t believe that your $73 “Mobile Health Clinic” is doing anything to help “Aids orphans in Uganda”. CAN THERE BE A MORE MANIPULATIVE SENTENCE?! Read it again, “Aids orphans in Uganda”. AIDS. ORPHANS. UGANDA. . .  JESUS FUCKING FUCK. FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING TWAT!

Lastly, is the $2400 for teaching an entire generation of Angolan children. . . ARE YOU RETARDED?! There is NO WAY that that is possible. What is your idea of education? That’s one year for one class IF YOU’RE FUCKING JESUS.

This little emotional appeal to get my money doesn’t even list what percentage is going to costs and what percentage is going to the tools for the needy. Furthermore, all of these sentences say the word “could”. Not “will buy”. Only “could”. There isn’t even a fucking PROMISE that you’ll help the needy with my money. 

And this is the clincher for me, folks. If the people who set up this PIECE OF SHIT WEBSITE really and truly wanted to help, they would dedicate all of their extra time in making money to donate themselves instead of ASKING OTHER TO DO IT FOR THEM! I would bet that the person who runs this website (or part of the foundation blah blah blah) lives comfortably on the money you give them while getting NonProfit funds from the Feds as well and giving about 10% of it to some other charity to take where its filtered again and then sent out for aid. Lets [TAKE A FUCKING LOOK, SHALL WE?](http://www.care.org/about/financialinfo/990_fy2011.pdf) 

According to their tax forms, and I’m just giving a cursory glance here, they have 654 employees and claimed approximately $192 MILLION was paid in employee salary. Some simple math here says that if every person in the charity was paid equally amounts (which I highly doubt) that would be just over $290,000 per year for each of the 654 employees. WOW! WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU'RE USING MY FUCKING MONEY TO BECOME RICH!? 

According to their own website, [they constitute 0.001%](http://imgur.com/a/cAgzW#6) of the richest motherfuckers in the god damn world. While I’m only in the top 10%. Tell you what. Why don’t you drop down to $25000 a year like me, live in an apartment in SoCal, and give the rest of your butt fucking salary to your own charity. You useless lamprey fucks. 

Just to finish this up, once you reach the 0.001%, [it doesn't matter how much money you make.](http://imgur.com/a/cAgzW#4) 10000000000000(ect) always peaks at 107,000 richest in the world. So, they don't care to take the calculations to the far end. Obviously built to lure the middle class citizen. And in the other direction, I put in $5000 annual income to see where it took me on this magical journey. Well, fancy that, you're still in the [top 14%.](http://imgur.com/a/cAgzW#5).

So, in conclusion, FUCK YOU, YOU WORTHLESS THIEF OF A CON ARTIST! I HOPE ALL YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ARE BORN RETARDED AND I HOPE THAT YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR FUCKING LIFE FORGETTING YOUR CHILDREN'S’ NAMES WHILE YOU SHIT YOUR PANTS ON THE WAY TO THE TOILET YOU SPINELESS, SELFISH, COWARDLY MOTHERFUCKERS!

Dr_Bearclaw,1350914594,/r/AskReddit/comments/11w8tn/can_reddit_help_me_understand_what_i_need_to_do/,"First off I would like to say that this is my first reddit post. I have been lurking for a couple years and I finally decided to buck up and create an account...so here goes nothing. This might be a little bit of a read, so sorry for that in advance.

I went to a small private school for most of my life, like a less than 500 student kind of school. I was there from second grade until I graduated and got to grow up with some amazing people. Early on it was rough, I was made fun of a lot, only had maybe a handful of friends, the usual woe is me type school story. Through lower, middle, and high school, I had probably 2-3 friends that I really bonded with. 

Fast forward to high school. I seemed pretty universally liked, got along great with all of the faculty and basically everyone seemed happy to see me whenever. I wasn't exactly a bully, but no one messed with me; ever. I was the big guy, 6'3'' 300 lbs. Not hugely fat I had plenty of muscle to back it up, but all in all I was just a big dude. Since I was so tall, everything got distributed pretty normally. 

So my best friend of whom I have known since third grade through all of high school, gets accepted to the same college as me. He was a sweet dude, nicest guy you'd ever meet. He was king of all mooches but we got along good. We both thought, that we'd room together, it'll be great. Well I was the typical christian 'do no drugs', 'smoke no tobacco', good hearted, clean, dude. Not christian as overly in your face or anything, but that gives some context as to the environment that I was raised in. Anyhow, my best friend is the polar opposite of me, does lots of drugs, smokes, polar opposite politically, but he was a good guy at the core. Opposites attract, who knew. Well I don't want to say it was his fault for exposing me to that type of culture, but he defiantly had something to do with it. Through college I drink, smoke, and do drugs heavily. Make note because of this, college for me lasts all of 6 months. I get done half of a semester, fail out, and go home.

Slightly depressed from pissing away 40 grand (yeah I went to a fucking expensive school) of my family's money, my drinking/drug/partying pretty much goes into a downward spiral for the next 3 years. I become addicted to painkillers pretty bad, and basically end up doing every drug under the sun a LOT. I feel terrible, every day gets harder. I needed something to bring me up out of my funk, but little did I know it kept digging me deeper and deeper into depression. 

Summer of last year I was diagnosed with some weird kind of Fistualizing Chron's Disease. The bad kind, the kind that from what my doctors tell me only 3%-8% of Chron's patients have. The medicines they give me, I get horrific reactions to (and almost kicked the bucket from) leave me taking some pretty heavy doses of steroids and other blah blah blah bad things that destroy my immune system. Needless to say I was pretty bummed out on THAT news. I had unbearable pain for over a year. Constant, biting, stabbing pain. I was self medicating with drugs, to try and trying to stay positive, but it was hard. I try and come off as cheerful to my family, but honestly I am pretty much broken. I had to have surgery maybe 4 months ago and get 1/2 my colon and almost 2 feet of small intestine taken out, and was in the hospital for 18 days. I had 1 visitor the entire time. With my previous addiction to pain killers, the IV dilaudid, oxycotin, vicodin, tramadol, percocet,  smorgasbord that they had me on kept my depression pretty well subdued for my time in the hospital.

Fast forward to maybe a week after my release. I was given dilaudid pills for the pain post surgery, and I'm not gonna lie, they took me to a pretty dark place. I started having uncontrollable urges to off myself. My brain would just tell me to kill myself over and over, and my rational side would say no brain, that's silly, don't do that. I would see evil looking demonic images when I closed my eyes and when I slept. Whenever I would dream they would be horrific painful (I had never experienced actual pain in a dream before until now), and absolutely terrifying experiences. Some nights I would be constantly stabbed, and cut, and tortured for hours on end. Some nights I would be in hell, some nights I was too scared to sleep at all and would just lie awake hoping that the next day I could put my 'everything is ok' mask back on so I didn't have to think about it anymore, no way out, I'm talking like really dark unpleasant stuff here folks. 

Anyhow, I stopped taking the pain meds, quit all drug use, most of my smoking, the whole lot, and have started to get a hold of my life again. I relized though that throughout this whole experience, none of my friends have been there for me. Which as the go to guy for all of them for literally my entire life, had me starting to get that sinking feeling in my stomach again. I was there for them during their darkest times. Through drug addiction, being kicked out of the military, accidental pregnancies, you name it; but none of them had been there for me when I needed them most. They were there for the parties, the drugs, they were there for my money, and for my inebriated company. But no one wants to be around me sober; and honestly I don't know if I want to stay sober. 

Fast forward to maybe a month ago. I am going to visit one of my friends at a bar, she's the bartender there, so I get loaded pretty quick. End up driving home, getting pulled over, and receive a DUI, DWI, possession of cdc / paraphernalia to top off my already shitty year. I am now stuck at home on a suspended license, have lost my job as a cook in a fine dining restaurant, have no money / no means to get anywhere, and to top all of that off my best 'friend' who earlier I talked about knowing from third grade through my brief stint in college, is moving to Florida. 

I am alone, can go no where, have no money to spend, am trying to fight a debilitating disease, trying to recover from surgery and a pretty hefty drug addition, I'm trying to quit smoking (though I still sneak one here and there), have no desire to go back to school, no friends i can really confide in, my last girlfriend cheated on me and I still have never really gotten over it, and generally feel like I've hit rock bottom.

What do I have to do to bring some hope back into my life?

jiganto,1264789907,/r/AskReddit/comments/avrws/reddit_since_youre_so_smart_maybe_you_can_give_me/,"Mr. Reddit, since I've joined, I've seen you dish out some valuable life advice to quite a few people in need. I now find myself troubled by my brother and I'm not quite sure of what I can do, if anything.

I am 23, my brother is 26. We weren't very close growing up, and now that I'm out of the house, I almost never talk to him. My brother has never been particularly good looking or athletic, he's not very smart, not talented, nor very hard-working/determined/inspired. He hasn't had a great childhood; he was teased and made fun of quite a bit when he was young. He always did poorly in school; he had some terrible grade-school teachers, and only graduated high-school out of pity from his counselor. My parents paid for him to attend a technical school because he said he wanted to become a car mechanic. He was kicked out after 1 year because he wasn't attending classes. He told me at the time that electrical systems were too hard for him. We didn't find out he was in trouble until he got kicked out. He would leave every morning, pretending to go to class, and apparently he was just hanging out with his friends. After that, he worked as a painter for a while and that was too physically straining for him, so he quit. My mom got him a job working with her at a cab company answering phones. He did that for a few years, but the company was having financial troubles and wasn't paying on time, he also felt he wasn't paid enough and was also constantly arguing with my mom. He quit that job, and hasn't had one since (2 years).

Part of the reason he hasn't gotten another job is because he's been in perpetual legal trouble for some years now. He's been regularly smoking weed for years now, but he hasn't been very smart about it. He was also dealing a little in high-school, and I'm pretty sure he still holds weed for others. Not sure if he's ever done harder drugs. He's had a few DWI's and been caught with possession a few times, he's also totaled a few cars when high or drunk. The judges pity him usually and just slap him with fines, drug classes, probation, and community service. But as soon as he'd pay his dues, he'd get busted again. Lately, my mom tells me, he hasn't been doing any of it at all; he has community service and classes he has to attend. She's afraid they'll throw him in jail. To me it feels like the judges feel sorry for him and don't want to put him in jail; we live in Cook County and jail wouldn't be good for a scrawny white guy.

He's essentially been living off my parents for years now, they've covered most of his legal fees while they could, bought him new cars, tried to find him a job. They've essentially given up, or can't afford to help him anymore. My dad hasn't talked to him in years, and the only reason he's still living with them is because my Mom is letting him. She's afraid he'll be homeless if she throws him out. He used to have good friend that helped him out and were reliable, most of them however have moved on with their lives. His only friends now are mostly younger than he is, druggies, drunks, and dealers. Most I feel keep him around for shits and giggles; just to take advantage of him (like holding drugs for them, driving them around in his car while dealing, etc.) and I don't think he understands it. Again, he's not bright at all...

He has a very difficult person to talk to/deal with. His lack of any intelligence is really his biggest downfall. It is impossible to reason with him or convince him of anything. His only opinions are his friends' opinions. He tends to simply repeat things other people say. His relationship with the rest of the family has been quite tense because of it. He never listens to advice or reasoning, conversations with him often turn into very heated arguments. Most of the time he acts as if we're all ganged up on him, against him, wish bad things unto him. He thinks we don't love him. Because conversations turn into arguments, I can see how he'd feel that way, but any sort of logical reasoning with him to explain that we're just trying to help doesn't seem to click. Telling him calmly that we do actually care about him and want him to succeed in life usually has no effect, might make him cry.

Worst yet, he tends to be very mean spirited and in arguments tends to say very mean things. He also takes advantage of my Mom and the fact that she doesn't want him leaving home. He uses that to extort money out of her. My dad would have had him out of the house quite a while ago, but again my Mom won't let it happen. She's been growing more apathetic toward him over the years, not enough to throw him out of the house though.

In the past when I did try to talk to him about his life and understand why he does things he does, it would yield no results. It wasn't until a few years ago, after paying his bail and picking him up from the police station that I was able to get a glimpse of what's inside. When prodding him to answers as to why he was doing all the things he was doing he told me that he's deeply unhappy and he doesn't think he can have anything he wants in life. He told me he's not good looking, not smart, never had a girlfriend and probably never will, no job, no money, nothing. He told me he smokes weed because he has nothing else to do and it relieves him of his unhappiness. 

My argument to him then was, that you have to play the cards that you're dealt. That if you want something in life that you have to work or it, work really hard. That if you're unhappy with who you are you have to work at changing it. He spent too much of his life simply quitting without trying, and I told him that. I told him that when you're faced with things that are hard and you don't understand, or you make mistakes, that you have to learn from it and try harder. I told him, then given where he was in his life, he'd have to start at the bottom and he'd have to work really hard, but he could be successful and happy. I told him that if he wanted his relationship with the rest of the family to improve that he'd have to change his way of life and try harder. I told him that the whole family would be behind him if he tried. 

Well it's been 2 years since then, nothing has improved, and now there's an increased risk of him going to jail. I'm at a loss as to what to do about him. I don't want to quit on him, and I know my whole family doesn't want to quit on him either. Can Mr. Reddit give me some advice on what I could do to help my brother?

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR at the bottom!!*

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my first semester of junior year in a city college. It's relatively low-cost compared to other colleges and I have no debt thus far because my mother is able to pay for it plus scholarship money I receive. I still rely on my family and live at home. I've been pretty aimless for my entire college experience. I have no clue about what I want to do with my life nor how to proceed other than drudging through the four years to my bachelors. I also have a history of depression and it's gotten a lot worst since I entered college. I developed full-blown social anxiety and I haven't been able to make any friends. I was incredibly lonely until I started volunteering/interning at a non-prof in the school for the past year, and it's the only reason my anxiety is better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a decent GPA but I'm a generally horrible student. I'm such a severe procrastinator that I'm in a constant state of stress and sleeplessness during the semester because of my lack of motivation. I'll just stay up all night not writing papers, then writing them or studying hours before their due date. This in itself is a problem I'm ashamed of because I should have grown out of it, but that's a different issue. It's both caused by and contributes to my depression (I assume).

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, this semester was especially bad. I overloaded myself with difficult classes and an internship and I completely burned out. I had to drop a major class I needed, and I gave in all my final papers late. I was so depressed over my personal performance, that my mom or my therapist first suggested that I could take a gap semester and work. As time went on, I decided that a break would be beneficial to my mental help, and my therapist thought so too. My mother was very supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

 For the past three semesters, I've been receiving a scholarship that pays for my tuition. It's conditional, so if I don't meet 30 credits a year, I lose it. It was my main reason for not wanting to take a gap semester. How do you just take a break knowing it will cost you thousands of unnecessary dollars? I think my mom saw how distraught I was and ensured me over and over that she wouldn't mind if I lost the money if it would be good for me. The only reason I started to seriously consider taking off was because she was so supportive. It's her money she's spending on my education. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was a few months ago. Since I've gone on break (3 weeks ago), I've been forced to seriously consider what I want to do and find work for the break. I don't want to defend myself, but I literally haven't thought much about it because once I got out of school, I went completely into rest mode. I'm extremely avoidant and procrastinate, so I put it off. Everyone is telling me to do different things (get a job/go back to school/ go part time and get an internship/ get a full-time internship) and I have no idea what to do. I feel like every choice I make will be a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this past week, I finally settled on taking 2 classes and finding an internship or work on the side, but even that is an undertaking. The thought of going back is scary. I hate school so much, and because of the way I am, it's made me miserable and isolated. I feel like I can barely function in class, and I can't do well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So today, I finally tell my mom what I think I'm going to do during my gap, and she asks me (again, I've told her multiple times) what happens if I take a gap. I reiterated that I'd lose the scholarship and couldn't reapply. I think this made her nervous combined with my previous aimlessness. Against what she previously told me, she gently asks me if I want to just go back to class and take a gap later so I'll get another semester of paid tuition. She told me again that it was my choice, but asked me again if I really didn't want to go back. I didn't say anything, and she said that it felt like a waste to  lose free money and I'd sit at home depressed and jobless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Obviously, my mom is justified in doing this. It's free money and she has to pay for tuition. But I did consider this. Actually, the only reason I didn't want to take a gap was *because* of the money, and I only decided to because of how many times she told me it was okay. It's been at least 2+ months. Now, 2 weeks before class, she's suddenly asking me if I want to go back and stick it out. It changes everything. I can't justify taking a gap knowing that she prefers I go back to class. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's just that I spent a long time thinking about this. I don't even have my classes prepared for full-time because I wasn't going back. And while she still says it's my choice, she has to know that it no longer is. Obviously her rationale is valid (and a little faithless). Why would she tell me so many times that it was fine if it wasn't, and wait until I'm ready to leave to tell me otherwise? Thinking of going back full time is freaking me out. I feel so sick. I will if I have to but I don't want to. I don't know what to do. I don't think my mental health is important enough to make her pay thousands of dollars if I can manage, but all the same, my head is really spinning now that my plans might be in the trash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her idea of delaying taking a gap is also useless to me. After the upcoming semester, I would only need to stay for 1-2 more semesters to finish my degree, so I wouldn't even bother taking a break at that point. I wanted to leave after this semester because of my poor performance and depression. So if I go back, I'd be in it for the long haul.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be I'm not thinking rationally. I don't even know if anyone will read this. I would just like someone to tell me what they think, and any advice they may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Tldr; I get a scholarship that pays for my tuition. I'm supported by my mom. Because of worsening mental health and confusion over career path, my mom encouraged me to take a gap year 2+ months ago. I would lose the scholarship and can't reapply, but she reassured me mult. times that she supports my choice b/c the tuition is low cost. I started planning for my gap and was set on it. Today, 2 weeks before class, mom asks me to go back full time. Stressed and don't know what to do. It's her money, but my head.*",college,Should I take a gap year for mental health if I will lose scholarship money?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/afh9xn/should_i_take_a_gap_year_for_mental_health_if_i/,1547387683.0,can't pay for school,8.286666666666667

My boyfriend and I (23/21) have been struggling for over a year now, having to move 6+ times (his parents kept 'helping' us (young with no credit) and it kept ending up putting us in bad situations because we had no say), I've had 4+ jobs, including one that I moved to a different city for and after they wrongfully terminated me (have a case open with the EEOC), I have yet to find a job that is worth a crap/isn't screwing me over. We have sold everything we own (that's worth anything) and everyday isanother battle with waiting for a craigslist email to see if we will eat that day. After selling our cell phones in November for food/gas money, he surprised me with one last week because the job I had had a broken phone, so I had no way in getting in contact with anyone once at work, including the police (it was a convenience store). The computer we have was bought by his mom with credit that I have been trying to pay off as well. The computer and now cell phone is more valuable to us that any of our other possessions (clothes, unsellable furniture, other crap in boxes marked 'garage sale' (we have 4 garage sales a month, when possible (this town has a place set aside for garage sales)). I now have an ebay account again and have been trying that avenue. The start of this downhill battle was my boyfriend's disabling medical issues that have gotten so severe, he can't leave the house sometimes. He has applied for disability twice on his own and now we have a lawyer who says she thinks she can make it happen (as soon as they see someone under 25 years old applying, apparently it's almost impossible). His (physical) medical problems get worse under stress (significantly) and now that we have moved out of the 'perfect little house' we had because the landlord was committing fraud/overstepping his boundaries, we have to live with his parents (which is the worst thing for him and his health) until we have enough money to go somewhere. I moved out asap and now 3 years later I'm living with someone else's parents.

I have no family that I have anything to do with (and for good reason) and if they were around they wouldn't/couldn't help. I moved out at 18 and finished high school online, working a full time job with only my bicycle. Several obstacles/fucked up relationships later, I'm in the best relationship ever and we can't afford to eat/have nowhere to go. We have no friends (no one wants to hang out with you at your empty apartment and star at the walls/help you figure out how to make money for that day) and I've recently confessed to my boyfriend that I feel I have started suffering from a mental disorder that I have no control over and am scared to death of hurting our amazing relationship. I've thought about exploiting the fact that I weigh near nothing now and have the 'desired model body' to see if I can make any money that way, but the risks involved with 'modeling' and the fact that I won't do anything nude (not thought out and not artistic) for some dude off craigslist. prevents that from being worth looking into. But I now have the 'make money off your looks' option open, but within reason and respect for my boyfriend. 

We have weighed several options in the past year:

* Trucking (2 people can share a cab, drive across the country and be making money while having a 'home base' (truck). 
Living in a white panel van: he mentioned this the other day and asked what we would need to convert it to as living friendly as possible.

* Small basic RV: Large start-up cost, but wouldn't mind this idea. I'm very familiar to camping and have stayed in campers and RV's recreationally, in the past. But this would also be our vehicle, so when I would go to work, my house would be coming with me (unknown to everyone else in the parking lot, but it's kinda weird)

* Buying a really crappy trailer and sticking it on his parents land somewhere. Also gotta figure out how to turn a random spot of land into an RV-like full hook-up spot.
Driving a motorcycle across the country and figuring it out as we go, trying to start somewhere new. This is one we thought long and hard about last year. But it obviously has the most risks. 

We have nothing keeping us here. And have nowhere to go but up.

To make matter worse/more fuck up, I received a phone call from the old HR manager at the company I have an claim against and she tells me that they are about to write me a 100k+ check because my claim was correct. I have been blowing my case worker's phone up and every other number I can get for the past 2 weeks and NO ONE will call me back/answer their phones. I don't think my case worker knows a lot of what I was told, and she probably doesn't think this case will go anywhere. The HR manager initially told this to my boyfriend's mom (works for the same company and are friends) and now all his mom does is ""have you called anyone yet?"" ""I really hope you'd call someone and get something done"" even before I ever had spoken to the old HR manager for her to tell me that opening a case did something. So knowing that I'm seen as the 'will receive a check and take all the stress away from him and his family' person, I am not comfortable here and am tired of that 'imaginary check' being relied upon. If it comes it comes. But right now, we need a home away from this stress. 

Sorry about all the random details/story telling. It's hard to explain a year+ of everyday struggling to the internet. I have tried asking reddit for advice on multiple occasions and usually end up regretting it or getting no responses, which sucks when you have no one else to ask for help. I'm looking for suggestions. Avenue's we haven't thought of/are not aware of. We are very intelligent, I am physically capable and when his issues aren't bad, he doesn't care and will push through any manual labor and deal with the repercussions later (within reason). I have a hard time believing we have tried everything/have run out of options. 

**TL;DR With no money and help from family/friends we have run out of options of surviving and need suggestions/advice on what to do and where to go. We are not above anything (except for illegal activities).**

[deleted],1348111162,/r/AskReddit/comments/1069yg/just_offer_some_advice_maybe/,"I write this post tonight, like I would write a letter to a dear ol' friend. Just a letter packed full of memories, dreams, wishes, and even those bad things no one likes to mention. Just a letter with how my life is going, and my thoughts on it so far. So to say.
I don't know what people will say with their personal responses to this, but I do know, that by the time I have finished this letter (post), I will go smoke a cigarette, and then truck on off to bed. 

Now, I didn't have a life no worse than other people do, but I didn't have one that was any better. From a very young age, I had already seen enough to know that life was going to present it's trials and tribulations. I was fine with that, I expected it, however I was not prepared for it. 
It was one thing to grow up the way I did, and to deal with it. It was a WHOLE new fucking ball game, to see that this was still going to last this way for my mother. 

I started out, like all children, as a complete imbecile, thinking my bad young self knew all the answers, and my shit smelled like roses. Which, you know they did, roses stink, and my dung stank like a crack house baking cow patties. (That sentence is completely out of wack but moving on.)
As the years would go on, I would start to become arrogant, foolish, obnoxious, and just a dumb black bitch. That's right, I said it. I acted like I was hot shit, and like everyone was against me because of ""racial discrimination"". Yet, as time went on, I started to notice, it wasn't because of my skin that no one respected me, or treated me nicely. No, it was because, I was a dumb hood rat who didn't treat herself, with respect, or even love herself. No one cared what color I was. They cared about how I presented myself. How I treated them. Along with a few other things. It was then at 9, I met my father, Alex, a white country man. Talk about a major news flash.

Now I include races, because I grew up in a very racist family, my mother's side, who were all colored. My father, was a very very wide awakening in my life. In meeting my father, a man who held a job, who didn't have to constantly move, and always had food, hot water, and electricity, I started to put two and two together. 
Instead of acting like those in my family, living a life on welfare, and never having anything. Never affording clothes for your kids, and school supplies, food, and the basic necessities. I could follow in my fathers foot steps and act like him. I could go to school, work hard, and gain many things, and have all those basic things, like food, shelter, and water. Needless to say. That is exactly what I did. 

I graduated valedictorian at 16, and went on to my first job. Nothing that fancy or great. But I was happy.

Now to present day, the reason I started writing this, was because I thought of my mother and the things she told me on the 16th of September 2012. 

All my life, I had only one wish, that was to always be able to take care of my mama. My mother raised, 4 girls on her own, working 2 jobs for minimum wage. Then in 2004, my mother had a bad accident at her nursing job, and broke 4 discs in her back. The doctor told my mother that she had the choice of removing them, but the stakes were very high. She could come out paralyzed, a vegetable, dead, or okay. My mother declined. The reason those stakes were so high, is because my mother has 2 of those 4 discs, located on a main artery. It is making her lose use of the left side of her body. The doctor predicted that my mother should be fully paralyzed on her left side by 48, she is 46 now, and it's almost complete.

All I have ever wanted, was to be able to take care of her. To not have to see my mother in constant pain. She can't afford to have her teeth fixed from her ex husband beating them out of her, nor to go to a doctor for the medication for her body. Every day I see my mother struggling to get up from bed. She usually ends up crying out in pain. Then she will stand up finally with my help, and waddle for the rest of the day because she can't use her left leg. Not only does all this go on, but I watch her break down in tears from her body dying on her as she tries to walk, or do basic activities. She can not even hold down a job from all of this. 
At night, i have to line pillows at her back, and her legs, just a lot of things to try and make her at least a little bit comfortable in her bed so that she can have a decent sleep. My mother is my hero, she is the woman I love with all my heart. She has always been there for me. Always stayed by my side and only ever wanted to be able to live in peace in a beautiful mobile home. 

Yet, this will not come to pass. Her mother, her own flesh and blood, pulled shit on my mother. In 2006, we were taken from our home because of a lie my sister told on my parents which resulted in them loosing custody of all four of us. My grandmother, Mary, my mother's mom, gained custody over us. I was released first, back into my parents hands at 16, and then my sister Tosha will be released on October 1st at 18. 
What my mother told me that day, was that she is going to go to jail for 1 to 5 years because she was not able to pay child support that her mother took out against her, 7 months ago. Which is now at a whopping 4 grand.(NOTE that my mother paid 1800 to them)  On top of this, she tells me my fathers company Virginia Fire and Safety, is shutting it's doors in 3 weeks, and that they owe 3 more fucking grand on our house. 

Now please do tell me, how they can expect a woman who can fucking move, to work? How do they expect her to keep her house? How the fuck can people treat their own family like this? 

I'm not asking for money, I'm just asking for advice from people on what I could possibly do to help my mother stay out of jail, and how I can save their house. They just rent it, not own it. 

All I wanted in this life guys, was to be able to provide my mother a stable home. She has had so much hell raising all of us, and trying her hardest. I just really need some advice. I don't need spam, or hate comments. Just something that can tell me what I might be able to do to help her.

[deleted],1339982521,/r/AskReddit/comments/v7ama/have_you_ever_been_positive_a_teacher_really/,"When I was in the fourth grade, I had a teacher that, now looking back on it, I'm pretty sure disliked me greatly. I was a pretty good kid, albeit a bit quiet in class discussion and if I was with my friends I would talk some (but seriously, what kid didn't). But the thing is, I had that teacher for one class section of the day, and the rest of my classes I went across the hall. 


My elementary school had this 'time-out' time (called something else), and you basically went across the hall to the other room to fill out a form on what you did wrong, and how you'll change your behaviors, etc. I got sent to 'time-out' 50-some times in that year ALONE. Only 2 of those times were from the teacher whose classroom I spent most of the day in. The rest were from my homeroom teacher. Now, if I had like a record of having bunches of 'time-outs', I wouldn't be complaining. But I didn't. I had 3 the previous year, and 1 the year following my fourth grade year. The first time she sent me, was the first day. There was this kid who wouldn't shut-up, and I told him to be quiet. He said make me, and I said 'maybe I will'. And honestly, this kid was probably the most annoying little shit you've ever met. I was thinking the fourth grader version of this on the first day I met him. And I was a pretty nice and quiet kid. This little shit walks up to my homeroom teacher and says ""She said that if I didn't shut-up, she'd shove her fist down my throat."" I remind you, this is the first day, so the teacher doesn't know me, doesn't know how I act, etc. But she believed him and sent me anyways. 


It kind of went off from there. I was sent 2-3 times a week, and I remember if you were sent more than 3 times, you went to the principle. I worked so hard not to be sent more than three times. Plus, it was hard for her to send me so much, because I only had one class with her. But the days she didn't send me out, she made examples of me, scolded me for random things (such as 'smelling bad'. I had pretty good hygiene, so I don't even know), and finding reasons to exclude me from fun activities. Such as the health day, when she made me sit out in the hall for 'being impatient on making a snack' (I asked my friend when we were going to make them). One thing I remember vividly, is that she gave out candy to everyone. We were in a weird building set-up, so she even threw them over the fucking wall. But did I ever get one? No. Not even once. She even went as far as to yell at my friend who offered to share her candy with me. She was also friends with this lady who chaperoned the kids to lunch and back, and I remember this lady seemed to dislike me too. We were assigned numbers each lunch hour and 1 went first in line and 50 went last. I always got high numbers, and one of the only times I got a one, the teacher saw me up front and declared it was opposite number day (no joke) and I had to go to the back of the line. 


But sometimes, my teacher stepped wayyyy over the line. It's one thing to not be a favorite, but it's another to berate a kid down to their family. Me and my friend got in a scuffle because she thought my parents were alcoholics because she came over once and they were drinking a glass of wine (her parents never drank). I started crying and I got pulled out into the hall with my friend. She made us discuss it and apologize, and all the time I was insisting my parents weren't alcoholics, and she was just kinda like 'uh huh, uh huh'. But then she went as far to contact my mom and inform her about it, and basically went as far as to hint at there may be a problem, or that my parents were alcoholics. With the lunch lady I mentioned earlier, the second (and last) time I got a one for the lunch line, it was a windy day, and on the way up the note with the number on it slipped out of my hand and into the sewer. The lady acted mad, and then said ""maybe we should hang you by your ankles and have you grab it down there with all the raccoons"". Just little shit like this happened way too often. I know most of the stuff I mentioned before was just stuff that matters to a 4th grader and kind of bummed me out, but these two examples stick out of my mind as being really unprofessional. 


When I finally got out of that hellhole of a class (getting not one but 2 'time-outs' on the last day) I was relieved. But I was just a little ways from being done with that teacher. The last incident was in the fifth grade, when I brought a bit of my rock collection to science upon science teachers request (I was a bit of a nerd). I brought this semi-expensive 'starter collection' thing that you can get from a catalog that I had gotten for Christmas. On the way up the stairs to my class, it got knocked out of my hands by accident and spilled all over the floor shattering some of the rocks. I start freaking out because there is a small piece of lead in this collection and I'm convinced I'm going to poison everyone, and I'm sniffling. Whatever, teachers assure me it's no big deal, and they help me clean it up. I'm bummed because I broke this collection thing I got for Christmas. Then, my old fourth grade teacher comes up, and she's wondering what's going on. I told her, whilst sniffling, that my rock collection I brought for science broke. She kinda rolled her eyes at me and says, ""it's fine"" all exasperated. 
Later that day I go into the nurse because my arm hurt and I was dizzy (I had fallen during recess, that's why my arm hurt) and I was laying down. My old teacher walks in for her medication or something, and she sees me, and asks the nurse why I'm here. She tells her what I came in for, and my old teacher leans in and whisper-talks (while I'm laying down maybe 6 feet away), telling her that it's because I ""dropped my rocks."" Insinuating that I was playing hooky or something. Ugh, it just makes me angry just typing about it. Soon, I was out of elementary school. I was, needless to say, very thankful.

TL;DR: 4th grade teacher sends me to 'time-out' 50-some times in a year, when the rest of my record is at most 3 in a year. Insinuates my parents are alcoholics and that I was some no good kid. Continues to spread her dislike of me even when I'm no longer in her class.

GaminW,1637480034,/r/college/comments/qypw1t/should_i_stick_with_my_cs_major/," 

Hey, I'm a typical college student who's having trouble with deciding their major. Been in college for like 2 and a half years already and went from a criminal justice major to a psychology and now a computer science major. I'm about to hit you with a long ass story so maybe go grab a snack or somethin idk

Like a year back your boy got cheated on for the first time, it was his first relationship too so that ruined me. During that time my home girl lets say Emily helped me go through that tough time. I knew her for 7.5 years, we've been online friends for a long time and have been playing video games throughout those years very often. We got super close ever since my ex cheated on me, we then started dating. Everything was going great, I switched majors to computer science and started my prerequisite classes during the summer, I was doing fine (B- in discrete math and C- in calc 1). Me and Emily planned on meeting for the first time towards the end of October. This is where everything goes downhill, Emily cheats on me hell yeaaa this is awesome (not really). Your boy was heart broken, exams were also near, I took a massive L on my linear algebra calc 2 and intro c++ exams. I was able to complete my english essay though so that's good (taking a intensive english writing class as well). Imagine dating your best friend of 6 years for a year and a half and then have them cheat on you when you two were literally about to meet in a couple of weeks haha. Yea your boy went through the great depression. It also sucked that I had no one to talk to about it so yea I bottled it all up and I still do which probably isn't healthy. I now lack the beginning/mid information of these courses, I am NOT an math expert so catching up has been extremely hard for me, like honestly I don't think I'm catching up at all it's like I'm taking in information and spitting it back out for another piece of information. Been struggling to focus on lectures as well. I have a linear and cs exam on Tuesday which I am NOT prepared for, I'm looking at my cs/linear practice exam and oh god I can't solve any of the questions. I know I'm going to fail these two exams.

Now the big question is whether or not computer science is for me. Around the early stages of the class I really did enjoy it, it felt nice when my code worked and I did kind of liked the puzzles here and there. As the course progressed things obviously started to get harder which is normal for every college course. Its frustrating when I don't understand what's happening, I'll be trying to google up parts of the question to have myself google up a part of the googled answer, it's very frustrating. I'm not sure if it was because of the girlfriend incident that's making me want to change majors, I don't really like pure math at all but the concept of coding is really interesting to me, I do find myself enjoying it sometimes and I do feel really cool doing it haha. Obviously the incident hindered me and ruined my learning experience in CS, I'm not sure whether it is me as person not enjoying the class or if it was her that made me not enjoy the class. I don't really know how to explain it, basically I went from variables loops stuffs like that and then hopped backed in at recursions and arrays, its all very confusing right now. Maybe it was a bad idea to take 2 math class and intensive writing class on the side? (probably was, especially when im not a math talented student). Honestly I don't even know if I make sense right now, I probably sound hella dumb trying to explain my entire situation. Over the years of taking career quizzes and personality exams they all recommend me trying computer science but like I don't really enjoy it I think? Am I suppose to look forward to this class every single day? Like am I suppose to be excited to wake up at 9 am (big mistake taking it at 9 am btw im not a morning person) in the morning for this CS class? It's like I enjoy it but I don't enjoy it, my brain is so conflicted I don't know how to explain it. How do I know if it's something I'd want to do for the rest of my life? One thing I do know is that I really do want to do something tech related. I really enjoy being near computers and doing computer related activities, it's one thing that I learned about myself when taking this CS class. I was looking at maybe IT but I really don't want to transfer college again. Should I retake the course alone next semester and see how it goes? Or should I just change majors into something else, I was looking at accounting business or graphic design. I heard the math in accounting isn't that bad, I'm fine with doing basic algebra I just really hate the complex math questions where you gotta use like 500 formulas on one question that has an part a to z in it. I'm worried about what to do next but I don't really want to delay my graduation anymore, I already delayed it by a year when I switched my major, I don't want to delay it even more. I have nothing against people who graduated late, I don't know why I get this feeling but I just have this random fear of graduating late, not sure why. Another thing is I feel so bad and guilty for wasting my dad's money. He's paying for my tuition, he didn't even want to pay for it in the beginning but my mom convinced him to do it. What am I suppose to tell him if I fail this class (which I probably will, I got a 6/40 on my first CS exam yeaa I didn't do good, 45/100 linear exam and 28/100 calc 2). I'm pretty much lost right now with what I want to do with my life, this post is probably really dumb but I just wanted to put it out there and see what your thoughts are. If I said anything confusing go ahead and ask a question, I wrote this on my phone past midnight while I was crying myself to sleep so there will probably be some confusing sentences here and there. Your mentally broken home boy is extremely confused with everything and needs some guidance.

I'm a 20 year old dude enrolling in a CUNY college btw if you were curious.

Oh btw If I do pass linear algebra and calc 2 with a c- the only math class I'll have left will be probability, I was able to complete discrete math, pre calc, and calc 1. I'm just unsure whether I actually enjoy coding or not.

Was gonna post this in a cs subreddit but I do wanna see what everyone else has to say about this.

Leopars56,1606871922,/r/college/comments/k4yxeh/this_semester_grades_handling_of_covid_effects_on/,"So I'm currently a sophomore attending a very rigorous, top 25 US university. Basically, I had found myself going down a dark path when COVID/Lockdowns first started. As I am sure it did to most, being in a lockdown/isolated from the normal life that we have all grown accustomed to really had a negative impact on my mental health. My family has a history of depression on both sides and I could not admit it to myself at the time, but I was becoming depressed. I started smoking weed everyday, multiple times per day and stayed in bed constantly. I would just smoke, go on my laptop, xbox, or phone and numb myself from the feelings I was experiencing.

Once the lockdown started to ease up in the summer, I was 20 pounds heavier (in 2 months) and disgusted with myself whenever I was sober and looked in the mirror. Without any motivation, I continued my way down this dark spiraling path.  I kept telling myself it would get better once I returned to college, but I got myself into more bad habits in the mean time. My ""friend"" became an  illegal ""online bookie"" and I would spend my days just gambling and smoking. My concept of realness would get so numbed from the constant high, that I would be irrational with my gambling and not have any concept of how much I was actually losing (these sites use credits, so there are no up front deposits needed. Just a final payout/collection at the end of the week.). This newfound gambling addiction was a way for me to create excitement in a time I felt there was not much to do.

Luckily for me my college did decide to open up in the fall, and I felt some non drug/gambling related excitement for the first time in awhile. I had just finished pledging a fraternity before COVID had impacted that semester, and could not wait to see my friends. Part of me had no confidence in some regards, as my subtle transformation to a degenerate left me feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin. I dealt with this for the beginning of the semester when I got back, but then something cool happened. I started to find motivation. I was able to workout with friends in our dorms which made it a lot more fun and we were able to hold each other accountable, and they helped me go on a t break. I had lost 10 pounds and was feeling the best I had in a long time.

But then I got Covid. I hadn't gone to a single party. We hungout in our dorms and kept low, but everyone on campus was seemingly getting it. The school threw me in a Best Western Motel for 12 days and I completely regressed back to my old ways. All I had for the next 12 days was weed I had brought (Even with the tbreak there was no way at that time I was going to get through 12 days of isolation with no weed at all. Call it dumb, but other people brought alcohol to keep them company, so to each their own) and the TV in my room. As well as the gambling that I decided to take up again, which resulted in me risking a total of $700 in those 12 days and pretty much breaking even at -$12. I was not allowed to go outside once. I had entered into that Best Western  when it was around 75-80 degrees in the beginning of October, to 60-65 when I came out, but I didnt realize the gradual shift in temperature til the day I left. 

The isolation and experience of that was horrible. I didnt have any symptoms of Covid besides a slight fever and loss of smell which I regained after a few days. These slight symptoms goes for any college student I have personally met that has contracted the disease, which is around 75-100.  The symptoms of Covid werent the bad part for me, it was the complete tear of my mental health. I came out of that isolation in the same position I had started in before college started: Depressed, addicted to pot and gambling, and overweight. 

The campus I returned to was the most restrictive place I could ever imagine. I got written up for throwing a football on the quad, and being in a 4 person hall when there were 5 people there at the time within the first few weeks. There was nothing to do and I felt completely lost about how I could turn my life around. 

This had such a huge toll on me and my habits got worse and worse. I started smoking the most I had ever in my entire life. I would wake up and get high and immediately start placing bets. I had met some guys who were big spenders and I would start to match their spending habits while I was completely fried and not involved in the reality of it all. I knew it was really getting bad when I had to call my parents for $1.3k out of my savings account. I admitted my issues gambling and they told me to get help from someone at school, but wired me the money too. I had thought that by calling them they would take me out of this place and tell me to come home. A few weeks later I was feeling so shit that I was throwing down the most expensive bets ever cause in the back of my head it was ""well, you're either gonna be making some nice money or definitely going home this time"". Obviously that was foolish and dumb, but thats the way Ive looked back and assessed my thought process during that time and my therapist agrees. 

Upon coming home, my family had been supportive and I have never felt better. Hitting a personal rock bottom has shifted my perspective on life and I can gladly say I have been seeing a therapist for the first time in my life these past 6 weeks I have been home, and I also have not bet or smoked once. I am happy to say that I also have been going to the gym 6 times a week, and have never been in better shape before. 

With this all being said (sorry for such a long post XD), how do these schools expect us students to be okay in the conditions they have set up for us? I know I am not the only one who has experienced these sort of things this semester, yet might be one of the only ones to admit these problems I have dealt with. Although I am doing great now, I really feel this whole situation is fucked and that these schools should be exposed for the non-caring businesses they truthfully are. They only care about the money we pay them regardless of the experience they provide, and for me thats 38k (76k a year!) for a 2.6 GPA (haven't even told my parents yet), deepened mental health issues, and unneeded stress. 

I guess I wanted this to be more of a place for people to share their opinions on the COVID effected semester and share their own experiences.

djnotpocket,1611760721,/r/socialwork/comments/l66luw/asus_msw_program_grad_do_not_do_asu_msw_online/,"Hey everyone,

This is post is from about two years after I graduated, and things have worked out for me in the long run, as I am an LMSW working at a private practice. But for a long time, I've wanted to write a post in the event that someone is considering ASU's online MSW program, and I wanted to give an honest assessment. First, to get the good out of the way, my goal was to take classes very part-time (1 or 2 at a time) and graduate in 4 years while working full time. My plan was to take a block internship in the summer prior to graduating and then work part-time while doing my advanced level internship. So in the end, I have gotten into the field I want to be in and everything worked out. Distance learning allowed me to live in 3 different locations while completing my studies, so the flexibility was great. If I were to do it again, I'd prefer to do classes in person or synchronous learning so I actually interact with professors and classmates and ask questions. I lived overseas in my first year, so the asyncronsity was helpful, but in the end, that meant that I basically learned everything on my own- Which, like I mentioned, in that sense, was what I signed up for. But the convenience of doing things on my own time required much more effort in self-organization, self-discipline, and learning things on my own.  That's a trade-off, not a hit on ASU specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bad: Ok, here's what I'd really like to emphasize- if you are considering  ASU's online program and do not live in the state, I think it is a very bad idea. The price is low relative to many other programs, but you will get close to ZERO, I MEAN ZERO HELP IN OBTAINING AN INTERNSHIP. if you go to an in-person school they will basically do almost all of the work to help you get an internship, they will probably already have a large network of places you can choose from, or if you are interested in interning at a place they don't already have a relationship with, you can go into their offices and work it out. But my experience with ASU was that despite submitting all the paperwork and trying to dot all my i's and crossing t's, ASU did not alert me regarding any problem at all- until I showed up for my first day of the internship and THEN they told me- hey, we haven't figured out this contract, and there is a disagreement about liability issues. Mind you, I quit my job in order to do an unpaid internship, so this was extremely upsetting. I worked tirelessly, calling every single day for close to 3 weeks to get these things taken care of, but i was basically shuffled around between departments. The primary office that  dealt with field placements almost literally told me to fuck off and to stop contacting them. I was in a desperate situation, as I was on a very tight timeline between quitting my job, starting and ending this internship, and moving across the country, as well as the fact that I already had my second internship set up- so if the 1st fell through, the whole house of cards would fall. So after several torturous weeks at home, only from the grace of god and a generous LCSW at a different organization who was willing to save my life, was I able to get a different internship- this was all with ZERO help from ASU. and the most frustrating thing about this was PAYING ASU $3000+ to do this internship when they made very clear they gave zero fucks about my situation. I get not being paid as an intern since the nonprofit invested time into me and helped me out, but it is incomprehensible how and why I paid ASU for this.

Come my second internship, since they required an LCSW to supervise me, and the supervisor I had at my next internship did not have one on site (LMHC and psychologist on staff), I arranged for one over state lines to supervise me and supervise me weekly. I knew this could be an issue so I made it very explicit to ASU what was going on, and provided all documentation that said otherwise. ASU seemed to be fine with it until THREE DAYS BEFORE MY INTERNSHIP STARTED. That is when they contacted me telling me they were going to revoke the ability to do this next internship unless the nonprofit I was interning for came up with a new LCSW to supervise me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, ASU made the process extremely difficult, put all the burden on me despite me paying them to do these internships for some reason?, and seemed to have little sympathy for these challenges. Maybe this is true at other distance learning schools, but this school did not provide much support in any way regarding field placement. So my general advice would be to give yourself about 8 months to confirm every aspect that the internship is all good to go, perhaps don't do a distance program that requires local connections, and have great distrust for the field placement team at ASU. I'm not so bitter about it anymore as things have really worked out for me, by luck and my own sweat/blood/tears. But I really want to warn future ASU MSW distance learning students, or those considering the program, that you really can't rely on ASU to help you lock in internships, you really need to do it all yourself, give yourself plenty of time to do so, and you will have to pay the school for your internships for seemlingly no reason (that last part might just be universal, pay-to-play sort of thing for getting a higher education- but if you just factor that in to the total cost, perhaps getting the master's will grant you entrance to a higher earning bracket throughout your life, so maybe we all shouldn't get too bogged down on it- but I can tell you in the moment it felt infuriating to write checks for $3000+ each internship, so really $6,000+ for ASU to give zero fucks about you. It might just be too big a program for them to be able to care in any way about you finding an internship.) Lastly, if I were to do it all again, I'd pick a clinical program instead of a generalist, but that's not a hit on ASU, that's just a general preference- in the end though, I'm ding what I want anyways. Please PM me with specific questions.  

 

TL;DR Do not expect much help at all from ASU MSW field placement team if you don't live in Arizona. Give yourself 8+ months to do all the leg work yourself and bother ASU far before the internship is supposed to start to confirm everything is good to go. They won't communicate with you about problems unless you reach out- or they'll alert you to issues when it is almost too late to do anything about it. My advice- if you do online learning, still pick a local program so you can go into the offices with any issues, particularly pertaining to distance learning.",socialwork,ASU's MSW Program Grad- Do Not do ASU MSW Online Program,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/l66luw/asus_msw_program_grad_do_not_do_asu_msw_online/,1611782321.0,can't pay for school,8.166666666666666
blahhhhh90,1582812892,/r/college/comments/faco8e/to_the_people_who_dont_want_to_go_to_their/,"I live in S. Korea. I moved away from my home, to another country, and took a different life path than the norm. I was previously a college drop out and i felt stuck and helpless. I spent one year in language school learning Korean, and saw the opportunity to study and get my degree at a well-known insitution (of the top 3 in the country) for MUCH cheaper tuition cost than in the USA as an opportunity. I worked my ass off, adjusted to a completely different educational system, took half my classes in my 2nd language. I visited home **twice** over the past 7 years that I have lived here. Every summer and winter vacation I could have taken extra classes to graduate sooner, but I couldn't because i needed the time to take on extra part-time work to earn my tuition and living expenses. It was hard but I survived it. I experienced a serious sexual assault case on the eve of my birthday by a complete stranger as I was going home from work, spent half the day in the police station and the other half packing my stuff because my male flatmate and so-called friend decided that being raped meant i was no longer a trustworthy housemate. I spent time homeless. I endured abuse and manipulation from messed up relationships with narcissists and fuckboys. 

I failed my first semester because i got pneumonia during finals while trying to work a bartending job 5 days a week. A year later I almost died of a heart infection triggered by what later came to be found as a diagnosis for an autoimmune disorder. I joined my school's women's soccer team, which i liked and found a way to make some new friends and have some sense of a social life and be able to do something that felt part of my identity. I got into health and fitness and started taking better care of my body, stopped working unhealthy jobs where i was badly mistreated as a foreigner and as a female, even if the pay was less. Then I tore my ACL and had to have surgery, and was out of sport and the gym for several months. I dove into my studies and said ""fuck you"" to everyone around me, I cut out my social life (which was already not much to begin with) but I blasted through my courses and kept my GPA up and my bills paid. Eventually I got into a routine and was able to start being social again and I met some of the best friends I thought I could have, and my current boyfriend who i've been together with for over a year. He's as asshole sometimes and nobody is perfect but he definitely loves and respects me. I got closer to God, and found new peace in faith. It took me 11 semesters (5.5 years) but i finally finished all my credits and I was set up to graduate this week. (our academic year starts in March) I finished a dual degree and a minor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then because of the coronavirus and increasing tensions regarding the situation, our school cancelled the graduation ceremony. Then they cancelled the opportunity to rent the gowns and at least take pictures on campus. 

I went in today to pick up my diploma. The lady in the office just handed me two pieces of card stock and gestured to a table for the hard cover book and told me i can take one to put my certificates inside. Then I went outside, and for some reason, people were all over campus with their friends and families, dressed up nice, taking pictures, wearing the gowns, getting flowers, happy and excited. Despite all the chaos and stress with this virus situation. Yet there I was, not even showered, with bloody gauze in my mouth (i had dental surgery earlier that morning), alone, with this stupid book in my hands. I felt angry and bitter. My family can't fly out here to celebrate with me. None of my friends remembered, and I couldn't invite them out for photos and stuff since the event was supposed to be cancelled. With the virus, and people usually busy with their lives and other things on the weekends, I didn't bother to plan a graduation party because I already knew that half of the people I really wanted to be there wouldn't come. My boyfriend didn't even call or text me today to congratulate me. Instead, I have endured waiting for him to tell me about how much stress and pressure he has been under because his parents are splitting - i know about it, but not the details, but after over a year he still hasn't said a word to me about it. So whatever happened today put him in a bad mood and all he could say to me today was ""leave me alone."" Wow, babe, thanks. I couldn't even get a ""Congratulations babe, i'm so proud of you, listen i'm sorry things are not good for me right now, but i love you and let's celebrate later. "" I know that if I hadn't posted a picture of my diploma on social media not a single person would have remembered to say anything to me, and even then, i get a bunch of comments on IG and Facebook but no personal messages, no phone calls. Nothing. Because of time zone differences I can't even call my family and talk to them. 

I paid for this out of my pocket. I uprooted my life, and suffered through so much, I'm about to be 30 this year and I'm finally a college graduate. Yet this most important milestone, that's supposed to be a most important day full of happiness and celebration, I spent the entire day alone in my apartment crying all day long without anyone giving a single shit, eating soggy spaghetti because of stupid stitches in my mouth. With all of that, it's impossible to feel happy for myself. Spending so many years in chronic anxiety and stress just pushing and pushing all for this day, and nothing comes. Yes I'm grateful for the opportunity to even go to school and graduate at all, i'm grateful that i'm not sick with coronavirus and i'm healthy and i have my home to live in. I'm grateful for the people who did support me and stuck around when i went through dark times, and made the less-dark times more light and enjoyable memories. But TODAY, no one was there for me. Nobody. And i didn't even have a cheesy boring ceremony to at least make it somewhat special and give me the acknowledgment I fucking earned for my achievement.

So all of you people who don't want to go to your commencement, who think graduation is stupid and a waste of time, *fuck you*. You should appreciate the opportunity you have to have such a thing. Even if your parents or family isn't supportive, even if your GPA wasn't that great, you have your friends and classmates and the atmosphere. you have photos to look back on as proof and reminders of that amazing thing you achieved. You at least have the choice.",college,"To the people who don't want to go to their graduation and think it's stupid, I hate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/faco8e/to_the_people_who_dont_want_to_go_to_their/,1582834492.0,can't pay for school,8.093333333333334
waterlilly3,1313535778,/r/AskReddit/comments/jkzak/engineers_doctors_and_people_with_advice_how_to/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm new to this and my problem is very complicated/long-winded so be warned. Hell, I don’t even know if I’m posting in the right sub-reddit. However, if you manage to sift through the self-involved sludge I'm about to unload and you have some, any, insight or advice, please please let me know because I'm lost and scared.

Here goes:

I’m going into my second year of college. I’m from a traditional Asian family who mean the world to me. My family has been through a lot and has sacrificed a lot for me and I owe them everything. They are pushing me to do pre-med but I’m having a harder and harder time going along with it and I’m finding myself pushing back. I don’t know if it’s because I deep down I know pre-med isn’t right for me (which it very well could be) or simply because I’m being an unappreciative child who wants to rebel and explore before signing my life to single career. I’d like to think I’m more mature than that, but it’s still a possibility.

I’m at a crossroads between choosing engineering or pre-med. 

Pre-med: If I do pre-med, I want to do it for me, not for my family because in the end, I will not survive or be successful if my heart isn’t in it. I think that during med school interviews, when they ask probing questions about my motivations, they’ll know if I don’t have a passion for it. Yet my skill set lies in pre-med things (years of lab work, science background, my sibling recently graduated MD/PhD) but what I’ve seen of it so far, I’m not sure I like. I want to change the world and make a difference, as cheesy and naïve as that sounds, but that’s an idealism I don’t want to lose. More and more, I see pre-med and labwork drill it out of people. When I ask the people at lab why they’re doing what they’re doing, I’ve never been able to get a good answer and so many people seem to dislike their job. I for one have had a terrible experience working in labs at the bottom of an unsupportive hierarchy. Maybe I expected/wanted too much as a lowly undergrad and I’m projecting what I want to see and maybe the stereotype of the ultra-competitive serious pre-med isn’t true. 

Engineering: I love doing hands on things. I love building, crafts, designing, and generally working with my hands. I still have an idealized view of the culture, people, and environment where the people in CS and engineering are the quirky happy and slightly awkward nerds that I’m most comfortable with. I wish I’d explored engineering more last year before I had to make this choice, but that’s how things go and now I must deal with it. I also think (correct me if I’m wrong) that engineering has more to do with innovation than memorization whereas medicine is the other way around. 

This all sounds fine and dandy and writing this, I realize that it seems like engineering is a better fit, at least in terms of my attitude towards it, but the issue gets so much more complicated from here. For one thing, maybe it’s one of those things where the more you know about something, the more you know the faults and I know a lot more about medicine that I do engineering. Which is to say, maybe engineering isn’t as great as I think and maybe once I throw myself into it, I’ll find that it’s just as corrupt and tedious. There’s also the idea that if you see something corrupt, do you quit and leave it to fester as someone else’s problem or should you stay and try to fix/change it?

The more pressing issue though is that should I choose engineering, I would be essentially turning my back on my family and in the moments I’ve tried to probe this question, the conversation always escalates and I end up in tears. My family has already threatened to stop financing my education and let’s face it, college is expensive. I haven’t prepared and I have nothing saved up, but that’s not even the core issue because in the end, I think I can deal with financial isolation. It’s the emotional isolation and guilt that I don’t know if I can handle. My dad says things like “come home if you want, I don’t care” or “you can come home, but can’t stay with me.” He’s already gone as far as to refuse to pick me up for a far lesser infraction. I know these are scare tactics but it still hurts and I know why he worries. He thinks I’m lazy and that I’m taking the easy way out and he doesn’t want to see me miss opportunities, opportunities that he never got and would’ve cherished. I’m still young but to him, that invalidates my opinions and desires because I “don’t understand.” Even my sibling, who as I mentioned before is MD/PhD, who usually backs me up gets angry at me and I end up feeling like I’m being selfish and immature for even questioning. Because yes, people have given up a lot so I could be where I am today, but how much does/should that change what decisions I make for myself? I owe my family everything so what do I do? 

Whichever I choose, I want to devote myself to it. Pre-med is a sure thing: I can see how my life will pan out for at least the next ten years, more if I follow my sibling’s footsteps and do MD/PhD. But maybe that’s it, I want an individual career and life, not one that’s a carbon copy of my sibling. Medicine is also more practical: people will always need doctors and if everything tanks again, I’ll probably still have a job. Engineering is unknown: I have no idea what I would even potentially do with a mechE degree besides research/academia. Whatever mistakes, successes, or decisions would be completely my own, which is both terrifying and exhilarating. In the end I might realize engineering isn’t right for me and go back to pre-med, but my education would be set back a few years and I would have still caused my family so much pain. 

Yet even if I do pre-med, I don’t want to have my family nipping at my heels all the time. It seems that to gain the independence I want, I have to hurt the people I care about most. 

If you’ve made it through this post, I truly appreciate your time. You can probably tell how confused and lost I am.

So should I suck it up and stick with pre-med and try my best to find merit in it, some driving passion, or should I switch to engineering and ostracize myself from my family? If you are in either field, what is it like? Why/how did you decide to do it? And whatever my decision, how can I take control and responsibility of my life without hurting my family more than I have to?

[deleted],1422182636,/r/college/comments/2tlsbe/doubts_about_cc_and_then_some/,"Hey there, /r/college. You've probably all heard this one many times before, but here goes. I apologize in advance for the upcoming Great Wall of China of text. Brace yourselves.




I'm a 2014 high school graduate. While I always loved learning and was in AP classes, my utter laziness caused me to barely graduate high school, and now I haven't any choice but to go through CC if I want to pursue even a semblance of anything like a  higher quality education, which I absolutely do, both for reasons of personal intellectual fulfillment and because I don't want to be almost certainly stuck as working-class wage slave for the rest of my life. The kind of job I have right now just won't cut it for me for the approximate next 70 years of my human existence, assuming there aren't any complications along the way.




But I digress. You reap what you sow and my actions (or lack thereof) have landed me in CC. Now I'm fully aware (perhaps a bit grudgingly) that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as my local CC is one of the best in the nation and easily rivals some universities in certain aspects (not so much in many others, but you can't win everything). So while it's less than ideal (at least to a teenager), CC won't be a death sentence for me like it would in other places, and, financially, it's a sound idea, as my parents won't/can't contribute a penny to my tuition costs, and I don't have a couple thousand dollars to throw around for CC, let alone a good 20-50k/year for actual University. Ergo, this could all be a blessing in disguise, strictly financially speaking, since I haven't got the means to pay for college nor the luxury to waste time spending it superfluously trying to figure out what the hell to major in.




So here I am, bittersweet, half a week into my first semester of CC after a semester's break (7 months total) fresh out of high school to earn money via underpaid, mind-numbing labor, and, frankly,to get a bit of a break from school after 15 continuous years of it (I started young). Despite the wisdom in going to a good CC for someone in my position, I can't help but feel a bit sad and regretful of ending up there, for relatively superficial reasons. I see all of my friends shipped off to places near and far, living in dorms with their roommates (for better or for worse), all in one building with friends and foes and crushes alike, going through the ups and downs and all the antics that come with being a freshman, and I feel like I'm missing out on some fun times. While I understand that dorm life isn't all it's cracked up to be, I still wish to go through the experience of it, to make new, long-lasting friendships, and experience the independence and learning that comes with the ""college experience"". While the fact that I am now left here, with all my classmatess and acquaintances gone in and out of state to schools, while I stay behind a counter and greet the faceless entity of customers 5-7 hours a day, is entirely my own fault, I still wish to live that social aspect ASAP, especially after being deprived of any interaction with anyone within 5 years of my own age for nearly 8 months now. I'm lonely. I didn't really have any friends before, more just acquiantances, but now my interaction with people my age is at 0. I don't get to be independent, I'm still stuck with my family. I love them all very dearly, and they're all great, but I feel so suffocated. In all 19 years of my life, I've been with them. I've never  really had much of a social life. I want to get out, to meet people. To get drunk for the first time, to pull all-nighters, to feel the stress of exams, to learn all those little life lessons, to make long-lasting friendships. Right now my life is this boring, monotonous loop, and I'm alone in it. 



So, with all of this (most likely gratuitous) babbling done, I have these questions:




What is the quickest way to get out of CC and into my university of choice (which requires the wonderful range of 12-36 credits for transfer, I'll shoot for 15+ because I don't have some relative that will pay for most/all of my tuition, and I have a grand total of roughly $1600 under my name), without rushing it and doing more harm than good? Please consider the fact that in all my years of school, the extent of my studying ended with the school bell, so I don't have any study skills whatsoever, thus making me take 5 classes/semester right off the bat a bit too ambitious of an idea to be of any benefit to me.




Ultimately, does the opportunity cost of saving a few thousand dollars outweigh the lessons and experience learned through an early and true college immersion? (I understand that this is nearly entirely subjective, and that's perfectly fine.)



Is ""the college experience"" really all it's cracked up to be? Can a transfer student still live that lifestyle and experience that iconic chapter in life fully with a maximum of 2 years to experience it all? What would be the best course of action?



And finally



Should one even go to college, at all? Is it even worth it? Honestly, nowadays, it seems like less and less of a good idea to go to college if you aren't 90+% sure about your current path in life.



I just can't help but feel regret at this point, yet I am also well aware of the rising costs of tuition, or of the danger of mindlessly abiding by the somewhat misplaced cultural idea that  no college= no success, especially in today's globalized economy. I understand, rationally, that CC is actually becoming more and more of a wiser option, provided your local CC isn't absolute shit, and/or you aren't absolutely certain about what you want to do with your life. I get that. But there's that whimsical side of me that's slipping into a depression because I'm deprived of all social interaction,  drudging through each day where the person nearest to me in age is a 30-something alcoholic, lest you count my 13 year-old sister. I want to make friends, I want to find myself, as I don't even know who I am. I want to forge strong relationships, and have the opportunity to meet many people of different backgrounds, and the chance to thrive intellectually and be humbled by those superior to me in that aspect. Being a hostess at a restaurant is hardly conducive to rich, fulfilling intelligent conversation. I'm just bored of life right now. Bored of the daily grind, the colorless monotony of it all. And if not through college or travel to some faraway place, where else will I find a place where young people just like me are clustered together, united under a common goal?



Sorry if this got melodramatic/preachy. I'm just utterly bored, and unhappy, and want to get out of it ASAP. ",college,"Doubts about CC, and then some",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2tlsbe/doubts_about_cc_and_then_some/,1422204236.0,can't pay for school,8.066666666666666
7medium,1581388669,/r/college/comments/f21omt/what_is_with_all_of_the_bad_press_for_full_sail/,"I’m going to be attending Full Sail sometime this August/September and I’ve never been more excited. I’m entering the Game Design course and could not be more stoked. So far I have had nothing but positive experiences with people from Financial Aid and any other service trying to help, really. From what I’ve been through during enrollment and setting everything up, it’s been great. 

However, recently I’ve encountered a lot of less-than-stellar feedback - most notably from older Reddit posts. This surprised me because from the alumni I know, I’ve heard nothing but praise - other than the workload being heavy but manageable. People claim it’s a scam, a corporate cash-grab, and utterly useless. I’m looking for some fresh opinions on the matter to try to understand where this is from. 

TL;DR From what I’ve experienced, Full-Sail is very non-traditional and not for everyone but it does so much to cater to its students to provide everything they need to be successful. So where is all of this negativity coming from when all I've seen from my first-hand experience is positive? 


I want to address some points I have already seen first, but I'm open to opinions.

Mostly I’ve seen claims that:

1. It’s a for-profit mill that just wants your money. 

There are many for-profit colleges. Sure, some can be shady as goes with any business but it’s unfair to judge only on that. Theoretically, a good for-profit college would strategically strive to create quality education to appeal to shareholders. It can seem intimidating at first but the business moto allows for more out of the box approaches and fewer limitations.

The money being made also goes to the students. Tours of Full Sail have shown that they provide top-quality resources. The campus is beautiful and has mind-blowing equipment and full film sets the size of a shopping district. The money being made is really being put into use for the students and alumni.

2. The tuition is way too high and the Financial Aid services are only there to get you loans so they can take your money.  

After some simple research, it seems Florida’s average tuition for 4-year colleges is about $14k which would be roughly $56k for all 4 years.

Full Sail’s average total paid tuition for a bachelor’s is about $55k. This is on-par with the average. For comparison, UCF’s average tuition for 4-years is in the $60k range. 

In my personal experience, the Financial Aid program did whatever they could to help me. They didn’t shove loans down my throat and, instead, guided me to scholarships. The qualifications for these scholarships were reasonable and weren’t very demanding. The only thing I needed to do was write one 500 word essay about creativity. After everything, I - a semi-decent student who absolutely hated school and struggled to keep up - got enough for a full ride and then some, all without loans. It felt too easy.

Another note, they even offer monthly aid for students to comfortably live off of while in class. If you play your cards right and do your research, you can get paid to attend.

3. The workload is too crammed, you’re getting less education.

From what I understand, Full Sail is very non-traditional. Over a 20 - 28 month span, students are taking about 1 to 2 (maybe 3 at *most*) classes per month. To many, this seems unreasonable and many would wonder how anyone is getting anything useful out of it. 

After doing workshops, speaking with alumni, and talking with counselors, what I understand is that it’s more or less streamlined. Traditional colleges have semesters that are 12 - 15 weeks where students take usually 4 - 6 classes. In the same timeframe, Full Sail students will have taken 4 - 8 classes. In addition, there are fewer breaks. The total number of classes attended and hours spent learning are generously much higher for students at Full Sail.

It can be argued that you can’t learn much from one month of taking a class. To that, I say that it’s circumstantial. Professors recommend that students do not work during their time enrolled unless they want to get burnt out. So you’d be giving your undivided attention to the coursework. Also, I’d say that taking one or two classes at a time is actually a much better system for absorbing information. 

Full Sail is very different in it’s approach to education. Most of us are used to growing up and going to school taking 6 - 8 classes (depending on the school system) each year. This is what we’re used to. However, it can be argued that switching between so many different subjects so frequently is distracting and can be overwhelming. For many, it is better to focus on a few things than jump from Math to History to Art to Foreign Language. 

As a personal anecdote: during the end of high school, I had started struggling to keep up with the courses and my GPA was dropping. My parents made the call to enroll me in virtual school online. At first, I did the same thing, balancing many classes at once. That was until I decided to try taking one class at a time and going through it in a month or so. It was one of the best decisions I made and everything started to become easier. I absorbed the information much faster and retained it for longer. 

To be fair, this learning style is not for everyone. Many people would do much better in the traditional setting. However, Full Sail seems to want to attract passionate and eccentric students who aren't the norm. For learning disabilities like ADHD, strategically hyper-focusing on one class is a blessing. 

On another note, there really aren’t filler classes. I know many people who have gone to college and wound up taking a lot of basic core classes that didn't benefit their major at all. While that isn’t always true, it definitely isn’t true for Full Sail. The core classes are developed for the student’s course so that every class is going to end up being beneficial.

4. The dropout rate is high. 

43% doesn’t look very good. Touching back on the previous point: the course regiment isn’t for everyone. Those without experience in the unique setting could find that they don’t fare very well with that type of learning. 

With that being said, the acceptance rate is 100%. Generally, colleges with higher graduation rates also have a very low acceptance rate. Most universities are trying to get the best students to make themselves look better. Colleges with a 70% graduation rate are accepting only 50% of students. 

5. Courses like Game Design are worthless credentials. Employers are looking for experience, not a degree. 

Unlike many colleges, Full Sail is designed to give real-world experience and to build up an expanded portfolio. You’re not going to be thrown information and then released into the real world, you’re going to work on real projects so that you’re immediately ready to take charge. The professors are equipping students with the tools and experience that employers are looking for and there will be a lot of evidence to show for it.

EagleAtlas,1617854840,/r/college/comments/mmjnmf/a_message_to_incoming_freshmen_from_a_senior_bio/,"The following is a list of tips that genuinely helped me over the last 4 years in university, and I hope some incoming freshmen can gain something from them as well. (Based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mmdid6/what_are_some_dorming_tips_youd_give_incoming/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share))    
    


1. **Go to your professors' office hours!**    

Try to make a habit of going to every one of your professors office hours at least once each week (even if it's on Zoom). This way they can learn who you are both as a student and as a person. That'll make it both easier for them to help you, and be more willing to help you (e.g. they may not take points/as many points away on quizzes and exams for topics they know you've been struggling with [this is not guaranteed, but I've personally experienced this at least one time every semester for the last 4 years]).    

Your professors want you to be interested in and learn the material as best as possible (well at least most of the professors I've had felt this way). If you show them that you're making a conscious effort to work hard and do well in their class, more than likely they'll reciprocate some, if not all, of that effort back into helping you. ""Helping"" could mean anything from spending a little extra time in office hours, to spending non-office hour days trying to help you through problem sets, to not taking points off for parts of assessments that you got incorrect (when other people would get points taken off for the same mistakes).    

(*Tangent*) Prior to COVID, I tried to make sure that I went to each of my professors office hours at least once a week. I started doing this for two reasons 1) because my father recommended it in our father son talk the night before my family took me to school, and 2) I felt awkward asking questions in front of large classes. Since COVID hit, I've personally found it harder to attend Zoom based office hours, even though I know I should.    

College can be incredibly intimidating at first, especially if you get stuck with rigid first year/semester professors. However, from personal experience, as long as you show them you're interested (even if you're not because it's some gen ed., just act like you are) they'll be very willing to help you. As they get to know how you learn and who you are as a person, they'll be able to explain things in ways that make more sense than they did during lectures/while reading the textbooks.    

2. **Try to sit in the front row of your class**, you might get picked to answer questions by the professor more often, but that will be an incentive to learn the material!    

3. **College is exactly what you make of it**    

College will be based on your mindset/outlook, and it will be exactly what you expect it to be, regardless of what your expectations are. 
*If you keep a nonchalant attitude, you'll see that even the most stressful challenges will come to pass. 
*If you came to party and chill, you'll have a great time... But try remember to submit your assignments prior to the night they're due. 
*If you're dedicated to working hard and trying to do the best you possibly can (i.e. me), it's okay to try and cool off every now and again, you don't need to work yourself to death before you even hit the workforce.    
The examples can continue forever.    

(*Tangent/Message to past me*) I can't tell you how many times I've heard this last point over the last 4 years, but it's true; I know that there are countless experiences that I let slip through the cracks because I felt as though I couldn't take a break from my work - do as I say, not as I do. If you're working hard, you'll do fine. So feel free to let loose every now and again, meet new people (literally, if you're given the chance to meet new people, do it; I don't mean just walk up to some random person with your hand outstretched and ask ""what's your name? My name's [name here]!"" that'll get weird looks... or pepper spray...), get out of the library/your dorm a every now and again if for no other reason than to get some sun and fresh air.    

4. **Try something out of your comfort zone!**    

This could mean answering a question in class, speaking to that person you find attractive, joining a club that seems interesting but deals with something you've never tried before, and the list goes on. However, this doesn't mean to try something that you find morally wrong, like if you're against doing drugs and alcohol, don't feel obligated to join in (peer pressure is not like it is in movies, or how high school taught it, but it is still a thing); but also, don't try to tell everyone that they shouldn't be doing it because you don't think it's okay (unless it involves hurting another person, then you have every right to speak up).    

5. **Don't feel shy, ask other people if you can hang with them!**    

If a person's door is open in your hall, and you see people hanging out, feel free to knock and ask if you can hang with them. If that group doesn't turn out to be your crowd, just continue this process until you find the right people. The ""right people"" may not be in your hall, or maybe in your building, just try to open yourself up to talk to people and you'll find your best friends eventually :)    

If it just so happens that you were the only one from your high school to go to your university and your feeling like an outcast, use that as your literal opening line. (Preface, in high school I was very shy, I wasn't against talking to others, but I struggled to initiate conversations with new people) This is how I felt when I first went to school, the last person from my high school that went to this university graduated 12 years prior to me starting. On my first day, I saw a small group of people talking and laughing together outside my building, so with the help of my father's words from the night prior, I mustered up the courage to walk over and just introduce myself. To the best of my recollection this is what I said (or at least something very close to it): ""I'm sorry for interrupting, but my name's Daniel. I don't know anyone so I was wondering if I could hangout with you guys?"" They welcomed me with open arms, stating that they were the exact same. That one interaction has stuck with me more than really any other, because it showed me that it's not that challenging to talk to others, you just need to muster up some confidence (even if, in the back of your mind, you're freaking out).    
    

All in all, good luck. This is a crazy world we're living in, who knows what could happen over the next 4 years. Also, if you read all of this, good job!

I'm a really, really terrible student. I'm the sort of person that, halfway through college I'm still just straight up not showing up or not doing homework (and double majoring in math and philosophy no less, so huge portions of my grades rely on it). Even if I do homework, sometimes I'll take a 0 before I turn in an assignment that I haven't completed. It's the same thing with quizzes (another large portion of the grade): if I feel I am shaky on material I will sometimes just not go rather than do poorly. This has resulted in a 2.7 GPA that has been absolutely all over the place, and frankly I'm surprised it's even that high. Obviously, I recognize the faults in these behaviors, and those times when I am consistent studying I can achieve good results. Sometimes the late nights studying will pay off in the most ridiculous ways and I'll get an A on a 20 page paper that was supposed to take weeks in only a night of work, or be near the top of a curve on a calculus test because I stumbled across the fountain of youth of studying strategies. Inevitably, these situations have become farther and farther away from each other, and I've never been so aware of that until now. Those are the things I can change.

What I'm afraid I can't change, is two-fold:

1. I'm a second semester sophomore whose semester is finishing up, and I'm **horrifically** far behind in my Linear Algebra class. I missed about two and a half weeks of school because of an abscess in my throat (as often as I fool myself into thinking I'm actually sick, you'd think I would have been more capable of dealing with actually being sick). I kicked my ass to get caught up on the midterm that I got pushed back to the week I expected to recover, and probably would have done decently well had I not gotten a bad sinus infection that Monday (and I want to reiterate that these are not feigned illnesses nor excuses to miss class; I wish I had been able to take the exam). My professor told me that I could take the final as my midterm, resulting in the final being worth a whopping 45% of my grade. In the meantime, I did very little to stay caught up. I attended class, but I only did about half of the homework assignments and missed at least one quiz. I kept pushing my studying back, and even when started it was always late at night and I was incapacitated with exhaustion the next day. I didn't request a leave of absence, I didn't go to office hours, I fucking missed a makeup quiz, and dropped probably my easiest class a yet inexplicable reason. All of the opportunities I had to rectify or postpone this semester (at least as far as this class are concerned) are gone. I might be able to scrape a C in the class, but if I do I won't deserve it at all. Any suggestions regarding cramming/anything related to walking into an exam worth 45% of one's grade completely unprepared would be welcome. This is a class I've taken before (though, granted under an extremely poor teacher and I retook it not because I didn't pass but because I felt I didn't learn anything), and is a class that I need to get a C or higher in to earn my major.

2. Every single time I approach finals season I find myself in this dilemma. I realize how fucked I am and what a terrible student I am, generally whipping myself into a first class frenzy instead of taking what time I have left to study. When I end up passing with mediocre to poor grades (I've been sitting at a B- average the entirety of my time at college), I swear that I'll do the right thing the next semester. And I do know what the right thing is, it just never ends up getting done. At this point in my college experience, when I've halfway determined how this is all going to turn out (excepting summer classes or additional years - which I'll get to later), it's obvious that this is no longer an easy thing to convince myself of. As crass as I've come off in this post, I've frankly been more down in the past couple of weeks than I have in a very long time. My room's a mess, I don't really have any food to eat, I don't hang out with my friends very often. I just inefficiently study and sleep. I really know I can do it, because there are long moments when I've tried hard and done well. But I just don't, again and again. I'm so embarrassed that I've backed myself into a corner of lies to my friends and family and they don't know how poorly this is all going, and I can't even tell my therapist (whom I've continued seeing since I started seeing her last year because of some drug abuse) because it's like speaking it makes it more true. 

It's true that this semester was unusually difficult for me because of pledging a fraternity, initially working almost 28 hours (another instance of me actively choosing to do something extremely difficult - my parents just said that I had to get a job and I picked hard labor in warehouse at nearly 30 hours a week), getting very sick and staying that way for a while, but even though I tell myself that and have told my mom that this semester won't go well because of that, I know that the underlying issue is that I'm ultimately not a good student. What's more, my laziness turns into really awful self-hatred and manic motivation that leads me to go up to 48 hours on only a few hours of sleep. 

Almost done, after a very lengthy post. I'm lucky enough to be going to a good school that my parents are paying for completely. Summer classes and extra years are on the table financially (and the two summer classes I've taken have resulted in some of my more successful classes), though obviously this would be something I'd like to avoid. Both my mom and my dad have doctorates and very highly value education, though my dad went through a similar experience his freshman year. They're very supportive and I would suspect my mom has an idea of what's going on, but despite the financial capability  they have my overriding feeling is guilt that I'm flushing this all down the toilet. 

Obviously, this is a complex issue and in retrospect I don't know if I would read through a post this long. I'd be extremely grateful to anyone with any sort of advice, anecdote, or outright criticism. Please be honest with me reddit, because I've gotten to the point where I don't even know how to be honest with myself.

Alviv1945,1608238906,/r/college/comments/kf66lo/uni_changed_roommate_rules_between_semesters_help/,"Hey Reddit!  
This issue is a bit on the strange side, and it's not a direct issue with my roommate, but moreso the school and last-minute changes involving roommates. It takes some explanation but I will add a TL:DR at the bottom.  
Note that this is for a university in the state of Washington (but I won't list the specific school as I'm not sure what the consequences would be).  
Currently a Freshman. 

**Background:**  
Early July I was in a car accident that had me in a boot for five months. I couldn't walk properly and needed a lot of help getting around and accessing things. I also have pretty severe anxiety. At the same time, my roommate has some mental health issues that are better handled when not alone. As of our application for the Fall Semester, the school was allowing some exceptions for roommates, however, most people were placed into single dorms due to COVID. We both agreed that not having a roommate or someone around would be detrimental to our health, and accepted the terms that should either of us get COVID, we would both quarantine. We also either dined in the provided spaces in the dining hall or in our rooms to prevent further spread. If we hung out with friends outside of our dorms, we took all precautions not to get each other sick (which was good, because I'm immunocompromised). We only ever visited our dorm supervisor and one other friend a couple of floors down, but even then it was 6ft/2m away in the hall. Neither of us got COVID for the entirety of the semester, and our campus peaked at 14 (I think) cases for the entire semester despite plenty of parties taking place on other floors (none of which we attended).  


My roommate is genuinely awesome too. Personal issues aside, we'd figured out a cleaning schedule for the room within 3 days, and became very dependent on each other. We both have issues remembering to eat/sleep/take care of ourselves, but we can take advantage of that fun anxiety loophole where we feel the urge to remind the other to do those things. We have an established schedule where I leave to go study in the library/shower during her therapy sessions, and we both watch our fav show on Thursdays on the TV. On top of that, we share a LOT of things, including but not limited to:  
\-TV  
\-Scent diffusers/air fresheners  
\-Nintendo Switch  
\-Humidifier  
\-Curtains  
\-Rug  
\-Clothes drying rack  
\-Mirror  
\-Watering can for plants  
\-Heating pads for ladies week  
\-Microwave splash screen  
\-Cleaning supplies  
\-Trash bags  
\-Milk, cheese, veggies, candy, most leftovers  
\-Study supplies

As of yesterday, my roommate called the housing department to get specifics on how moving back in would work. We had flights back into the state planned for the same day, planned to share an uber/lyft, and help each other with luggage and she wanted to make sure we didn't mess anything up.   
Later she calls me crying upon being told that everyone was now being moved to single dorms upon the Dean's request. The Housing Department doesn't like this decision and is trying to fight it, but if that fight is lost, that puts us (and the few others who have roommates for similar reasons) in a really bad position. One of us will be required to move down the hall, which for either of us includes several lbs of books, sheets, shelving units, clothes, luggage, shoes, and those major shared items that we own (me owning the TV, Curtians, Air Fresheners, Rug, Drying Rack, Cleaning Supplies and most Study Supplies, leaving her needing to purchase those) while I'm still doing intense physical therapy for my leg/foot. On top of that, either one of us frequently forgets keys and tends to sit outside for 30+ minutes out of fear of interrupting a class. I also don't know if either of us can afford a single dorm (if the school is changing rooming prices).  
Oh, and also, my folks won't even let me go back to campus without a roommate. 

I want to be able to have a somewhat normal and healthy college experience. I respect the precautions the school is taking against COVID, but with our previous arrangement, neither of us ever got it and if anything we were better holding each other accountable for both being aware of COVID and for other things- like eating, sleeping, starting class/studying, getting out of our pajamas, etc. This change feels super last minute, as the official email from the school was only sent out today and we had to plan way in advance to afford flights into the state and appointments to get COVID tests within a reasonable time before our arrival. When we signed up to have a roommate, we both signed a roommate agreement and were under the impression that things would remain this way for the entirety of the school year, as we were worried about having to move rooms in the first place. As far as I understand, the CDC isn't requiring or even recommending students to be strictly single dormed anyway... I'm just very confused and shaken up. 

Parents on both ends have tried calling in and were promised calls from housing withing 24 hours (they're all upset as well). No one has called back and it's getting close to the employee's winter break.  


**TL:DR**  
Beginning of school year, roommate and I were one of a few pairs permitted to room together due to COVID. We needed roommates due to physical and mental health issues in which being alone would be detrimental to our health. We were told that we wouldn't have to worry about later changing rooms. We both share 15+ major expensive items and those mental health issues are still prevalent. W  
We agreed to quarantine if one of us got COVID and hold each other responsible for COVID related health precautions. We've both developed a good relationship and depend on each other for a lot, and we feel like the other is the only normalcy we have left. We both had to sign up for appointments for COVID testing and flights back into Washington weeks in advance to afford them/have them at reasonable times.   
As of today, the school has officially stated that all students are being moved into single dorms, despite the state not requiring it. Neither of us can afford that and my own parents will not allow me to return to the school without a roommate. I feel my own mental health would suffer if I went back, and I'd also struggle to move everything to another room with the still persisting injury to my foot.   
Both sets of parents and ourselves have tried contacting the school for specifics or alternatives or at least to put in our two cents. We were promised calls back within 24 hours... and have yet to receive any calls. 

Can the school do this?

Alviv1945,1608238906,/r/college/comments/kf66lo/uni_changed_roommate_rules_between_semesters_help/,"Hey Reddit!  
This issue is a bit on the strange side, and it's not a direct issue with my roommate, but moreso the school and last-minute changes involving roommates. It takes some explanation but I will add a TL:DR at the bottom.  
Note that this is for a university in the state of Washington (but I won't list the specific school as I'm not sure what the consequences would be).  
Currently a Freshman. 

**Background:**  
Early July I was in a car accident that had me in a boot for five months. I couldn't walk properly and needed a lot of help getting around and accessing things. I also have pretty severe anxiety. At the same time, my roommate has some mental health issues that are better handled when not alone. As of our application for the Fall Semester, the school was allowing some exceptions for roommates, however, most people were placed into single dorms due to COVID. We both agreed that not having a roommate or someone around would be detrimental to our health, and accepted the terms that should either of us get COVID, we would both quarantine. We also either dined in the provided spaces in the dining hall or in our rooms to prevent further spread. If we hung out with friends outside of our dorms, we took all precautions not to get each other sick (which was good, because I'm immunocompromised). We only ever visited our dorm supervisor and one other friend a couple of floors down, but even then it was 6ft/2m away in the hall. Neither of us got COVID for the entirety of the semester, and our campus peaked at 14 (I think) cases for the entire semester despite plenty of parties taking place on other floors (none of which we attended).  


My roommate is genuinely awesome too. Personal issues aside, we'd figured out a cleaning schedule for the room within 3 days, and became very dependent on each other. We both have issues remembering to eat/sleep/take care of ourselves, but we can take advantage of that fun anxiety loophole where we feel the urge to remind the other to do those things. We have an established schedule where I leave to go study in the library/shower during her therapy sessions, and we both watch our fav show on Thursdays on the TV. On top of that, we share a LOT of things, including but not limited to:  
\-TV  
\-Scent diffusers/air fresheners  
\-Nintendo Switch  
\-Humidifier  
\-Curtains  
\-Rug  
\-Clothes drying rack  
\-Mirror  
\-Watering can for plants  
\-Heating pads for ladies week  
\-Microwave splash screen  
\-Cleaning supplies  
\-Trash bags  
\-Milk, cheese, veggies, candy, most leftovers  
\-Study supplies

As of yesterday, my roommate called the housing department to get specifics on how moving back in would work. We had flights back into the state planned for the same day, planned to share an uber/lyft, and help each other with luggage and she wanted to make sure we didn't mess anything up.   
Later she calls me crying upon being told that everyone was now being moved to single dorms upon the Dean's request. The Housing Department doesn't like this decision and is trying to fight it, but if that fight is lost, that puts us (and the few others who have roommates for similar reasons) in a really bad position. One of us will be required to move down the hall, which for either of us includes several lbs of books, sheets, shelving units, clothes, luggage, shoes, and those major shared items that we own (me owning the TV, Curtians, Air Fresheners, Rug, Drying Rack, Cleaning Supplies and most Study Supplies, leaving her needing to purchase those) while I'm still doing intense physical therapy for my leg/foot. On top of that, either one of us frequently forgets keys and tends to sit outside for 30+ minutes out of fear of interrupting a class. I also don't know if either of us can afford a single dorm (if the school is changing rooming prices).  
Oh, and also, my folks won't even let me go back to campus without a roommate. 

I want to be able to have a somewhat normal and healthy college experience. I respect the precautions the school is taking against COVID, but with our previous arrangement, neither of us ever got it and if anything we were better holding each other accountable for both being aware of COVID and for other things- like eating, sleeping, starting class/studying, getting out of our pajamas, etc. This change feels super last minute, as the official email from the school was only sent out today and we had to plan way in advance to afford flights into the state and appointments to get COVID tests within a reasonable time before our arrival. When we signed up to have a roommate, we both signed a roommate agreement and were under the impression that things would remain this way for the entirety of the school year, as we were worried about having to move rooms in the first place. As far as I understand, the CDC isn't requiring or even recommending students to be strictly single dormed anyway... I'm just very confused and shaken up. 

Parents on both ends have tried calling in and were promised calls from housing withing 24 hours (they're all upset as well). No one has called back and it's getting close to the employee's winter break.  


**TL:DR**  
Beginning of school year, roommate and I were one of a few pairs permitted to room together due to COVID. We needed roommates due to physical and mental health issues in which being alone would be detrimental to our health. We were told that we wouldn't have to worry about later changing rooms. We both share 15+ major expensive items and those mental health issues are still prevalent. W  
We agreed to quarantine if one of us got COVID and hold each other responsible for COVID related health precautions. We've both developed a good relationship and depend on each other for a lot, and we feel like the other is the only normalcy we have left. We both had to sign up for appointments for COVID testing and flights back into Washington weeks in advance to afford them/have them at reasonable times.   
As of today, the school has officially stated that all students are being moved into single dorms, despite the state not requiring it. Neither of us can afford that and my own parents will not allow me to return to the school without a roommate. I feel my own mental health would suffer if I went back, and I'd also struggle to move everything to another room with the still persisting injury to my foot.   
Both sets of parents and ourselves have tried contacting the school for specifics or alternatives or at least to put in our two cents. We were promised calls back within 24 hours... and have yet to receive any calls. 

Can the school do this? Is there anywhere in WA law that states they can't, as we've already signed our roommate agreement and were given verbal confirmation that we would not have to move rooms previously? Does anyone have any advice?

domremy7,1356069559,/r/AskReddit/comments/157plj/my_mom_is_trying_to_move_us_30_minutes_away_from/,"I'm not really sure where to post this. I'll try to make it short.

My parents got divorced when I was around 7 and my dad went through a really hard time. He lived in a studio apartment alone for a short while, until he met my stepmom and moved into a small house. Now, my dad is a really hard worker and actually makes a lot of money, but my mom didn't have a job and refused to get one until she got a teaching credential, so all we were living on was the child support she got from my dad. He always blamed her for this, it's one of the many reasons he hates her, and for a while I didn't know what to believe, and I still don't. But the thing is, my brother and I were having some trouble because we had basically no money--my dad paid a lot of child support but it wasn't enough for us to be comfortable--and we wanted her to find work. Of course, our dad wanted her to find work, too. He wanted her to find a high-paying job that would support us, but she didn't. The only thing I can say about this is that I hear so many stories about how people's parents work so hard to make life comfortable for them, and I think that applies to my dad, but I'll never be able to confidently say it about my mom. I don't know if that's a lot to expect.

So, anyway, my dad got married and eventually had kids, my two sisters who are both more than ten years younger than me, and he's been fighting for us to spend more time with them (and him) ever since. I love those girls with all my heart and the thought of ever spending any less time with them than I do makes me want to cry. 

My parents have been taking each other to court for over five years since their divorce, mostly with my mom emerging victorious due to her being a woman, as far as I can tell. She filed a few bullcrap stuff with them that I cannot ever think of a reason for (when we moved into a four bedroom house, which had to eventually fit seven people--it's crowded but it's the best my dad and his wife could do since he was paying my mom so much that they couldn't get a loan or something--she complained that us sleeping in bunkbeds in the same room was insufficient, when there was nowhere else to sleep and it really was an upgrade from the air mattresses we'd been sleeping on for so long). He was always so angry with her, and the court system, and he's been telling us for so long that he just wants to spend time with us and for us to become part of his family. It wasn't like that at first, but when my oldest sister was born his determination for us to see her as much as we possibly could accelerated. We're finally at a point, beginning with the start of the school year, where we spend more time with them and this is the closest my brother and I ever been to being completely satisfied with the time we spend with our dad and his family. It's been really, really great.

The thing is, now my mom wants to move. She's been bugging everyone for a while about moving out of the county we live in, because the houses are expensive, and because she has a (sort-of) new boyfriend who lives about forty minutes away. She's been telling us that she simply cannot stay in our town anymore and that we have to move. Our dad's been living in the same town as us for about a year now, before that he was living 15 minutes away and I guess he was finally ready to move closer to our mom. We were so excited because why else would he move here but to be closer to us? His work has always been quite far away from here, the place he used to live is closer, and there's really nothing here. But Mom told us not to get our hopes up because we couldn't be sure that was the reason.

Apparently she's been getting really serious about moving now. She's been talking to me about going to high school in the town where her boyfriend lives and trying to convince me--by using other people, even--that it would be a good idea, and that it would be good for all of us. The thing is, it's not true. I have had my heart absolutely set on one of the high schools here, which has a really good arts program besides being the place where all my friends are going, and I would be able to see my dad after school. My mom said we could still go to a school in this town even if we don't live in it, but my dad said he called the district and all we could do would be to apply for a transfer because we don't see him often enough to use his address as our residence. He then asked for more time with us, and my mom said no. She didn't tell me anything about that.

Anyway, and this is coming to a close, my dad just told me that he's so fed up with her and her ""games"" and all her crap that he's about to give up. He's spent so much time fighting, he says, and he's getting older now and he just wants to live. He wants to be free from her like he's wanted since the moment they divorced, and I've seen how hard it is on him to keep fighting the court system and the woman who's abusing it. He says that he won't respond to anything she says, he won't go to court, he won't do anything. He wants to see us and this action (or lack thereof) is not supposed to be any indication of how much he loves us, but I think he's afraid. I'm afraid. I don't want to be one of those kids who grows up without a father, and I will fight till the last breath to stay with him instead of moving away with my mom as I'm sure she'll do, but I don't know what to do. I love them both, but I hate them both too for the way they treat each other, but I'm afraid and I want my sisters to grow up with me in the house and I just want someone to talk to. If anyone has anything, any way to fight my mom when the time comes or any encouraging stories about getting through stuff like this (or another subreddit to post this in, perhaps), I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

tl;dr: Mom wants to move me and my brother away from our dad and two half-sisters to be with her boyfriend. That means I can't go to high school at my dream school, in my hometown.

SeeminglyUseless,1284093609,/r/AskReddit/comments/dbxq1/i_hate_my_life_and_want_to_change_things_only_i/,"Hi Reddit. I've made a couple posts, but I haven't really put much effort into it. Allow me to summarize my life story:
Basically, my life has been /shit/ for the last year and a half or so. Cut to 2 years ago:
I'm currently 19-20 years of age, going to school studying psychology. Things are going well. I'm a nerd/geek, so thusly, I haven't really had any serious relationships (I was a virgin). Doing well in school. Then my mother got sick. Breast cancer. She's been growing sick for the last year. It got to a point where the pain was beyond tolerance and she went to a clinic, where she got a quick diagnosis. This is where things took a turn for the worst.

She began treatment, and all the normal shit associated with this came along with it. She started chemo/radiation treatments and lost the ability to work. As such, the funding for my education fell through. I decided to drop out of school and take care of her. While my dad was working (and his job ended soon thereafter), I was basically at the local hospital 24/7 with my mother, doing anything from fetching food to massaging feet, trying to actually do anything to help alleviate the situation. Shit was rough, needless to say.

After about 8 months or so, my mother started getting better. She responded well to treatment, and things started looking up. She ended up being an out patient. Life went back to normal, somewhat. She showed increased amounts of vigor and energy. ONly this was concealed by her own pride. She was actually getting worse, and tired from the repeated rounds of chemo and radiation treatments. She was started on daily pills of Hydromorphone to help ease the pain. Me, being a dumb fucking bastard, decided to steal some to get high. I ended up getting addicted (taking upwards of 10 pills of 4MG orally each /just/ to get high) to the pills. About a month of this later, I detoxed myself by locking myself in my room. A very sobering experience, to say the least. And things started to look up. I got a job with my best friend, and gained the interest of a woman (introduced by said friend). after about 4 months of being aloof and 'ignorant"", I ended up hooking up with said chick. This began a very long relationship. about 8 months into this relationship, things were going alright, when she cheated on me with a foreigner (a dude from Ireland who was in town for 6 months). I forgave her but broke up with her. It was rough, and I felt hurt and betrayed, but I felt an equal amount of love towards her. Then, out of the blue, my mother passed away. She was in the hospital for some influenza/trouble breathing type symptoms, and we were called in 3 days later and told she has passed away. This led me and my family (Father and my sister, 5 years younger) basically into a crying fit and a bit of depression. We stuck together but things weren't gonna be the same. The same night my mom passed away, me and my ex hooked up. She found out (through friend of a friend) that my mom had died, and contacted me to hang out and talk about stuff. She ended up spending the night and we decided to get back together. I then (over the course of a couple months) ended up moving out on my own, then in with my girlfriend, into my own apartment. With a bit of inheritance (almost 13k$). My only family (Father and sister) moved away or out of town. My relationship was going alright, although I had my share of issues. I was facing depression and lethargy, basically not wanting to do anything. Through my inactivity and my overall decision to disconnect from reality, I ended up bailing my gf out of credit card debt, about 2k$ worth.

Then, shit hit the fan. She cheated on me, again. I dumped her, and kicked her out of my apartment. This lead to her having a breakdown (She's had mental issues in the past), and basically never giving me back the money she owed me. Before anyone asks, Yes, I know without a doubt, she cheated on me. When I confronted her with my evidence, she didn't deny it at all. She just broke down and ended up moving out. I basically lived off the rest of my inheritance until it ran out. Then I got a job (barely escaping being homeless), and have basically been working paycheck to paycheck ever since. The breakup happened about 5 months ago. 2 months ago, she texts me saying her friend was in the hospital, and she had nobody else to turn to, because i ""kept her sane"". We ended up hooking up again, but me refusing to go back into a relationship with her (thanks to the advice of some very good friends).

So this leads me to my current situation. I'm in relatively active contact with the ex (we text/call eachother every couple of weeks), and I can't help but feel like total shit. I tried to go back to trade school, but was denied my application due to failure to produce documents, desite my incessant nagging towards corporate entities. So i was forced to get a job to pay rent (because I'm alone in the province), and have no choice but to work or else I'd end up homeless. 

I live in a shitty apartment (With a shitty fucking landlord, and no way to get out of my predicament.). This apartment is infested with cockroaches and a blocked/leaky sink. My landlord was notified of the situation a month ago, with 0 change in my situation.

TLDR; My mom is dead, my family is out of town (up to about 8 hours drive away), my friends are a decent distance away from me, i can barely afford rent and food, I live in a cockroach infested shitty apartment, and I feel myself slipping and giving up on life. My girlfriend (First) and love of my life cheated on me and left me to rot with 2k$ of debt. 

So after trying for months to figure out what I'm gonna do, I  have come to no answers. So I need advice/answers, askreddit. I feel like shit, I can barely force myself out of bed in the morning to face the day, and I derive no type of happiness out of life. What do I do? Do I kill myself? I'd love to go back to school, but any government support programs have obviously failed me. I'm lonely, subsist entirely on the social interaction of a few online friends, and can see absolutely no bright side to my life. I'm in tears, and can barely bring myself to submit this. Is it so much to just want a happy life, simple and without drama?

If there's any more info needed, just ask, I guess. I'm just hoping some redditor out there can point out the bright side of my situation, because obviously I can't see it.",AskReddit,"I hate my life and want to change things, only I don't see how I can.

Needfreeadvice,1340919094,/r/AskReddit/comments/vrg5r/life_story_inbound_need_help_on_taking_control/,"This is going to be a LONG story, which for me is very emotional, hopefully I tell it good enough for everyone to understand. Made a new account because I've never fully explained my life story or even most of it, to anyone.
So I guess I should start off with my problems growing up. I started missing school around 5th grade, I would stay home maybe once or twice a week every other week. This started increasing throughout the years, in 6th grade I think I missed like, 40 days or something of school. By 7th it was around 100 days and just increasing, 7th grade was also the first time I've ever had an anxiety attack, I completely froze outside the school and couldn't enter the building. Schools didn't take this lightly, I was taken to court IIRC 9~ times, placed on PINS and removed from my home 3 separate times.

First time I was sent to a group home (where I was diagnosed with social anxiety) there was 7 other kids in the house and we always had 2 people watching us / driving us to appointments etc. ""Fortunately"" for me I was placed there in I think may so school was ending soon and it was too late for them to enroll me, they started me on Busbar for my anxiety. After being there for a month I was allowed to go back home, when the school year started I went everyday for first 2 months, then the pattern of missing school started again. I was put on probation for 2 years around this time.
The second time I was removed from the house I was sent to a high security facility for ""bad"" kids, 3 out of the 8 kids there were in gangs, to be fair I was a 14 year old white boy and excuse me for lack of a better word, considered a ""wigger"". I was only there for 8 days, it was a scare tactic by the judge, unfortunately I get along with pretty much all crowds of people when I'm not having anxiety attacks, so I really didn't have anything to fear.

When I got out of that facility I went to school everyday but still had a court hearing, I was happy to show the judge that I was making an effort and was going back to school, unfortunately it was too late. They sent me to a facility with a lot of kids of all ages, for anyone [1] Interested. I was there for 4 months, I had a really good time there, I went to their private school, kids get privileges based on behavior / time there / etc, I got to the highest level before leaving.

While I was in the 3rd facility my parents moved us into a mother-daughter home that my sister bought, so when I returned home I was 20 minutes from all my friends I grew up with from 4 to 16 years old. That year of school I was in a different school district, knew no one etc. First 3 months I went everyday, then the pattern of staying home started again. Before I was going to be kicked out of school my mom decided to sign me out so I at least had the option of going back, 4 months later my mom passed away suddenly from a brain aneurysm. I took over my moms job at the company my sister worked for, being 16 and it being cheaper for them I was paid ""under the table / off the books"".

After that company downsized and pretty much everyone got let go for new / cheaper employees, I was accepted for disability benefits under my dads disability (ankle crushed / almost ripped off by a Hi-Lo.) All the years of being overweight from being home all day with snacks / cartoons, I have a lot of pain in my legs and back. I'm getting closer to what I need advice for I promise, I just need anyone willing to give me advice to understand my situation as best I can describe it.
So I had a therapist and was prescribed Zoloft, I honestly can't put how much zoloft has helped save me into words. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia, I couldn't leave my house without pretty much having an argument with myself in my thoughts, even saying the word anxiety would give me an attack. Due to some BS with medicare and my therapist's license type, they won't cover it, that doesn't bother me as much but we were really progressing.

Anyway, even as much as I'm co-dependent, my 3 elder sisters (15+ years) are either too busy or simply don't want to help me better myself. I've been having to scrounge together what I can to pay for driving lessons every 2 weeks, so I can get my license and hopefully get a desk job and get off disability. My major issue right now is I can't afford to live where I am, long island is, excuse my language, Fucking expensive. My dad lets my sister take advantage of his love for his grandchildren, he is disabled yet she will have him walk to the store for her in pain. He put off having yet another surgery on his ankle for god knows what reason.
I don't hate my sister, I feel bad for how terrible of a person she has become, this household is poison. I want to move but my ""excuses"" are this: My dad doesn't want to be far from his grandchildren, I have 2 cats and a dog, my moms passing left me her car which hasn't been started in 3 years, if I leave now without my license yet I'd have to get rid of it.

I am going for my GED in a few months, I am still 400+ pounds (after losing 75lbs), sadly I let depression derail my progress. My sister covers what she can as far as our half of the bills so I owe her lets say around $2,000. I've explained to my therapist that I wasn't really ""raised"", my mom was always working and my dad was struggling with drugs / depression of his own. I am paying for driving lessons, which I've been told I am instinctively/naturally a good driver by multiple instructors.
I guess I'm just asking what should I do about my living situation? Where can I move that is affordable on disability ($1,700 a month), can disability even be transferred from state to state?
Oh and I forgot to mention my dads been on disability for 20~ years, but he can't get proper ID due to his parents spelling their last name different in canada (where he was born). So his birth certificate doesn't match the name he has been using since his dad brought him to usa (age 5). I couldn't get my permit until after I turned 21 due to mom passing and dad not being ""legal"".

TL:DR Advice on moving with 3 animals, becoming an individual, anxiety took 14 years of my life, fighting to take it back.

Well, as its resolved, I'll tell you. Not very far. Turns out Paul had talked to his mobile manager when we left that night, calling her personal number or some such. The next morning, after two failed attempts with their hotline, I called her. And she told me she would not only honor the deal, but do everything she could do to get the number ported.
What must have been a full days work, Paul called me back, having taken over for his manager when she had to do something else. They had taken car of everything, all we needed to do was stop by and pick my girlfriend's new sim car so we could activate the phone when it came in. The also overnighted it to us.
They put in a herculean effort. I have nothing but good things to say about them.
As to the phone hotline? They'll a bunch of waste of space ass hats that need to be fired or re-trained. Complete. Utterly. Wholly. Eternally.
Interesting note: Turns out the issue was with how ATnT handles the contracts that moved from cingular.

**Original post below**

First, a bit of back story. 

Yesterday, after nearly five weeks of dealing with a very difficult litter of puppies, me and my lovely girlfriend got a chance to go out and deal with some shopping we had been putting off. You know, average kinds of things. She's a teacher, so we needed school supplies, I needed some new slacks for work, as I'm starting a new position, etc. As we are shopping we decided to hop on over to the local Best Buy to take a look at the Nexus S, a phone we were both planning on getting. 

At this point, things are going GREAT. We get to the store, and all they have are fake demos out, which some what dampens my girlfriend's otherwise good mood. So, me being the caring, loving, always prepared boyfriend take out my aging iPhone 3G and try to check the specs, see if there isn't something I can do to brighten her mood. Lo and Behold the Nexus S is on sale today! And for the great price of FREE with a two year contract (we were going to do that anyways).

Thusly did we que up.

Fast-forward an hour. Its finally our turn. The salesclerk, Paul, is doing seven things at once trying to keep every one happy. Later this would become a godsend for us. He takes down our information and tries to put my girlfriend's order through first, as her's is a port from Verizon and will take a little more finger tapping than mine. And he keeps getting errors. After a little sleuthing on our part, we find out that Verizon's servers are down, nothing can be done. So he puts my order through(an update to said aging iPhone 3G) and we try to get her order through as a new line and number, planning on porting her old number to Google Voice when the phones come in. It fails, throwing up an exception he's never seen before. 

Move ahead three hours. We're still at the store, still working with Paul to get my girlfriend the phone she so desperately wants. Her first smartphone, paid for by the long hours she puts in teaching young children Spanish. By this point Verizon's servers are back online, so we try to port her number over again. Paul is starting to get a little tired, having dealt with numerous other customers while still trying to help us. Did I mention he is the only sales person in the Mobile department? Because he is. We get all the way through the interface, helping Paul make sure all the data is correct. He goes to complete the order, and.....

It throws an error. 

Around this moment I get an email from Best Buy. Turns out their systems had borked something with MY order, and it had placed a hold on the account. This meant waiting on hold for an unknown amount of time. Graciously, with an act of what I can only call the greatest of human kindness, Paul waited on hold with us. He reasoned that he could deal with them more easily than we could, resolving the issue and getting us on our way.

Can you guess what's coming next? That's right, another time leap. This one is only an hour. 

Their service department finally picks up. He sorts out the issue. We're back up and running. But we're no long at the top of the list, as there are people picking up phones which have already been ordered and delivered. By now Paul is a close family friend, so we help him out with orders best we can. We our turn comes back around, and the forms are filled out, YET AGAIN, and he goes to complete, it throws a new error. 

Maybe I should start singing now, perhaps a song about time warps. Because the story jumps ahead one last time.  It's been an hour. We've seemingly sorted out his computer errors. But its throwing one last error. Their local warehouse is out of stock at this point, and he's trying to put the order on back-order. All this means for us it that we would be waiting a little longer for the phone. It won't let us. The store has closed by this point. The only people left are us, Pual, another couple dealing with the same issues we are, and one guy having issues activating his Sprint Nexus S. So we try to go through their online website, ordering the phone from national stock. 

Funny thing? If you want to do that, you have to call over the phone. So we let Paul go, dial up the number on my phone, get put on hold, and wait. We wait right on through till the call center closes and puts into a never ending loop. We give up when my phone battery dies sometime around 1:00am. 

So today I call, and try to get them to make things right. And what am I told? ""We're sorry, we can't complete or honor your order right now because it was a one day sale. Have a nice day."" Can't even escalate the call because a Supervisor doesn't come onto the floor until two hours after they open. 

**TL;DR**: Waste Six hours in a Best Buy store waiting for them to sort out their computers systems, then over two hours on the phone only to be told we they won't honor the transaction that started the day before. EDIT: They're saying we now have to pay full price.

My question is this: Does any one know a way I can get Best Buy to honor the transaction that we started the day before, the one that would have resulted in my girlfriend of five years getting her first smart phone, the one which wasted over six hours of our lives, without having the pleasure of paying Best Buy one hundred dollars we can barely afford?

baphomet86,1537626679,/r/socialwork/comments/9i0341/id_like_some_opinionsadvice_about_a_messy/,"Hi everyone. This post is partially just me trying to organize my thoughts about this whole fiasco but I'm hoping to get some opinions/advice about a messy social work situation I've become involved in. So here is my situation:

I am a full time student in my second year of my MSW currently.  But lets rewind some. LAST year, I had my first field placement at a long-term care/rehabilitation facility for older adults. It is a large skilled nursing facility with about 150 residents. I had a great experience there and the social work department was run very smoothly as there were three licensed social workers in the facility at that time (a Director of Social Services, a long-term care social worker, and a short-term care rehab social worker). Things were going well and I even ended up getting a part time job as a receptionist at this facility where I only work every other weekend, which is perfect for my schedule as a student (Still doing this job currently). My field instructor was beyond wonderful. She was the Director of Social Services and had been working in this facility for over 20 years. Well, she announced that she would be retiring once my field placement ended (in May 2018). This would be when shit began to hit the fan.

So, when she announced her retirement I viewed this as an opportunity for myself- the facility was down a social worker, and I needed a summer job- so I asked the administrator of the facility if she would be interested in hiring me for the summer JUST to help out with completing assessments while they work on hiring someone full time and throughout the transition etc etc. She agreed.  Now, the initial agreement was for me to work PART TIME during the summer for 11$ an hour, just so I could help the long-term care social worker (lets call her A).  So I start my summer job. A and I had a great working relationship as we had already become close during my field placement.  Things were a little hectic as A was moving into the Director of Social Services position and trying to hire another full time SW, but things were still going smoothly since I was helping her stay caught up on routine assessments. June rolls around and A has found a candidate for the SW position.  It is at this time when the administrator begins making several budget cuts, firing people left and right for seemingly no reason. One of the people who was fired was the short-term rehab SW.  She was then replaced by someone who is not a licensed social worker, and truthfully has no background in social work! (She was pulled from the business office, I'm not entirely sure what her position was before). Administrator tells A, ""we just can't justify hiring a full time social worker right now, she can only be part-time."" So this was obviously infuriating. Shortly after that, A told me she  found another job and put in her resignation letter. And, understandably, the new SW candidate declined the job offer because she was looking for full time work. 

Great, so at this point I am technically the only social services employee in the long-term care unit. This has some serious ethical implications for me, as a student, with no degree in social work and no license (yet). As you might imagine, I quickly absorbed all of A's responsibilities and was soon doing assessments for the whole long term unit (about 130 people), doing about 15 care plans a week, filing reportables, grievances, dealing with new admissions, discharges, NUMEROUS families with complaints, and not to mention all the other crap that seems to get thrown into the social work department. This went from a part time, light labor job to a full time serious job very quickly. Remember that I am also still working every other weekend here answering phones. I became pretty overwhelmed but I was able to handle it knowing there was an end in sight; I'd already made it clear that I wouldn't be able to work once school started back. 

They finally hire someone to be the new social worker. Let's call her B. B was a brand new MSW graduate fresh out of grad school with absolutely no experience in long-term care, which I thought was an interesting choice given the circumstances.  Once B was hired, the administrator announced during morning meeting that there would be changes to the social services department as it would now be merging with the business office to form more of a ""utilization review"" department.  This is something I'd heard of before but am still not familiar with at all. But oh well, not exactly my problem because at this point it was late July and my last day was August 3rd.  

So the Insurance/financial coordinator (we'll call him C) was the one training B. This made absolutely no sense to me since he has literally no background in social work whatsoever and never really did anything with the social work department aside from helping families apply for medicaid and things like that. I could tell he was not competent enough to show B what she needed to do as far as assessments and care plans and stuff, so I kind of stepped in and helped where I could.  B and I quickly developed a good rapport and she started to confide in me about how uncomfortable and confused she was in this new position. Feeling a little bit bad for her, I told her I would help her stay caught up on assessments whenever I worked on weekends.  I also let the administrator know this. She agreed to increase my weekend pay (only slightly) since I would also be doing some social work tasks. Again, my naivety allowed me to believe I would only be entering in a few missed assessments here and there, nothing major at all.  At first, that was how it was. B was pretty good about getting her assessments done and she would only leave one or two over the weekends for me to do.  

Well, as I'm sure you're expecting, B quit!!!!! Now there are NO social workers in this 170 bed facility, the financial coordinator is technically responsible for social work tasks now, and here I am at my reception desk this morning looking at a HUGE stack of assessments with a sticky note from C requesting that I complete and enter them in the system this weekend.  This is about 2 weeks worth of work, and all of the dates on them indicating they are already way past due. I'm angry, upset, and mainly just concerned that I might be doing something unethical by trying to help the administration play catch-up when what they REALLY need to do is properly staff the facility with competent social workers. I don't mind doing these tasks because it helps me learn as a student and novice social worker, but something about this just feels wrong to me. I definitely feel taken advantage of.  

Any comments and advice would be appreciated.

PoetWarriorLover,1575497052,/r/college/comments/e66su0/27_a_fresh_start_afraid_of_my_potential_or_lack/,"So I'm not old, I'm 27 (28 real soon). But I'm unsure how much potential I have for improvement, what my ceiling is and that has been a big scary unknown since I started my studies at my university.

A bit of a backstory (There will be a TLDR if you want to skip this). 

I had a fairly chaotic childhood. Despite having two loving parents, they had serious demons which I'm somewhat sure were a reason for my public and high school experience. My grade two teacher actually told my mother that I would probably only ever be a C student (Insane to make that call), and I had no real direction or interests that motivated me to try in school. I never did homework, would get zeros on assignments and still passed because I tended to test well. In highschool I was pushed not to pursue university level courses (applied vs academic is what they were referred to here), the academic level courses I took I either failed or scraped by with a 50 due to my motivational problems. When retaking the same course I would usually finish the year with at least an 80-90 with a bit more effort on my part, clearly I wasn't just lacking intelligence...?

&amp;#x200B;

So after high school I worked full-time and fell into a bad crowd for me, an insecure guy without a male role model (a group of testosterone, alcohol fueled bros who wanted to be the biggest thing in my small town) I was beat up one night while drinking with them and after 10 months of solitude (they exiled me for pressing charges) I decided I had to leave my town (I was 22 with no life experience). I moved to Toronto to enroll in a college course I had little interest in, to escape, reinvent myself and because it was the only school that would accept me and my poor academic record. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did pretty well my first year despite some mental health issues, probably due to abandoning all of my comforts at once and moving from a town of 20 thousand to almost 3 million. I entered my second year still battling depression, social and general anxiety and by the time my 3rd semester of the program came to and end I was pretty sure I wouldn't follow through and work in the profession I was studying. At the start of my 4th semester, someone accused me of sexual assault to make their ex jealous (I know, wtf). I was arrested, kicked out of my residence and finished my school year couch hopping until I could rent a room with friends I made in my first year. Even though the charges were dropped, and my record was eventually cleared, my school expelled me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began working retail, got a bit healthier in the head, and after 2 years I became miserable again, I was making money, had a great girlfriend and wide social circle but felt so empty. Video games, and other 21st century vices were just fillers for the parts of me I never explored as a child and adolescent. A friend of mine lent me Crime and Punishment and all of a sudden I was entranced, I had never been a reader apart from books with movie and video game adaptations (Lord of the Rings, Warcraft novels etc.) This type of reading felt different, I read 1984, then I discovered Christopher Hitchens from his ""Four Horsemen"" discussion with Sam Harris, Dan Dennett, and Richard Dawkins, so I read Hitchens books, then Jordan Peterson's... For the first time in my life I felt attached to a respectable ideal, a well read, well spoken person who could form their own opinions and defend them without fear.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a very competitive school here through a mature student program and finished at, or near the top of my class, my professor even told me I have a natural knack for writing (wow something I'm good at, that doesn't embarrass me). I received an academic award/scholarship for the first time in my life as a 27 year old, the ceremony is in February. It's an incredible feeling, but I'm scared that I'm pretending to be something I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at my professors, my TAs, people like Hitchens, Peterson, and I think that these people were put on this path starting in grade school or earlier. They were nurtured, encouraged and pushed until their own individual greatness propelled them further. I'm a late bloomer from a broken home who is trying for something better, but I don't see my potential being anywhere near these people. IQ is a real thing, no matter how hard I work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how extensive and sustainable mental plasticity can be, I've successfully reinvented myself but I don't know if I'll ever be as good as I want and that's kind of terrifying. I have days where I can read and write, and feel happy with it, and there are many days were I can't read an academic sentence with more than two commas and remember the meaning of that sentence. The jump from 1 to 3 classes has been very challenging and while I feel like I'm getting a grip on the learning curve, I just feel like something will give. My motivation and focus, my fears, my finances... et cetera. I know imposter syndrome is a real thing, and that we should never compare ourselves to others but it's something we all struggle with as humans, no?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently set on a philosophy major so I can learn how to think, read and write but it all seems a combination of dry, difficult and very demanding of time. I want to teach as a professor but the alternative plan is to do a double major in psychology as well, and be a clinician so I can help people, like I've been helped over the years. I just don't know if I have the smarts and work ethic to do it, the task seems to be above someone the likes of me and that I'm merely pretending to be smart in an effort to find some sort of passion, or distraction from life. Maybe they are the same thing...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that was a lot to type, I'm sorry for sharing so much. It just kind of flowed out of me. Is there anyone out there who has walked a similar path, or has worked a student in a comparable situation? I feel like I'm the only one with my story, and while it's empowering to think of the obstacles I've overcome, it's also scary to think that I might be fairly alone in my fears...

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for any feedback you choose to provide. My ears are open. Now for that TLDR.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm a 27 year old with a horrible academic history, now struggling to think I'm smart enough to reach my goals of philosophizing, teaching or being a clinical psychologist.",college,"27 - A Fresh Start - Afraid of My Potential, or Lack Thereof",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/e66su0/27_a_fresh_start_afraid_of_my_potential_or_lack/,1575518652.0,imposter syndrome in a competitive highschool,7.96
Lowkey_HatingThis,1519879107,/r/college/comments/812o6a/changing_majors_and_havent_been_going_to_class/,"Okay so this might be a long one, so let me start.

Im currently a student at RIT, in the physics major curriculum. I chose physics as far back as 8th grade, through a combination of reading ""a brief history of space and time"" and religiously watching ""through the worm hole "" I really really was interested in astrophysics. This interest wained over time, and eventually when my high school counselors said ""so are you still interested in astrophysics"" I'd just say yes to get done with the meeting. When I got to high school physics, I hated it. It was boring, uninteresting, and all around just awful. This should have been a warning, but I just thought ""oh this is basic stuff I'll get done with in a year and go to what I really want to do"".

Fast forward to this semester and I'm failing UP 1. I don't go to the class, I hate everything about it. I hate the topics, I hate the people, I hate the atmosphere of the classroom, I hate physics. The other math and science classes (such as chem and calc) I deal with and get and can enjoy sometimes, but physics I just can't stand. I haven't gone to a class in 3 weeks. My academic advisor told me to give career services a call, which I will tomorrow. I'm seriously considering changing majors.

The problem? There are three

1.) I have no idea what I want to do in life. I want to enjoy my career to the point where I never want to retire, but I also want to make decent money (nothing extravagant like a million dollars or something, I don't want to be wickedly rich, if I can get 6 figures, I'd be happy). I cannot think of anything, I've never really had a passion for anything. I was fairly smart in school and really had a passion for learning new things. I was good at the sciences and maths, but I really think I excelled I'm history, it was very enjoyable to me and I was able to pass the APUSH test with a 5 without really studying (I'm not bragging, I did awful on the Calc and Chem AP test, and got a 4 on the English).

2. I don't want to leave my school. I love the area, I'm starting to make friends, I have really nice scholarships and grants, and I am considering rushing a fraternity next year. I commute so the price also reduces from their, and this leads me into my third point

3. Emotionally abusive father. My father, to anyone looking at what he's done for me, would call him a saint. He's paid for my two semesters of college (about $18k so far) and is letting me live with him rent free. He's a very seasoned project manager so he makes about $110k a year, so it's not crippling him financially, but I was raised by my mom and we were dirt poor my early life so that amount of money boggles me and I appreciate it dearly. The downside? He treats me like he's a loan shark rather than a father, and he is an extreme alcoholic of 30 years, destroying his mental state. A typical day, hes drunk by 4 pm to the point where he can barely stand and he shouts everything he says. If I forgot to do something (put dishes in dishwasher, put clothes away, etc) he shouts at me, saying I'm a fuck up or even calling me the n- word (I am 100% white). Whenever i say something to him while he's drunk, he immeadiatly forgets, and when he has to tell me something, he forgets he told me and tells me again 10 minutes later, by 8 pm he's asked me the same question about 6 times, getting angrier each time he ask. He accuses me of lying and being lazy, he accused me of taking his pain meds one time, and I thought he was going to hit me because I swore I didn't take them (I literally said ""I've never taken your pills, why would I take your fucking pain meds""). He's 50 and I honestly think he's showing signs of early dimentia I'm 18 close to 19, an adult who works and goes to college, and it's all very demeaning. If I bring up anything about college (say he asks me about a class, and I say ""it's difficult, I think I'm having problems with it"") he will over exageratingly slam his head into his hands, shake his head back and forth, and Huff very loudly, like I'm 5 years old. He will them ask ""you have any idea how much fucking money I'm spending on this? You better"" and then brings up how I better have a paid internship by my third year because he isn't helping past that point. His attitude and abuse stresses me out to the point where I lie about how I'm doing, and will stay on campus or in my room to avoid him. I can't live on campus (don't have the money, especially if he doesn't pay). I came close to vomiting the other day when I saw my failing grade because I worried what he would say (got all A's last semester except for one D in another physics class and he was very mad, saying I was wasting money). If I change majors, especially to something he might not like, not only would I possibly lose his financial support, but a place to live, a mode of transportation (he let's me drive his car, but I pay for the gas and upkeep) and I might be forced to go to a smaller college back home, which would honestly make me just not want to go to college. 

Adding to this, when I was 10 my mom met my future step dad. He and my father are alike in many ways, he would provide me with cash and things like a good parent would if I earned it or was good. However, he was very emotionally abusive, leading to a weird relationship between us 8 years later. A day would not go by where we wouldn't argue, he would always been my ass about something, and never would geniuenly just talk to me. It got better as I got older, but it's really left me with no real male figure I've been able to look up to in my life. Everyone we've ever been around would say ""he treats that kid like shit"" and even my mother acknowledge that she feels sick to her stomach for letting him treat me the way he did. This leads me to believe I'm not being over dramatic about my biological father 


This whole thing is stressing me out, I hate my major and feel trapped. I don't know what I want to do, and I feel like the only person who would really support me is my mother, but she's not financially well off right now and can only provide moral support. Please help

Please can someone be so kind as to have a quick read through my first draft and let me know what they think. The groom is Tim, bride is Becca and his parents are Ron and Carol just to avoid any confusion. And yes there is going to be a lord present! I've timed myself reading at a slow pace with pauses and its between 5 and 6 minutes. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR below is my best man speech, let me know what you think


Good afternoon my lord, ladies and gentleman.

Now as some of you may know I am not really one for words so when I found out I had to write I speech I asked for help from someone who knows the couple very well.

Pull out cards...

 I must start by saying how lucky Becca is to have found someone like Tim to be her husband. He is so caring, so handsome and so ... so ...

I'm sorry Tim I can't read your handwriting at this point... In fact let's go with the one I've written.

Throw away cards and pull out new ones...

I have been friends with Tim/Staggy/Swaggy for the best part of twenty years and have seen him grow up and develop into the man he is today. I think my earliest memory comes from one of the first times I went to Tim's house. We can't have been older than 9 or 10 and at that age you look to what the bigger people do and want to feel more adult, and we could see nothing more manly than smoking. 

Now the problem with smoking at 10 years old is you obviously don't have access to cigarettes but my good friend Tim had a moment of clarity and genius and decided to roll up a piece of A4 paper, light the end, he blew out the flames and inhaled a big puff of ... well smoke! After a lot of coughing and spluttering, Ron and Carol will be very pleased to hear that Tim was put off trying smoking again for many years! 

It did however start a new fascination, one of fire and all varieties of pyromania, a fascination that I'm led to believe was only extinguished with the assistance of the fire brigade on a couple of occasions!

Our friendship continued to strengthen over more than a decade of school and even continued when we left for university. Tim did make some lofty, new, budding friendships over his university years and I don't know if it was their influence on him or a discovery of his own but he soon learned that he could effectively home learn his subject matter because ""why waste your time going to lectures!"" It clearly didn't hamper things as he graduated with a very respectable 2.1 in Politics. Tim's parents were therefore ever so proud of Tim when he used his degree and i must say their investment to it's fullest potential by beginning a career behind a bar. He made clear steps up the ladder in the bar trade and then made the logical ... um upward progression from there to the cash register of the local off licence.

Now this couldn't really continue and I think there may have been an interjection from Ron at this point for Tim to try his hand at a new career of property development, one that by all accounts was very successful. Now I have a little insider knowledge on the property development as I was lucky enough to assist. As you are no doubt aware there are many costs involved in property development and the aim is to keep these costs to a bare minimum to maximise your profits. Now there is no man around who is better at keeping costs down than my man Tim, we started by landscaping the garden ourselves and I think it was digging away that gave Tim his best plan to date. Why waste money on expensive skips when we could bury all the waste we produced! And I do mean everything! When the lucky first owners of that house decide to do some gardening, and I mean anything deeper than around 6 inches in some places they're going to strike rubble, and brickwork, and if they're lucky enough to find it there's even the old toilet and bathroom sink down there!

Ok so I started this by saying that Becca was very lucky to have a man like Tim and I wasn't lying. He's a tremendous man, a fantastic friend and someone who always manages to land on his feet. I mean let's look at Becca, who I think we will all agree looks absolutely gorgeous today. I think we're all curious how he managed to land someone so special. We do have to be very thankful to Becca for something though. Tim's hair! Over all the years I've known Tim his hair had gotten longer, at it's full length we all assumed it was to do with the lifestyle he was living and the rocker style that matched the way he was dressing. It was also always covered underneath a hat of some style, normally the same well used, rather soiled trucker cap. It was only when we saw Tim in the sea on a day of surfing that we realised he may have been covering for something. As he came out of the water and his hair was slicked back, in a moment reminiscent of Ursulla Andress we were all aghast where it had gone! It appeared that Tim was maybe developing a new form of combover, the rocker coverup! In steps Becca and within not too long we started to see the hats less and less and then suddenly the hair was shortened and well groomed and I think you will all agree with me that it looks much better for it, so for this Becca I thank you!

Seriously though, Becca I've known Tim for many years now, I've seen him at his worst, and I've seen him at his best but I can say truthfully, with my hand on my heart that I have never seen him so happy as I do when I see him with you. In fact I recall a few years ago Tim saying to me one time when he was round at mine and Stef's ""I want what you two have"" Well I can say with absolute certainty that he has more than found love and happiness with Becca. He has an inspiring sense of wellbeing and self assurance when he is with you, which let's me know that this will last forever.

So ladies and gentleman I would like you to all join me in a toast.

To the bride and groom!

manderrx,1586200599,/r/financialaid/comments/fw4yxk/need_some_help_navigating_if_im_completely_out_of/,"Hi all, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but my situation is complicated so I'll do what I can. I'll put it into bullet points so hopefully that will help.

* I'm 29 years old and have been going to college on and off since I graduated high school in 2009. I wanted to take time off before I started college to figure out exactly what I wanted to do. However, I had to attend in order to keep living with my sister so I essentially had no choice but to go.
* I started at a local community college and have gone there on and off since starting. In between those times, I went to various four years schools which were mostly online. I'm one credit away from an associates here but it is a class that can only be taken on campus and I live 2 states away now.
* Pretty much all of my early 20s had been all over the place which lead to issues attending college and doing the work. There were times when I couldn't get to class because I didn't have enough money for gas and nobody to bring me so I had to drop out. I lost my job at one point and had to drop out from one of the online schools during the first week to start my job hunt. I was engaged and when that broke off I had to withdraw again because I had to find somewhere to live and figure out my next steps. I have multiple chronic health issues that would flair up and I ended having to withdraw for certain semesters due to that. I also had untreated and undiagnosed ADHD which only exacerbated things more. There were also times where I would withdraw from online classes and schools entirely because I didn't end up doing well in their classroom structure/it wasn't for me.
* The semesters I was able to finish I was an A-B student who made Deans List one of the terms. I only mention this to show that when things do work out, I can do well and pass my classes.
* During this whole time I was using federal financial aid, there is absolutely no way I could have attended otherwise. Like a moron, I didn't trim my financial aid awards down because I didn't really understand why it would be a problem down the road.
* I can't remember the first time it happened exactly but I was eventually flagged for unusual enrollment history. With hindsight, that makes total sense but at the time I was totally blindsided. I was able to provide explanations for the times I didn't get credit but it was difficult because I didn't have access to any supporting documentation. Thankfully, the school was lenient with me about it and took a statement from someone attesting to what happened.
* Since that first time I've had to drop a few more times and took a decent period of time off afterward to figure everything out. Once I was in a good spot, I attempted to go back last year (2019) and was asked again to do verification. No problem, unfortunately the issues I had don't really have documentation or I have no access to them. How do you document a diagnosis that you didn't have at the time? How do you document a relationship ending? My employer that let me go no longer has on file that I was ever an employee there because they didn't hold on to the record. Basically, I'm in a position where I can't prove anything and it is my word only. The school essentially told me that was the end of the road.
* One of the previous schools won't release an official transcript to me because I owe them money. Even after trying to set up a payment arrangement that would have probably put me in the poorhouse they wouldn't release it. The school mentioned in the previous bullet ended up waiving it for me and took a grade report instead.
* I was still technically enrolled but not attending classes at another school that I did really enjoy but didn't offer my specific major. I chose to go back there to get some transfer courses done and wait things out for the unusual enrollment. Well, after getting myself reinstated with them and going through a SAP appeal from my previous term, I found out I was close to hitting my aggregate student loan cap. Due to this they were reducing my per term financial aid to a point where I was going to need to pay \~$500 out of pocket every 10 weeks in order to attend school for the next year or two. That is not feasible for me so I ended up calling it quits.
* I've since been making payments on my student loans using income driven repayment since September 2019.

After all of the above, I recently decided that I wanted to go back and get my AAPC certification for work. I do like my job doing medical billing &amp; coding but I want to increase my job prospects and possibly be able to work from home which an AAPC certification would let me do. I've found some potential programs that take financial aid and won't require much financial aid because I have transfer credits and this is something that I know about because it's what I do for work everyday.

I'm worried because of the unusual enrollment history flag and inability to get one transcript means I'm SOL on ever going to school again. I looked into scholarships but I'm not sure how they would work with an online school that has rolling 8-10 week terms instead of the usual Fall/Spring set up. My GPA is 2.4 so I'm precluded from about 99% of scholarships anyway. Private loans aren't possible because of credit score, lack of cosigner, and I wouldn't have the money to pay them back monthly while also paying for my federal loans. My employer does offer tuition assistance but I'm required to pay out of pocket up front first. I can't afford to pay up-front and then be reimbursed later on.

I need help and I'm not sure where to get it. I can't get help from a school without applying and I'm not going to waste my time and the admissions department's time if I can't attend in the first place. Is there any agency or person/type of person that can help me navigate this? I've tried myself but there are way too many moving parts for me to understand. I don't know where to turn to get the final answer about my situation.

tl;dr I need helping finding an agency or person to help me navigate financial aid after being flagged for unusual enrollment and inability to get a transcript from one college.

manderrx,1586200599,/r/financialaid/comments/fw4yxk/need_some_help_navigating_if_im_completely_out_of/,"Hi all, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but my situation is complicated so I'll do what I can. I'll put it into bullet points so hopefully that will help.

* I'm 29 years old and have been going to college on and off since I graduated high school in 2009. I wanted to take time off before I started college to figure out exactly what I wanted to do. However, I had to attend in order to keep living with my sister so I essentially had no choice but to go.
* I started at a local community college and have gone there on and off since starting. In between those times, I went to various four years schools which were mostly online. I'm one credit away from an associates here but it is a class that can only be taken on campus and I live 2 states away now.
* Pretty much all of my early 20s had been all over the place which lead to issues attending college and doing the work. There were times when I couldn't get to class because I didn't have enough money for gas and nobody to bring me so I had to drop out. I lost my job at one point and had to drop out from one of the online schools during the first week to start my job hunt. I was engaged and when that broke off I had to withdraw again because I had to find somewhere to live and figure out my next steps. I have multiple chronic health issues that would flair up and I ended having to withdraw for certain semesters due to that. I also had untreated and undiagnosed ADHD which only exacerbated things more. There were also times where I would withdraw from online classes and schools entirely because I didn't end up doing well in their classroom structure/it wasn't for me.
* The semesters I was able to finish I was an A-B student who made Deans List one of the terms. I only mention this to show that when things do work out, I can do well and pass my classes.
* During this whole time I was using federal financial aid, there is absolutely no way I could have attended otherwise. Like a moron, I didn't trim my financial aid awards down because I didn't really understand why it would be a problem down the road.
* I can't remember the first time it happened exactly but I was eventually flagged for unusual enrollment history. With hindsight, that makes total sense but at the time I was totally blindsided. I was able to provide explanations for the times I didn't get credit but it was difficult because I didn't have access to any supporting documentation. Thankfully, the school was lenient with me about it and took a statement from someone attesting to what happened.
* Since that first time I've had to drop a few more times and took a decent period of time off afterward to figure everything out. Once I was in a good spot, I attempted to go back last year (2019) and was asked again to do verification. No problem, unfortunately the issues I had don't really have documentation or I have no access to them. How do you document a diagnosis that you didn't have at the time?

DebtFreeFamilyTree,1626186650,/r/college/comments/ojgs4m/how_much_debt_is_too_much_debt_for_college/,"I wanted to get perspective from students looking towards college, or in the first year or two of college, and share my own. How much debt do you think is too much??? How are you going to determine how much to borrow for college?

OUR STORY/PERSPECTIVE: In short, my wife and I had six figures of student loan debt early when we got married. We got out of debt, but it definitely kicked our butt and slowed down our timeline for life's milestones. Looking back, we wish we would have had someone swoop in and warn us before signing on the dotted line for such significant loans. We are pro education, but realized looking backwards that we could have taken a much better path towards the same degrees. So here is some perspective from someone in their 30s on how much student loan debt is too much...

A FEW MUSINGS ON DEBT:

* Some people might tell you not to worry about student loan amounts because it is good debt, as opposed to credit cards, for example, which is bad debt. The reasoning is typically something like ""it's for education, so any amount is justified"".
* Let me tell you from personal experience paying off six figures of student loans. STUDENT LOANS CAN BE BAD DEBT. Here is why:
   * **You can't sell it.** It's not like most other things you borrow money for (house, business, car, etc). A degree's resale value depreciates to 0.
   * **You can't get rid of it.** You can't get away from this debt. Student loans are guaranteed by the federal government, and the government is not to be messed with. Student loans are *non bankruptable*. Which means even if you get in a really bad spot and declare bankruptcy, this debt still follows you around.
   * **A degree from a ""fancier"" school won't lead to a better income.** You can find some exceptions, but as you look at average income data, it really doesn't make much difference if you go to a fancy school. What makes most of the difference is the type of career you pursue, and your level of excellence. Once you get into the workplace for a few years, nobody cares where you went to school. Do the research and compare average incomes of graduates with your desired degree from your dream school and compare that with graduates with the same degree that took a more affordable path (state school, community college, etc) and you'll notice there is rarely much if any difference.
   * **You won't be saved by the government for free.** The forgiveness programs get lots of attention, but they come at the cost of job flexibility, higher income, and a huge underlying stress that you'll forget to check an administrative box and be disqualified, or that the programs will be changed by some politician in the next 10-25 years, or that the government will simply not make good on its promise.
   * **In summary, whatever you borrow, you will have to pay back.** Ideally in the 5 years after you graduate, 10 max.

I know for some this is not fun to hear and can come off as elitist or classist. That if you don't come from money you can't pursue your dream. I know it can be really tough to feel set back and not be able to graduate from your dream school. Unfortunately, given our current system, this is the reality. If you borrow too much the dream turns into a nightmare. Fortunately, there are ways to get to the dream more affordably. 

SOME RULES OF THUMB:

These rules of thumb are basically rooted in the idea that most folks, once they hit their mid to late 20's or 30's, want to buy homes, start families, start a new business, save for retirement, etc. So in short, you don't want a pile of student loan debt hanging over your head any longer than 5-10 years so you can enter this new phase of life.

* **Rule of Thumb 1:** The **BEST** approach is to find a way to graduate debt free
* **Rule of Thumb 2:** If you are unsure that you wish to have a career, **NEVER** take out student loans
   * If you know developing a career isn't important to you (you might wish to be a stay at home parent, wish to work part time, live an alternative lifestlye, etc)
* **Rule of Thumb 3:** If you must borrow, **NEVER** borrow more than your starting annual salary of your career
   * The reason behind this rule of thumb is that once you borrow more than this amount, it becomes unlikely you'll be able to payoff that debt within 10 years, making it more likely to get in the way of your life in your 30s and 40s
   * Here are some examples of this rule of thumb in action:
      * If you don't know what you want your career to be, assume you'll have an average income of 35k to start your career, don't borrow more than 35k total
      * If you know you want to be a lawyer, and the average lawyer in your specialty makes 100K, don't borrow more than a total of 100K for undergrad and law school combined
      * If you wish to be a family practice doctor and the typical family practice doc makes 150k, don't borrow more than 150k to get through undergrad and medical school combined
      * If you wish to be an anesthesiologist and the average makes 300k, don't borrow more than 300k through undergrad and medical school combined
   * Of course, I'd love for you to borrow less in any circumstance. But if you're planning out your future and that involves borrowing more than one years income, STOP. You are passing a line into a danger zone, and the farther you get past it the more dangerous and suffocating this choice will become.
   * There are some careers that are just ridiculous. Watch out for them. The system is broken, and people ""trust"" that borrowing is just a part of the process and there must be a way to pay it back, because their peers are borrowing lots of money too. Here are careers I've come across that seem to set people up to violate this rule of thumb: Family practice doctors, Chiropractors, Physical Therapists, Non-Corporate lawyers, Teachers with Masters degrees, etc... And guess how these folks tend to feel about borrowing for an education when they reach their 30s? Regretful.

THERE IS STILL HOPE:

That's it for me for now :) Wishing y'all the best as you transition to this exciting stage of life.

PillCosby696969,1661803941,/r/college/comments/x0yjya/what_to_do_about_an_unhelpful_toxic_and_racist/,"I've gone back to school, I was looking into business (but already set for nursing), however there is a few classes left to get my Associate of Business of Administration, so I will take a business class here and there. This just took place in a Introduction to Business class at the local community college. This was the second Zoom lecture, they are optional and occur once a week. I missed the first. He makes us show our faces because better class discussion or something. 

I will say now that I am Hispanic and the professor is not white, I won't specify his race to avoid potentially derailing the conversation. I also said he is not white to avoid derailing the conversation. 

The class opens up in a orthodox and practical manner. ""Any questions about the last chapter?"" When that was done, he started the lecture on Chapter 2. He asked if anyone had done an economics class before (as this is a business class and not a economics class strictly) covers supply and demand, asks students some simple concept questions. So far so good, it has been around fifteen minutes. 

Then he asks students about how they feel about minimum wage increases. Assuming this is just going to be a talking point about certain economic factors or just using a common frame of reference, no red flags waived. Instead he goes on how about they are responsible for the rapid inflation in America history since their introduction and they are the worst thing ever. He links to speeches and documentation and basically spends like half an hour on this point. Now whether you agree or not, this is a vast oversimplification of the issue, but this isn't really what the chapter is about. Anytime he calls on a student to get a viewpoint he strawmans what they say if they disagree or only partially agree. There is a lot of let's say hypothetically and prove me wrong energy and actual verbage going on. 

Now I've been in a lot of classrooms physically or virtually, and usually professors try to extract useful tidbits from student responses or least figure out where their viewpoints might be based on even if they disagree or are technically wrong. But there was a lot of ""So you are saying you are for x (point in extreme), or ""you always act on x for every action"" (principle) in an attempt to point out potential hypocrisy for game.

This is getting annoying, but I am here to just get a better understanding of the profs process to do their assignments (the due dates are wrong on Canvas because of course they are). I just looking at nursing program brochure on my computer while the students are doing what students usually do to an expert in their field, which is sheepishly kowtowing. I get it too, some professors take these personal if you debate them at length, and some professors do not always grade fairly if they take things personal. But we have been on this talking point for longer than the actual lecture and that is the bigger issue at this point in time. The professor is annoying and doesn't like minimum wages okay.

The professor continues with talking about how mininum wage jobs were for teenagers as training jobs, and not meant for careers. Minimum wages and unions have forcibly changed that and now teenagers can't get jobs. Like, okay there has been some experience/credential inflation with jobs but now we are getting into Prager U vibes. Also why are we still taking about this?

And then it did turn into a Prager U video. He says minimum wages have lead to decreased employment of Hispanic and Black youth and thus an increase in crime. He says this decrease Hispanic and Black youths is because employers do not hire them because they come from a culture that does not pass on skills. (Employers are racist). Now this is pretty damning, but maybe he is quoting an argument or something. But then asks the question that he has been asking to support any economic concept i.e., ""If producers can sell a good at higher price for more profit, can you blame them?"" Which leads to the expected answer of no. He asks it again, ""Can you blame them?"". This is horrible, the professor is basically justifying discrimination. I and another student says yes, I let the other student speak. He basically says ""lol just kidding."" The moment passes I am stunned, what is happening this morning, this is an intro business class. I don't check the professor, if you want to call me a coward sure I guess I was a coward. No one else says anything, we move on. 

You might be surprised that I didn't leave at this point. I guess I wanted to see what would happen next. He then moves on to the next topic. No, not in the book. Student loan forgiveness. He asks how a girl feels about it, she lists positive and negatives, he strawmans her and implies she is a selfish person. He goes on a blames the loan situation on silly art majors and another student chimes in to say that the situation is more complicated than that but the professor just insists that majority of the reason for the student loan fiasco are people who took unprofitable majors. A student chimes in to say he is happy to pay for it to help others, and the prof just reduces his argument to just get rich. He literally repeats this to everything the student says following that. He then says that student loans are the best. To which I promptly hit the leave button. It has been fifty minutes at that point, fifteen on actual economic principles. 

Look, I am going to get an A in this class, it isn't too hard even if I don't go to lecture. Most of it is automated access code stuff. And yes, maybe I should have checked the professor for his racist discriminatory views. However, I have never had a professor like this before. My old university had students rate the professors anonymously at the end of the semester and I know for a fact that these had serious effects on the professors. This school does not. Ironically the Zoom session is recorded. So it won't be my word against his. Not just for the racist stuff but for the lack of clarity about due dates on Canvas, the unhelpful, tangential, and mean spirited lecture style This is a state community college. Who do I get into contact with? Will I have anonymity? That's not a dealbreaker. What do I do?

**TLDR: Join optional Zoom class to get information about assignments because prof doesn't have them right on Canvas. Surprise surprise, prof turns out to terrible at their job and views, being racist, ranting, unhelpful, an ass who twists arguments to be right, and an overall shitheel. Asking how to report this effectively.**",college,"What to do about an unhelpful, toxic and racist professor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x0yjya/what_to_do_about_an_unhelpful_toxic_and_racist/,1661825541.0,can't pay for school,7.82
Wildjay7931,1649567301,/r/college/comments/u0an03/taking_a_year_break_from_school_your_opinion/,"I'm a student at a university. On my second year. Going for two degrees. One a degree in creative writing, the other a degree in biology. All with a minor in Outdoor Adventure.

This is the final term of my second year at my university, but basically my first (because of Covid and other factors). Also, I'm 26. It took me 6 years at my community college to finally figure out what I wanted to do and get accepted to a university. And, despite my previous 6 years at a Community College, intellectual, I'm not much better than when I graduated highschool.

So, six years at a Community College, two years at my university, and still basically a freshman...

Now, I have always loved school. And still do, but I feel way overloaded at the moment. Not just with school, but personal life aspects too.
I have ADHD, which has always affected me in school (in some good ways actually, depending on the topic), I also have brain damage from when I was 16 which basically wiped my memory clean and I have had to relearn almost everything. And that by itself has been trouble. But, even worse, really the worst aspect of all I think, is a social anxiety disorder I gained as a consequence of my memory loss.
Basically, I was embarrassed of not knowing elementary things in highschool that I learned to lie and pretend I knew. Which made it so much harder for me to relearn since everyone thought I already knew. And my fear of others judging my hidden lack of knowledge made me more and more anxious to a point where I am now with a social anxiety disorder. And with my lack of relearned knowledge it makes many of my classes more difficult. Now, I'm actually a quick learner, but with the anxiety around judgment and how far behind I am intellectually, all coupled with my ADHD, I feel I am learning almost nothing in my courses. Putting me farther and farther behind.

Along with all this my family is currently going through some tough times too. And my distance from them and inability to help is heavy too.

And I'm confident, if I was to take a year off school, I would be able to catch up with the information I have missed.

I have the material and text from all my courses along with recordings many of my professors actually post to YouTube of their lectures and classes. And without the angst of time and judgment of others I could easily study over this year break and be closer to, if not at the level of the other students. And with the fear of judgment of my intellect being my greatest influence for my anxiety, I would be much more comfortable in class with the knowledge I missed.
Hell, I may even be confident!

I would also have time to get more help with my mental and some of my physical health which had fallen behind too, thanks to my anxious waist of time.

But...

Their are of course consequences if I do take a break

For one, if I take a year break, then that means it will take me an entire nother year to gain my degrees.

Also, at the moment I am noteably dependent on my financial aid. It covers a majority of my living expenses.
I do work, but at the moment I'm only doing Doordash to help a little during the school year and cover me over my summer breaks. I've had a few other regular jobs, but my anxiety has caused me for one reason or another to quick or lose them.
Doordash is the only one so far that I feel comfortable doing. Hell, I actually enjoy in a little. And with my low living expenses, I could likely get by with Doordash for a year (I did the math, haha), but I'm still nervous of it though.

Also, at my university, I actually found a program that helps students like me with similar disabilities. I have a coach I meet with each week who greatly helps me out. Honestly the only person I have met yet in my two years at my university that I am comfortable, even enjoy, interacting with. Closest thing to a friend I've had in years. And taking a years break, I wouldn't have that. Plus the help the program gives me not only with school, but life outside of school too.

And finally, one more thing that makes me terrified of taking a year break... Making a friend...

It sounds odd for a 26 year old man to say this, but making a friend is honestly my biggest goal at the moment. While I have social anxiety disorder, it has lessened on the past year or so, and I have made it a goal of mine to make a friend. Because, well, I'm lonely as fuck. I mean, my family lives in another state as do all my old friends from way back when. I have made it a goal of mine to make a friend.

And school is the best place for that. For me, there's not many other options outside of school at the moment really for me to make friends. I'm hold no religious affiliation, I don't drink or smoke (hate the idea of lacking sobriety), I'm more so an introvert, I hate parties. I don't follow sports. School is really my best option to meet people I can connect with at the moment. And damn, I'm depressedly lonely. I wantva friend.

Now, I know the option of just taking one or two classes, and I would go with that option but I'm in an odd situation with my university.
I'm an out of state student, but I'm in a program where I get in state tuition as long as I am a full time student. And the out of state tuition is so noteably higher that just two credits with out of state tuition would cost me nearly the same as me getting in state tuition as a full time student.
And I am not rich. My family can't help me out (they would if they could but my families broke). And with my low income I am unable to pull a student loan without a cosigner. And I have no family with goodenough credit and/or income to cosign with me.
So, with school tuition, I rely on being a full time student or else, ironically, I couldn't afford it.

Oh, also, I'm fearful that if I take a break, like so many others unfortunately, I may not return. Which is an awful thought seeing as all my life goals rely on me going to school, and school honestly being one of my favorite places.

Anyway...

Given my awkward, long worded situation what is your opinion?

My head's going 50/50 right now. Any opinion on either option, or others, is welcome.

For context this was at San Jose State University in California.

I desperately need help finding a solution to my problem, and please if you can help it don't just say give up and go to a community college (I realize that is an option but I really don't want that)

Anyway, at the beginning of my semester (Fall 2010) I ran into a shit ton of problems that lead to me not getting my classes right off the bat. I had to run around an impacted school as a Freshman with basically no knowledge of the school or college in general, with no resources I knew about at the time and tried for nearly two weeks to have teachers give me add codes to enroll in their class. 

I managed to get 3 classes and was extremely stressed out this whole time because I ran into an outrageous number of No's and it was very disheartening. I was also living in the dorms at this time and had the housing department on my ass about paying my fee's (which I couldn't pay unless my financial aid was distributed, which is only possible IF you are enrolled...see the problem?) I was BARELY able to even end up adding all those classes late, which means getting the heads of the departments to sign your late adds along with the teachers and an adviser for each class.

I only had 9 units so I ended up having to take out a loan and that mixed with all of the other shit I just dealt with stressed me out a bit, on top of which I was now 2 weeks behind my classes and didn't know anybody at school :/. 

Sorry for this backstory but it wasn't like I just was an asshole and fucked up for no reason..yes it's still my fault, but it could have gone better.

Anyway I ran into more issues..(groups hated me because I came into them late and they didn't want me getting credit) So I failed a huge project..on top of which I got mugged -.-..didn't make any new friends :/..just everything was shit. I ended up succumbing to my depression which had already been bad prior to the school year starting and just fell off the deep end and stopped eating or leaving my room or doing anything normal..I just slept and did nothing really..it is embarrassing for me to admit but it's the truth unfortunately.

Obviously this led to me failing all of my classes, I was put on academic probation and had to do things for that..which makes sense obviously. So as I am considering my options...I go to the Housing office and talk to the person in charge of everything...and I tell her that I want to break my housing contract and take a leave of absence because I do not believe that I am mentally or emotionally ready to do another semester of school after the last one had gone. She tells me she will not break my contract because too many people are breaking them already and they will not allow it. I didn't know much about shit at the time so I probably could have petitioned it or SOMETHING but I was already in the worst mindset possible and thought that was all I could do :/.

So basically I was stuck with my housing contract which is expensive as hell...and the only way to pay for it was to enroll in classes to get financial aid to pay for it..which I wasn't ready for at all. In addition to this, failing my classes led to me having issues signing up for classes with holds put on my account and whatnot because I had to do some advising sessions and shit first. So I get to start this second semester in a terrible condition AND have to run around and add classes all over again..I end up actually getting 12 units and my financial aid. 

I try really hard to do well this semester but I still had no friends and my suitemate had actually moved out (we didn't share a room) because he said it was like the place was empty (which I completely understand but it still made me feel shittier) I just really wasn't ready at all for this, I end up passing 3 classes that all of the teachers were aware of my last semester and kept in touch via e-mail and I had some office sessions and whatnot that helped me immensely and were basically the only reason I got through. However the fourth teacher completely ignored me and refused to help me, did not have office hours, did not even have a phone number to reach her at and never responded to my e-mails. This led to me having a huge amount of anxiety towards that class and just a feeling that I wasn't good enough..so I would literally go to class half the time..and just turn the fuck around because I couldn't deal with it. 

ALSO: I did see a doctor and I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depression and I DID tell the housing lady this and she said she didn't care/it didn't change anything.

Anyway..I got Disqualified because I did not get a 2.0 the semester I was on probation and now I'm out of school. I met with a ton of people at the school and they constantly led me to believe that I would be able to reverse it because of the extenuating circumstances that It was a health reason and because the school acted improperly in not letting me break my housing contract when they should have. This has been going on for a year and I have been getting more and more depressed because it always sounds like I'm going to get back in...and then I get rejected again...and honestly I don't think i can handle it anymore, I don't know what to do so I'm here for ideas I guess..or to vent at least? 

I know I could go to a community college but regardless it shouldn't be okay that a school fucked me over like that, I don't want to just give up and make it seem like it's perfectly fine that they can just mess with you at no cost to them.

TLDR; I would really appreciate if you read it if you think you could help..but basically I got super depressed, failed classes, wanted to take a leave of absence and wasn't allowed and now I'm disqualified and it sucks.

Is there anything I can do legally? or...anything really?

JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help! 

Edit: Should probably mention that less than 10 colleges in my state offer Music Ed, and they're all at least two hours away, and none of my family leaves near any of them.

f0sters5,1523489981,/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,"Hey guys. This might be a long story so I apologize, and thank you, in advance.

Anyway starting in high school, neither of my parents ever went to school, and neither really believed in it. I was never pushed to do good in school, and never encouraged to pursue higher education. Just before I graduated, the two of them had a very long, drawn out and dramatic divorce. I had just gotten out of a relationship where I had been cheated on. I stopped caring about anything and lost myself in mindless things like video games.

I bounced around from pointless minimum wage job to the next, while also bouncing between parental households as they each kicked me out repeatedly, seeing me as a failure who would never amount to anything. I began to believe they were right.

Eventually I met another girlfriend, and got a decent paying job netting me about 20$ an hour. I was still unhappy, but things felt like they were starting to look up. Until I realized this was just another dead-end job in a warehouse that I was miserable breaking my back at everyday, and even that girlfriend ended up having cheated on me for over a year of our 2 year relationship. I went into a slight depression, stopped working hard at work, and lost that job because of it. Being a dumb 20 year old at the time making that sort of money, I got a credit card thinking it would help build my credit; and it did - until I lost that job and could never pay it back. Now I'm pretty sure my credit is abysmal and I'll never be able to buy a new car let alone a house.

After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere.

Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out.

I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with.

During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there.

Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all.

I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

So here I sit, lost, depressed, in debt with no degree and no foreseeable future that I can see lining up for myself because of my past mistakes and failures. I really need advice from anyone who can offer it. I finally found something in life I'm honestly 100% passionate about, and am so afraid its too late and that I've messed my life up beyond repair - please help me find how I can achieve my dream despite all the things I've done wrong in my life.",college,"Trying to get my life together at 26, and fear I might have messed it up too much already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,1523511581.0,can't pay for school,7.753333333333333

After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere.

Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out.

I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with.

During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there.

Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all.

I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

So here I sit, lost, depressed, in debt with no degree and no foreseeable future that I can see lining up for myself because of my past mistakes and failures. I really need advice from anyone who can offer it. I finally found something in life I'm honestly 100% passionate about, and am so afraid its too late and that I've messed my life up beyond repair - please help me find how I can achieve my dream despite all the things I've done wrong in my life.",college,"Trying to get my life together at 26, and fear I might have messed it up too much already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,1523511581.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,7.753333333333333
BananaWorkz,1342309816,/r/AskReddit/comments/wkjis/my_family_members_have_low_iq_trying_not_to_be/,"I've noticed it since I was very young, and I'm trying not to be rude about it, nor do I want to seem like one of those immature people that whine about their parents' intelligence. I think it might actually be some sort of medical condition that's just gone unchecked for quite some time.

Here's the thing: **they can't take care of themselves** most of the time and it's starting to worry me. For the most part, it has always been like this. Now that I am paying my own bills, I simply don't have the financial resources to take care of them. They have *always* been slow, but as they age I feel it's getting worse. They haven't been diagnosed with anything. 

Stuff that's been constant in the 25 years of my life:

* My dad can't spell simple three-letter-words, and it took him until I was in high-school to spell my name correctly. He can only write his name correctly and two-letter-words. He seems to be semi-illiterate but has a high-school education.

* He and my mother have had their identities stolen on separate occasions, and my father has had a woman take advantage of him and steal $10,000. It happens every couple years. My brother and I usually have to bail them out of it. They also fall for pyramid scams and ""get rich quick"" schemes. It seems endless.

* My mother, father and maternal grandmother do not understand sarcasm, or jokes. If I turn on comedy central, instead of laughing at a non-offensive joke, they get frustrated and angry and repeatedly ask why they are being stupid.

* If I talk to them and give them a new piece of information about my life, they will forget it and ask me about details over and over. (For example, I'm going to get a used car from a relative in December. They keep calling me obsessively every day asking if I'm going to get it today or maybe this week, even though they know for a fact that it's still July. When I tell them that the guy won't give it to me until December they get frustrated and act like they don't understand why he won't give it to me *now.* It doesn't seem to be a memory issue, though I have had to re-explain when I am getting the car and under what circumstances about ten times already.) 

* They don't understand the concept of money, billing for services and the value of things. Dad told me that he was willing to pay for my *entire* college education when I graduated high-school and wrote me a check for $1,000. It turns out, he thought that's what an entire four-year education costs. When I gave him the correct information, he threw a tantrum, got physically violent and refused to pay for anything. He told me I was too stupid for school anyway, and should get a job at wal-mart. He also refused to co-sign for student loans or give me tax information for a FAFSA, and kicked me off of his health-insurance plan because he convinced himself that the government would make him pay all of my bills, forever. 

When I was younger, he had kicked me off his health insurance a few times before because I ended up in the hospital with pneumonia (I had an IV because it was at the point where I couldn't swallow) and he told me that the hospital and I were plotting against him to waste his money because they charged him for water.

* On the money note, my mother and grandmother will spend most of their money on their hobbies or impulse buys and they will not have any reasonable amount of food in the house for weeks until the next payday. I went weeks just eating at school because I had nothing at home. We had to declare bankruptcy a number of times.

Stuff that is new:

* Dad is becoming very clumsy and seriously injures himself doing ridiculous things. He has nearly cut off his hand building something in the basement, overdosed on his blood-pressure medication (fainted and hit his head) and overdosed on several different medications because he can't figure out dosages. I have to leave my phone on the charger at all times in case I get a call from the hospital again. 

* Grandma can't take care of her pets. She lets them get infested with fleas/get gravely ill/overfeeds them to the point where she has no choice but to put them down. Either that, or somebody has to call her and remind her to buy them some medicine. I have been calling her daily to try to get her to buy flea medicine for four months, and I have offered to pay but she keeps putting it off. Her last dog died about 6 months after she decided she should probably put it down and she waited until the poor thing was leaking mysterious fluids out of the bottom of it's chest and stomach. Most shockingly, she told me that it wasn't a problem and she'd just wipe it up. It had been going on for quite some time. She told me ""If she had been in pain, she would be crying."" 

* Dad and Grandma have changed political identities for no reason even though it's not in their best interest and they have donated money they can't afford to spend. My best guess they have been watching a lot of Fox News/CNN and can't differentiate what is being spinned and what is actual information. 

* Dad has suddenly gotten incredibly racist even though several members of my family (my husband for example) are minorities. He also has several friends of just about every race. The racism just developed almost overnight. He no longer has a filter around my young nephews. He recently started screaming at some black kids while he was driving in the ghetto and I'm pretty afraid he's going to get himself hurt. 

My mother isn't actually so bad in comparison, but she and her four siblings can't deal with grandma alone. My brother and I can't take care of our parents either. I was thinking it might be dementia or something, but they have been low-functioning since I have known them. It *is* getting worse though.

What can I do, and what exactly is going on?

Does anybody have any similar experiences?  What should I be expecting in the future?

*Edit:* Obviously I'm not saying that they are mentally retarded, nor am I making fun of the mentally handicapped. They just have always had issues with reasoning and taking care of themselves and my friends have made comments about it in the past, so I'm just not the only person seeing it. My husband refuses to go over and visit because he says it's ""depressing."" It's a very big problem.

katparry,1508795503,/r/college/comments/78b680/existential_crisis_in_progress_messy/,"Hello /r/college, I've been a lurker on here for quite some time. I'm about to dump a lot of stuff on you:


&amp;nbsp;

Background:

&amp;nbsp;

Longer story shorter, I'm 28 and in CC. I worked for 10 wonderful years in project management at a Fortune 50 company (making very good money with no degree), and was doing very well in my beloved career, but alas my husband got a job in D.C. and thus we moved. Instead of going back into the workforce I decided it was time to get my degree, something that I've wanted since I was young. Its something that I personally want to do to prove to myself that I can do because I tried to go to college once before and it was a massive failure (tl;dr really chaotic homelife, poor af, and stress made it really hard. Also I was not ready) so I went into the workforce instead. I was encouraged by a professor (that I took philosophy classes from while I was working full time) to continue to pursue academia... and he was right...I love school, I love learning, I'm a sponge, and I'm doing super well here. I'm very happy in school, and I dont ultimately regret my decision, but i is at the same time ruining my life because of the lack of ""knowns"".

&amp;nbsp;

Issue 1: Picking a Major

&amp;nbsp;

I can't seem to pick a major between Anthropology, Sociology, and .....Photography (photojournalism to be precise). In regards am not looking to get a ""job"" out of my degree because I am purely going to school to learn. I am a firm believer that the process of getting the liberal arts degree has great value, not to mention I have learned more in the three semesters of CC than I did during all of my other school years combined. I can only imagine what its going to be like to get deep into a major program and learn more.

&amp;nbsp;

I love photography because it takes me to new places and I'm good at it. It gives me satisfaction (when I like my own work), and It challenges me to always change my perspective. I love cultural anthropology because I love learning about a culture, food, the rituals, relationships, the politics, language. I love traveling and getting people's stories on their lives, their families, and so I usually pair my photography with a photo essay when I go. This is something that I've been doing since I was very little.  I love sociology because it involves systems and theory, which is where my mind loves to play. I also love philosophy and political science for the same reasons. It is a pure joy for my mind when I'm in these classes, I feel like I'm lifted out a deep dark hole of my depression and awestruck by the amazingness (or awfulness) of the human race whenever I get back from a good lecture. 

&amp;nbsp;

The issue I'm having is how do you discern between ""beloved hobby/subject"" and buckle down to ""undergrad major"". 

&amp;nbsp;


Issue 2: Picking a Transfer Institution

&amp;nbsp;

Its transfer season, so all of this seems to be weighing so heavily on my mind. I'll have three semesters under my belt, and four by the time I get into whatever institution I do get in to. My issue is that I have family members that are telling me that I shouldn't go to universities like Georgetown or GWU if I get in because its going to cost a lot of money...I'm really pining to go to those schools because of the curriculum and the teachers. I've been to the campus, Ive sat in on the classes. They are amazing schools. The family members I'm staying with think that me going to school without the solid idea of ""getting a job"" out of it is inconceivable. These are people who went straight from HS to Ivy League schools and had the money to pay for it. They had ideas that they wanted to be lawyers and teachers and whatnot since they were young, an apparently no one in this group has ever struggled with the ultimate life question ""what should I do with my time"". For the first time in my life I'm regretting being unconventional. I feel like a newborn baby deer learning to walk. Going to work after highschool was easy. I tried to avoid all this by giving up college, and this time I want to see it through.

&amp;nbsp;


So its getting to me. I feel strongly that it shoudln't matter that I don't *know* what I want to do on the job front because I'm going to get a job after. I'm highly employable. What the job is, where it is, I do not know, but I already feel that my time in college is opening me up to so many more possibilities. Values are very important to me, and the job that I have later after school will absolutely reflect my values and leverage the skillsets that I have built from my previous employment. I would not give a moment of my precious life-time to something that doesn't matter to me. I'm not worried about the future job prospects, I know I'm going to make it work.... but I am worried about the debt that school is going to pile on top of me. And if I'm going to be in debt, I want to make sure that I got a damn good education. So if I can ditch these feelings, and try and grow a thicker skin to shield myself from family members, I feel like I can largely ignore #2 and just worry about picking a major and picking how much debt I want. 

&amp;nbsp;


I currently have a 4.0 GPA and in a greek thing that opens up opportunities for me....also another honors program at my school that is AMAZING. (I've learned so much from honors classes!)  I've been getting good scholarships based on my merit at CC already, so I'm hoping that I would continue to get scholarships at whatever institution I get to attend. But I won't know what these financial aid packages look like until I get them. So I'll just have to wait for that. 

&amp;nbsp;


Conclusion: 
So I guess I'm just half-venting, half-asking if I'm nuts. Should I just bail on school and go back into the workforce, the thing that I'm good at? Am I ruining my life? What should I pick as a major? Does it really even matter for undergrad? Is it so bad that I just want to go to school to get a well-rounded liberal arts education? Should I just ignore these people or does my idealism need to be crushed with an iron fist?

Thank you.**

I'm on the verge of my 20th birthday, currently in school in Chicago studying something I'm only honestly mildly interested in. I chose this path because in high school, I convinced myself I wasn't good at anything but the extra curricular I was doing after school, which was working tech crew for the theatre department, so now I'm in school studying to be a set designer. Honestly, theatre is not for me. I don't really enjoy plays and musicals like my peers, I can't rattle off lists of my favorites and I don't sing showtunes, the persona of actors and directors disgusts me, and I don't know how to read a script and put the idea on a stage. I don't think these are things I want to deal with in my life. That's a shitty career plan.

But I went and convinced myself that I was going to be a set designer and that I was going to love it, so that's what I focused on and I thought it was going to be great, but as I've been in school the past year and a half (I'm a sophomore now), I realize I don't think this is right for me.
Honestly, I think I want to be a tattoo artist. I've got the artistic talent, I could just use to better my skills. That, in itself, could be an option to just switch my major since I'm already in an art school, change from a theatre design major to a fine arts major, develop my skills, then go out for a tattoo apprenticeship. That sounds like it might be a solid plan.

The major issue is, I don't want to be in Chicago anymore. For a lot of reasons. I'm from here, and staying here to go to school was not my first choice. In fact, it was worst case scenario, and here I am. I wanted to go to school in Seattle since high school. A school there was my top choice (albeit for the same major I'm studying now in Chicago) and I was accepted with flying colors, but my parents ultimately made the decision for me to stay at home. I'm an only child and I guess they were selfish and wanted to keep me around as long as possible.
During my miserable freshman year of college, I made the effort to apply transfer to the school in Seattle, who reaccepted me basically on the spot. I felt like I was really going to go and live my dream, and then I let insignificant things stand in my way and keep me from going.

This past fall semester, school was going fine for me after choosing to stay in Chicago. I thought, alright, this is how it will be, maybe I'll choose to move after I've graduated. But recently, my personal life took a huge turn for the worst. I, foolishly, thought I had gotten myself involved in a potentially serious relationship over the past year, and was suddenly told differently when he decided I wasn't what he was looking for, and he didn't love me, despite stringing me along for nearly a year. This was very, very recent, and I'm still reeling from this situation, which is honestly really devastating for me. I just feel like I can't even be around him anymore. I don't want him in my life and I don't want to go to the same school as him, I don't want to be in the same city as him, I want to be as far away from him as possible. I wish I'd never even met him but because that's not humanly an option, the next best thing is dropping my entire life and leaving. Part of me always wanted to, but now I feel like the flame has really been lit. This was my last straw. There is absolutely no way I can ever be happy here. I need to make myself happy somewhere else.

Part of me just wants to drop out and move and not even bother trying to transfer schools and rack up more student debt. Tattoo apprenticeships are not cheap, and do not count as educational institutions, so I would have to save money or take out a private loan.

I fear disappointing my family by leaving school and moving away. My dad's family is very old school and would not really approve of what I'd be doing. But I have to think about how much that matters to me, because it's important that I make myself happy while I'm still young enough to do it. I feel like I'd be disappointing my faculty advisor, who is the professor for the majority of my classes relating to my major. She sees a lot of potential in me and I don't want to disappoint her, although I'm sure she'd rather see me succeed at something that makes me happy than to continue pretending to do something that doesn't. I'm also not the most important or groundbreaking student she's ever seen. It wouldn't be that big of a deal for her. She's not new to this.
I also fear I'd be making a huge, huge mistake if I go and can't find a job, hate school (if I end up transferring), or not be able to even find a tattoo artist to take me in as an apprentice. I'm not sure how to lay these things out and decide which is most important to me.

Adding to that, I was selected to go on a trip to Prague during this upcoming summer with other students in my department to attend a quadrennial exhibition on theatrical design. I was so excited, it sounded like the experience of a lifetime, but now I'm feeling I don't want to continue in the program, which would make the trip obsolete and a missed opportunity, but if I do go and decide after to not keep going with school, it would be a waste of my time and money, and someone who deserved more than I to go on the trip would get my spot.

I feel like I should continue out the semester, but that's another $5,000 in student loans plus interest I have to pay back on a degree I don't even know if I want. I thought I had everything figured out, and now everything is upside down. I'm not even sure how to start figuring it out. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents.

TL;DR: I think I want to drop out or transfer but fear the repercussions it might have.

Being totally honest here if my tuition wasn't paid for by Bright Futures I wouldn't have even bothered with this bullshit. Florida education is only good for one thing... getting a job in Florida.

When I was applying to Uni's I was pretty much told ""I ain't paying for shit"" by my single mother, so I ended up going to a shitty commuter school 40 min away from my house. She refuses to file the FAFSA cause she's kind of fucking crazy (still love her tho). Going in I had no clue wtf I wanted to do, ended up changing majors 4 times, starting with Computer Science to Biology to Psychology to Business Analytics and finally settling on Management Information Systems. Going onto my 4th year with 12 classes left which I'll probably finish in 2 more years (5 years total in college) cause that's how long my scholarship'll be good for + it's easier, don't really care that much since I'll still be graduating at 22. 

Point is I fucking hate it here, I don't spend much time on campus because 

* A. I just wanna go home or somewhere else, after class I always feel like I've spent too much time there 
* B. It's a shitty Florida University that doesn't even have a football team (Every single U.S. University pumps most of their budget into their Sports teams. Considering that this is a Florida university we're talking about that speaks volumes about the quality of education I'm receiving) 
* C. I've always felt like I could've gone somewhere better If I went into more debt. Would've been a stupid idea considering how much I think College is a scam but ik it would've made a more enjoyable college experience.

Cause of my lack of campus involvement and a good amount of virtual classes (cause why waste gas driving 40 min to and back) I've pretty much made 0 friends here. I still hang out with homies from HS and some other peeps, but I literally have no incentive to go out of my way to talk to people. The clubs are also shit too, not much variety.  Also doesn't help that I see a lot of people I went to Highschool with, kinda makes the experience feel even more lame. The worst part is not only do these fucking vampires force most people into debt, they make us VOLUNTEER on top of it. Imagine being someone that takes out $6000+ in loans a year for bullshit along with working a job to pay rent, to be forced to do over 100 hours of volunteer work like you're still in highschool. The real kicker here is that you're not even guaranteed a job once you graduate, only 50% of graduates are employed. That just shows how much the boomers have leeched our opportunities, only 13% of those old retards went to college and they made more money in their prime than Millenial and Gen Z combined. This shit should be free. Paid for by the tax money that goes to the Military industrial Complex and Israel instead of the American People. If you don't support free college you could say the same shit about Highschool, which BTW a College degree now is the same thing a Highschool degree was back in the 60's and 70's (back when it cost almost nothing). Too bad we live in an Oligarchy where politicians would rather give tax cuts to their corporate donors instead of giving us Healthcare.

Now you may be wondering ""Why aren't you taking advantage of campus networking?"" Well because I honestly don't give two shits about my education. My reason for going to college was 50% parental pressure (Angry Cuban Father (who died when I was 12) was a dentist with an Ivy League degree and my mom has a bachelors in Bus. administration) and the other 50% me thinking It'd be stupid to skip out on the 100% free tuition I got for getting a 30 on my ACT. 

Were it up to me I would've majored in History. I'd actually feel engaged with what I'm learning + my biggest strength has always been writing. Why didn't I do that? Waste of a scholarship. There's two types of degrees: Degrees that force you into becoming a k-12 teacher or ""Job Training"" degrees that can get you a decent paying job (Engineering + Business). That being said I actually like learning about the Business world a lot, the information system aspect not so much. But the Truth is I don't see myself making a career out of this degree at all. Fuck graduate school too as Sam Hyde once said ""Thats the loser route"", a massively expensive time waster. I've always hated school, why tf would I want more of it? I'd just wanna make money at that point.

I believe in this life we either follow our dreams or we live out our lifespan. Working as a Systems Engineer sounds fucking boring. If I'm still having to write job applications in my mid 30's that's a big sign I didn't work hard enough on my goals when I had youth. The 9-5 is Creative Suicide, fuck real jobs (btw before any of you call me lazy I worked retail from Sophomore to Junior year on top of taking 12 credits per semester, I HATED that shit XD ). In an ideal world I'm some famous Hideo Kojima guy who's created a badass IP with comics, video games, anime, tabletop rpg's, etc. (We'll have to see how that turns out lol) 

I'll probably work a job or two given by my degree (has to at least be 70k salary), until I have enough money to start working on my actual dreams. Who knows if Florida's the right place for that though, opportunities and getting the right people to work with is all location dependent. 

Bottomline is I think I've wasted a good 3 years of my life, going on 4.5 to 5 in the near future. College is what you make of it, and personally I haven't made jack shit. Why? Cause it really wasn't for me.  Also let's be real here EVERY single thing you learn in college could be learned online or through books, even better if you find the right person who can teach you the skills necessary to follow your dreams. MENTORS &gt; COLLEGE. A burden will be lifted off my shoulders once I graduate, I'll probably have more time for personal endeavors. Hopefully whatever job my degree gives me doesn't completely suck that away from me.

If that is not the case here is a quick summary: My name is Thayer Tompkins and I'm a sophomore Zoology major at The Ohio State University. I have had an incredible passion for animals (really any critter, bugs included) for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I always said I wanted to be a vet, when I was even younger I said I wanted to a bumble bee when I grew up but that's a different story entirely . Anyway, for some years now it has been my dream to go to Africa and work with the wildlife there one-on-one. I want to be able to know more about them, interact with them, and mostly stop all these beautiful creatures from being wiped off the face of the Earth.

I never thought this dream would actually be a reality until very recently. A few weeks ago I went to a seminar for a volunteer program called ISV, which I will explain soon, (sorry this is soooo long, thank you for reading this far!) Anyhooo, the program that they introduced me to was in South Africa at a cheetah rehabilitation program where I would be working hands on with cheetahs and various other animals. Now I'll skip ahead to the important part of this event and leave more information about the programs lower/in links.

So since this is an opportunity of a lifetime I wasn't going to let it pass me by so I applied for the program, was accepted, and put down my deposit for the trip. Woooo Exciting!! I KNOW! BUT WAIT, you're probably asking yourself ""Thayer don't you have college to pay for? Aren't you piling up debt from loans? Is this free?"" The answer to those are yes, yes and unfortunately no. This program is for THIS summer so it's coming up soon. I would be leaving MAY 10 but I have to have my money in by March 10. All together this trip is going to cost me $8000. So I'm essentially trying to raise $8000 in 4 months. I know it seems naive or even foolish but I will not let this slip through my hands

This is where you wonderful people come in, I need help to get the finances in order. I'm asking for people to help me raise this money with donations. I have a pay pal account set up that is strictly for this trip and nothing else. If you want you can simply donate to my account all you need is my e-mail address. I'm going to try and sell bracelets also. If you've seen my wrists lately they are covered with them so why not spread the love right? I'll put pictures up soon of the bracelets that i've made and can make and I'd be more than willing to make you bracelets in exchange for a donation. You can even go to the ISV website (which i'll link in the bottom) and donate specifically to me. All you have to do is click MAKE PAYMENT and then there will be a scrolly thing that says payment type and you can click SPECIFIC STUDENT DONATION and then just puts mys name in it. Honestly, I'm willing to do almost anything for this trip. Need your room cleaned? Need laundry done? Need help moving? Got good credit, bad credit, no credit? Well I'm the girl for you! For realz though pretty much anything but sexual favors I am willing to offer to get donations.

Now I know people get these invites all the time (and i'm sure they're not even this long) and they just close them and ignore it. I know cause I do that literally all the time. And I know that a lot of people are in the position I'm in, just struggling to get through school and pay bills, believe me I understand that. I'm not asking for a required donation, heck if you're still reading this that's pretty damn amazing. What i'm asking is if you can give $1 that's awesome, if you can give more that's awesome! If you can't give anything, you're awesome too, all I ask is that you pass this message along to friends or family members that can help me. I already plan on reaching out to businesses to see if they'll sponsor me and if you guys know of anything specific that could or would help just leave a comment and that is more than enough of a donation.

I'm sorry if this seems weird or stupid or awkward cause maybe we dont know each other that well or we do but we dont want to but here's what I say to you. If you're my friend and you care help me achieve this dream, if you don't like me help pay to get me off this continent, if you're indifferent you've probably stopped reading by know so, yeah. High five for expressing yourself!

Hokay well this is a mile long and looks intimidating to me so i'm sorry for all of you who have to read this but I truly appreciate any help anyone can give. You're all wonderful people

throwaway_036,1505191383,/r/college/comments/6zktf9/i_came_to_the_terrible_realization_last_night/,"I've always had a bit of difficulty making friends. I've always been the ""quiet kid"" who never talks or the one who doesn't make eye contact, is very shy/introverted etc. In high school I had a small group of ""friends"" who were also a bit nerdy or whatever, but at times I didn't really feel like i was actually their friend. I never did anything with them outside of school even though they sometimes made plans w/o me, and I only sometimes participated in their conversations, etc. So I felt like I was the weird kid of the weird kids, but I thought maybe I was just being pessimistic.

So now let's fast forward to college (where I currently am as a sophomore). Even though I should have an easier time making friends since there's way more like-minded people here , I was still struggling. There were a few people (like 5-10) who you could call friends, but again I never really hung out with them outside of class, and after first semester was over and I got new classes, those friends dissipated and I got new ""friends"".

However, one friend I made first semester seemed to be more of a friend to me than anyone else (let's call her K, the first letter of her real name). I say this because every time she saw me she'd shout ""HI THROWAWAY_036!"" and seemed really happy to see me. She was part of a friend circle I had first semester where I'd have class and then go to lunch afterwards. She seemed to get me to participate in the conversations with my other friends and really seemed to care. So if I had to label someone as being my best friend it would probably have to be her. Furthermore, even during second semester when she wasn't in any of my classes, we'd see each other in the dining hall and we'd find each other and sit with each other. Then we'd talk for a bit, and somehow I was never nervous or socially awkward around her. I never ran out out things to talk about. I even considered that maybe I should ask her out or something, but I never did and after what happened last night I laugh at that thought.

So that was freshman year. At the beginning of Sophomore year (a couple weeks ago), I run into K outside my dorm and she says ""OMG THROWAWAY_036!!!"" or something like that and never in my life was someone so happy to see me. So she says we should hang out and I agree and I say I'll just text her. So I end up doing that, but she never responds. I see her in the dining hall a couple days later and mention that I texted her and she just goes ""ohh....uh yeah my phone broke"" in an odd voice but says that she'll text me and then we can hang out, so I say okay. But over the next week, she doesn't do that. Instead, I text her again AND facebook message her (we're friends on facebook and she regularly uses the site and the messanger app), but still no response from either medium (except she did say ""heyy got ur text this time"" but when I immediately asked her afterwards about plans so hang out she says nothing). So I see her a third time in person and say I texted her again and she has a similar response but she just says she's been busy, which is completely understandable (and true by the way; she's taking 21 credits and doing 20 hours of research a week and she's in 3-5 clubs and she's an RA).

That brings us to last night: I she her again for the dining hall and she says hi. I ask to sit with her since I had no one to sit with. She was sitting with another friend and just hesitates and says ""well.....not now since I'm having a private convo about some boy drama with [name of girl she's with]"". Odd response because I thought she trusted me and was her friend but I convinced them to let me sit with them. So I ask her how her weekend was and she says it was okay and that she went out with a bunch of friends, and that another friend came down from a nearby university. At this point I was confused because she hung out with so many people this weekend but she ignored me? If this wasn't enough the friend she was sitting with asked to get together and hang out with her right under my nose and she magically found a spot for her on her busy schedule, which was on her magically fixed phone. She was also texting other friends the whole time so yeah...her phone was not broken. And she never mentioned ANYTHING about wanting to hang out even after she mentioned how much she hung out with friends last weekend and says that ""all she wants to do is hang out with friends"" (but never mentions me). To top it off, she drops this on me: she says she's visiting New York next weekend, Phoenix another weekend, and Austin TX another weekend...during the semester, just on the weekend. I ask her how she does this (obviously how she has the time and money) but she just stares at me blankly and shy's ""uhhh...you just go?"" as if anyone can afford to do that.

At this point I felt physically ill, as if I was about to pass out, cry, or both. It was a negative emotion which was some odd combination of confusion, betrayal, denial, loneliness, and depression all at once. It was so obvious after this conversation that she doesn't view me as a real friend. She really wanted to hang out with me, but couldn't even though she made plans right under my nose and casually mentioned multiple friends coming over (and when she said her ""friends"" it was clear I was not a member of that set...)? At this point I realized that not only was she not my friend, no one was. There's those people who talk and pretend to be interested in me like her but then they end up hanging out with their real friends and not me, which is exactly why I've never made any formal plans with my ""friends"" my whole life. those kids back in high school? Not my friends. It's so obvious now. I remember them all talking about their stuff that they did together outside of school without me but I just always brushed it off.
So yeah, it sucks to come to this realization. Sorry I have to post this here because I can't tell anyone is real life since I have no friends.",college,I came to the terrible realization last night that I've never made a friend in college (or in life),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6zktf9/i_came_to_the_terrible_realization_last_night/,1505212983.0,i can't afford a dorm,7.613333333333333
DarkDubzs,1442700118,/r/college/comments/3llwkg/borrow_money_from_sister_keep_buying_myself_time/,"So I am in crushed between a rock and a hard place, I have such a sinking feeling of despair right now, I feel like I just want to disappear forever. Well, this is the situation:  
I am a college sophomore, last year I fucked up big time failing a few classes. I knew I was doing horrible, but I didn't think I would have to pay for it like this, not to this magnitude of stress and shit. Man, I wish I could just go back in time and beat the shit out of myself for being a fucking idiot loser. Anyways, this first semester of my second year (it's week 5 now), I've lose financial aid, and have only $180 in my bank account. I have gotten myself into such a web of lies to protect myself and fool my parents, mostly my dad. I have to pay $100 a month on the 15th for a care credit loan for a past surgery, but I can choose to not do payments and I can pay however much more in the future. I also have to pay $30 for my phone bill around the same time to my dad. I also need to come up with $80 to pay for a book I need for math. 

So, I have told my parents that I have $3000 in financial aid money in a different bank account that ""the school made and deposited it into."" Now my dad wants me to withdraw about $500 to my normal bank account since I only have $180 right now. He was trying to get me to do it today, but I may be able to do it tomorrow. This is where I'm at right now and I feel like I'm finally cornered and everything is unraveling, falling apart. I obviously don't have $500 to withdraw. I don't have a job yet, I've been trying, but nobody calla back, so today I'm applying a lot and going to hope I luck out soon. I have an appointment with a therapist on campus on Monday to explain how I was mentally last year when I fucked up so hopefully he can write a letter explaining this since I need proof to back up my explanation for my financial aid petition form and letter. So if all goes well, I may get a couple or few thousand in financial aid again on about October 10th when the next financial aid disbursement is. 

So my options are: 

1.) Ask my older sister who lives in the house for about $300 to borrow so I can deposit it to my bank account and ""buy off"" my dad so he is appeased and sees I have done this and that I ""really have"" the financial aid money. With this option, I would pay back my sister when I get a job soon or if I get my financial aid back in October. If I only get a job, I would stop ""withdrawing money from the other account (that I lied about)"" and tell my dad I want to keep it there and I'll pay what I need to with the money from my job. Bad thing about this is it's weird and my sister would know how bad of a position I'm in. 

2.) Desperately try to buy more time until I get a job or hopefully get my financial aid again. What I would do is pretend to get mad and say how my dad is always trying to control everything and that I would pay what I need to and he needs to just leave me alone with my finances already because school is already stressing me out. I already have been acting more depressed and they believe I'm stressed from school, I am, but the stress is coming mostly from this whole situation that I've been lying myself through for weeks. I am banking that I'll have a job by the time I need to pay my phone bill next month on the 15th or hopefully even get my financial aid right before my phone and loan payment are due. If not, I can still pay the phone since I have $180 to myself right now and the loan payments are flexible so I don't have to pay next month without a penalty. 

3.) I finally cut all the webs and come clean. This is the hardest option for me to pick and I honestly don't know if I can at all. My parents, especially my dad, will go insane on me, I probably deserve all they'll do to me, but I'm trying to do what I can to avoid this option. What would happen is I tell my parents that I have fucked up giganticlly. I would tell them how I failed a few classes last year from being depressed and stressed out, which I really was, and because of that, I had my financial aid money taken away and have lost eligibility for this semester, and that I know I need a job and am really trying, which I do and am. I would also say how I might get my financial aid back once I talk to a therapist and explain how I was last year when I did so poorly, and when they can write a letter to support my appeal. I don't know what my parents would do, they're not really ones to do this but I really believe they would get physical with me or lose all hope for me or something catastrophic. First of all, because of how much I have lied to get through this and fool them to save myself so far, and because of how I did poorly and fucked up to get to this low of a point. I can't believe I've done this to myself. I don't know how I would look at them the same after this. This is the absolute last option for me that I would have to resort to. 

I really don't know what to do. I wish this was all just over and I was never in this to begin with, but the only thing keeping me going is that this can all be over soon when I get a job and HOPEFULLY get my financial aid again. I have very much definitely learned my lesson. I never will let myself to this to myself again at all. I already am doing well in school with a strong effort to not do the same. 

Sorry for this massive post, but the backstory and my situation is very dense and just fucked up. Please, please, I need help choosing what to do. Time is running out for me.

ea0995,1607995762,/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,"Hi All,  
I am now 2 years removed from graduating college and I just wanted to let any 17-18 year olds looking for colleges things to consider  that I wish I could've thought about when I was your age. 

1.) Don't take out loans for the college experience / its okay to go close to home - 

Im not saying loans are bad. You should take out the loans you need for school, I emphasize 'for school'. I lived about 15 minutes away from a really good college with a highly recognized Engineering school, instead I went to an out of state school about an hour away that is just as recognized in Engineering as the in-state school. I enjoyed my time at the out of state school, but I ended up with about 30k in loans (which isnt that bad) while friends I had in the in-state school escaped with about 15k in loans. I would've probably gotten the same job at the same pay regardless of either school I would've gone to, so I could've saved 15k.  Most of the loans were just to live on campus and get the college experience because I didn't want to be so close to home. Trust me, a social life is not worth the loans if you can get a similar social life elsewhere for the same education. If you have a chance to go to Harvard for example, or your local state school, then that's different. Really assess your options if that is the case and see what's best for you. 

2.) Take out a credit card - 

You should ask your parents about building credit now. Have them take out a credit card in your name and let them use it for gas and pay it off every month. Or have them add you as an alternate user to a credit card they rarely use. That is if you think your parents will be responsible enough, there are also horror stories of parents messing up their kids credit. If not then take it out on your own but only use it once a month and spend like 50 bucks and pay it off by the end of the month. Your student loans will give you credit history but if you plan to pay those off quickly then it gets erased from your credit score once its paid off. Im not 100% sure but I think your credit score could go down for paying off your oldest account (its stupid, but that is the way it works). If you have a credit card as old as your oldest student loan, then your credit score won't be affected as much because your credit history is based off your oldest active account. My oldest accounts are my student loans and I didn't get another account till I graduated. So if I pay off my student loans early my history will drop 4 years. Even if you don't use the credit card you should never let credit cards close, because the more money you have in credit cards (the max amount in the credit card) and the less you use the higher your score gets. It's always good to use less than 10% of the credit card, keep it below 5% just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) apply to scholarships even throughout your years in college -   
Scholarships are still given out even if you have been in college for years. Don't stop applying just because you are already in college. Colleges tend to have programs where alumni donate a certain amount to be used as a scholarship. There are scholarships for people online. If you can avoid getting more loans, you should do it. 

4.) you can start at a community college -  
community college doesnt get the credit it deserves. My parents/uncles/aunts saw it as an embarrasment to have me or my cousins go to a community college. If you want to save money and you think you can still graduate in 4 years assuming you get good grades, then go for community college for you first year to get general eds out the way. Check if there is a community college that works closely with a state university to transfer credits easily, usually if you get good grades you can get all your credits transferred if the CC and university have a good transfer program. If you only got accepted to one school but the school is too expensive or they are not giving you enough financial aid, go to community college for a semester or two, get your grades up and you can transfer to a 4 year school even if they rejected you in high school. It's easier to transfer to a school if you have good grades than it is to apply out of college. I get it's not the easy way out but it can save you a ton of money.

5.) College isn't for everyone / there are other options -  
this is for kids who may be in school because of their parents and may not like being in school. This does not apply to me but I do have relatives who went to school only because their parents slammed it into their heads and they didn't dare to tell their parents they didn't want to go. I also knew a few kids who went for the same reason and ended up dropping out. The relatives who didn't want to go stayed for at most a year and have student loans that they never wanted. Trade school (plumbing, electricity, etc) gets disrespected nowadays because nobody wants their kid to be a plumber. Even though you may have to work harder to make good money, there will always be a need for plumbing and other trades. There's no shame in it if you really work hard. You can even get in to real estate or maybe if you're really street smart and dedicated you can work hard at investing in stocks or real estate. It may take years and alot of luck for you to get good money in houses/stocks but it's been done before. Assuming you put in the necessary work. It's not easy and will take alot of learning and failing and you may never get good money but at least you tried. I wish me and my relatives knew of these different options, I would probably had still gone to school still but maybe my relatives would have gotten a good certificate and gotten better jobs. We were basically told its school or working at a factory. You can also sign up for the military if you like it and decide to go to school after your contract is up, which they pay.",college,Things for high school seniors to consider.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,1608017362.0,school is too expensive,7.533333333333333
SavingsCow,1521656876,/r/college/comments/864h81/do_you_think_i_should_transfer/,"I am a second-semsester freshman at a world-class university. 
I'm proud to be here, but I don't know if I'm happy to be here. I'm not sure if I'm unhappy with the university or if it's a mental health thing.

Long post, so here is the tl;dr:
**TL;DR: I'm not sure if my motivations and goals fit in with those of my school. I feel like I'm breaking my back and headed nowhere. It's like I'm headed in circles. I don't know if it is a personal issue, a personal issue that is being made worse by my school, or my school.

I’m just tired of culture, having to worry about beating the curve and studying all the time. Another thing about the school is that it is so “no days off”. You can take a day off, but you’ll have to work your ass off to get back. It’s like you have to pay to just take a Saturday off with friends. And I would like to spend every Saturday doing some volunteer thing. I can't even enjoy spring break because I feel like I'm wasting my time not studying. You can’t even take a day off to enjoy your hobbies. I’d like to go hiking and even camping in the state park but god knows I don’t have time for that. It’s like my life is on pause. I know college is about academics—I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be. It’s just I can’t with a good mind take a day off and relax. I dislike my school's atmosphere of competition, grades over everything (even well being), and a bad grade = you didn’t study / you aren’t intelligent. Other students agree that there is a stressful, highly academics-focused culture at the school.

 I like that my school has interesting classes and passionate students. I just can’t help but feel different from the students here. I feel like a dumbass here. I don’t know if my ideas are/motivation is appreciated. I want to be somewhere that I have time to volunteer and do extracurriculars and develop my hobbies and have a job or internship. I realize there are people at my school who are able to successfully juggle the academics and manage to have an internship and hobbies, but I don’t know if I’m one of those people. So far that would be impossible for me. I am so stress sensitive. I freeze up and I feel stupid and like I won’t amount to anything when I’m stressed. And it seems like this school and the students here run off of it. How much time and emotional energy I’m putting into a light workload (14 credits) of comparatively easy classes, I just don’t know if being very involved in volunteering and having a job or internship is possible for me at this school.

Internships and jobs are essential to future job prospects. My alright grades and the school's name won’t be enough to get me a job after graduation. They don’t show whether or not I am competent in the real world or a job environment.

I don’t want to be some big-name, famous, world-class whatever like many of the students here. That just doesn't motivate me. I feel disconnected from my peers in that way. I want to be a mom, be involved in my community and things I feel are meaningful, and be a teacher or a counselor or maybe a psychologist or something like that. I want to help people. I don’t care about notoriety or working for a Fortune 500 company or having my own Wikipedia page or making six figures. I wonder if I’m breaking my back working towards other people’s dreams and the dreams my parents have for me. I’m giving up things I enjoy, like improving and exploring my hobbies and interests and involving myself in causes that I find meaningful. I wonder if that’s even necessary. I want to do extracurriculars that let me work with kids, environmental things with the Bay or the state parks, clubs advocating for and interacting with people experiencing homelessness. I extract so much of my drive and internal sense of meaning from volunteering and involving myself in causes and I don’t have time for that. So far I've had no time for volunteering or anything of the sort because I've either been busy with work or trying to relax myself. I’m also not sure that my internal drive aligns with that of my school. 

In addition, this and last semester I have beens struggling with my mental health. Disassociation, stress, anxiety, racing thoughts, shaming myself as a lazy, useless buffoon who can't even get out of bed, do a calculus problem, or function like a normal person (In addition, people here tend to act like doing poorly in a class is because you're less intelligent). Some days I would be sitting at lunch with friends and almost break down into tears. Some days I wouldn't go to any of my classes but instead lay in bed, cry, and feel like I wasn't even a real person. Basically every week I have a day that this happens and I freak out about school. I'm very stress sensitive. In high school, I did not have perfect mental health but I am not sure if what I am experiencing now is related to the school or what. I want to do well and succeed. I don't want to breeze by and have everything given to me. I worry that people are chalking up my issues these past two semesters to laziness.

I’m not saying any of this just out of concern for my grades or my mentality, but everything as a whole. I know other freshman here who have struggles some but are doing beautifully. I don’t know why it isn’t clicking for me, but I don’t have four years to decide whether or not it is working. I should also explain that last semester I took one credit under the required amount. Because of this, this semester I am on academic probation. If my grades are not up to par, I will be removed from the university and have one semester to prove I deserve to be here. I am speaking to my advisor, friends, RA, etc. about this, I just want as much input as I can get. Thank you all so much.

PullOutBoy,1322801129,/r/AskReddit/comments/mx56m/ive_been_crying_all_night_reddit_i_dont_know_what/,"Long story short. Me and my gf (ex?) are fighting. and before I continue on with this story I just wanna get some backstory. I'm gonna be completely and brutally honest so I can get the best advice possible.


Essentially my gf goes to work/school and her time is occupied what seems full time and we spend minimal time together. Her mom is sick (cancer) and she spends time with her too. I'm more then understanding of this and give her her space, but she has told me literally that she has no time for friends or barely time for me. I understand and am patient and will see her when I see her.


Now fast forward to last night. Last night it was her birthday and I recently found out she's been going out drinking with her friends. She says it was once, but I can't be too sure. I stormed out in a fit of rage on the dinner because my leg was shaking and I didn't want to make a fool of myself, cause a fight, or upset anyone.




I told her if she has no time for anything, why is she doing that? I don't care how much time you got, I'll savor every minute if it means being with you and I don't care what it is. She doesn't understand this and thinks I'm just being a jealous prick. I just wanna see her man, but whatever she doesn't get why I got upset.




So then I back to meet her at a club with her friends and the rest of the night goes smoothly. Then today hits. Boy was she pissed.




She got mad att me because my gift wasn't thoughtful and in the past I bought my ex a guitar and guitar lessons. (Long story short, I was a magician making decent money and I had no bills/rent/car insurnece etc etc to pay thusly I was able to afford these things). Mind you this was 2-3 years ago... anyway. I'm a home owner, pay taxes, every bill imaginable, gotta support my mom's tired horse shit and can only spend so much. I also drive an expensive luxury vehicle which costs a shit ton to maintain. So you're probably thinking ""Oh well you got all this stuff, clearly you can afford to buy her nice things"". I can and I will, but last  year in October I went to jail for something I didn't do. I had to shell out 10 grand that pretty much got me out of jail (I was working for the senator in my state and couldn't afford to stay in jail, I was threatened to be left in jail for a month) and for my defense which got me off, but fuck was it shitty and heart breaking to go through. Also I grew up very poor and used to be one of those bad kids who roamed the streets. My dad was a dead beat and now that I've saved all this money and had/have good jobs i don't like to just blow it like its nothing, but my gf doesn't understand this at all.


I bought her a 120 dollar gift card, but it wasn't thoughtful to her. She doesn't really have hobbies, isn't into art or music, doesn't like science type shit or like techy/geek stuff so I had no idea what to get her. So I figured a gift card where she likes to shop would be ideal!


nope, not good enough, I'm a selfish cunt who only cares about myself. She also like weird Broadway shit.... but I ain't gonna buy her music. She likes glee shit, but I imagine she has most glee stuff so clothes it was!! it made sense!! but my gift wasn't thoughtful.


she also went on to say that all her girlfriends get gifts all the time from their boyfriends and I replied ""well I'm sorry I'm not them! I don't live with mommy and daddy and I got my own shit to worry about/recover from"".



It gets worse. I know a club promoter out here and he's been out of town taking care of his grandmother and spending the holidays with his loved ones. I asked him to help get my girlfriend  a table at a club, but he couldn't do it. But this man has pulled through for me and my mates from europe all the fucking time and I did not hold it against him one bit that he couldn't  do this one favor for me. My gf on the other hand went on to say ""you go out all the time and get 1000 dollar tables, get bottles etc etc but you couldn't do this one thing for me"". I went on to explain that my friend isn't around to pamper me like he always does I'm sorry I can't live up to your expectations also those ""$1000 dollar tables"" were provided by my friends from out of town, they paid fore everything out of pocket and we didn't bother dealing with the night life goons to do it..... I also didn't get her a birthday card. I think they're stupid and a waste. I end up throwing all mine away (is this wrong?) and I just didn't think she'd want one, my hand writing is shit anyway and it'd seem cheesy as fuck so I just did away with it, but once again she complained.




I feel super shitty and super hurt. She fucking crushed my heart man. Saying my gift wasn't thoughtful and shit, saying I'm not like her friend's boyfriends, calling me selfish, making me feel like scum!




what should I do reddit? I turn to your collective wisdom to cheer me up/make me feel better.



I think I'm a decent guy, I do good by my works, help others, work an honest job and pay taxes. I treat my gf very well and I always defend her/put her before others. Am I suppose to be showering her with gifts all the time? I always thought just being honest, caring, loyal, and just generally being supportive all the time is what it took to be in a functioning relationship, but I haven't been in a relationship in a long time.



I'm a slut man. I used to go out banging tons of girls, threesomes, orgies, crazy one night stands and then I settled down with this amazing cute girl who honestly gave me the impression she was super cool and down to earth until today.

spoonspoon,1315954811,/r/AskReddit/comments/keq6d/should_i_pursue_a_doctor_for_an_adderall/,"Alright. A friend of mine gave me adderall to test it out and study with. I took it, expecting to feel super-focused and charged up for studying... but instead, I feel *normal.*

Let me explain. Normally, my mind is full of racing thoughts and constantly feels noisy and all over the place. I usually feel pretty antsy and/or stressed to some degree, and I experience a lot of social anxiety. Recently I've also noticed more lapses in memory than normal.

This all has increased dramatically since entering college. And I thought about it- all through elementary, middle, and high school, I was also constantly thinking, thinking, thinking, and I would channel all of my nervous energy into drawing. During class, instead of fidgeting and letting my concentration go all over the place, I would constantly draw. All day, every day. During every single class and every single lesson, I would doodle and create elaborate drawings. Otherwise I would get very antsy. I had to be constantly drawing' either that or I would be creating little objects out of my school supplies and everything became an elaborate story in my imagination. When I'd get home from school, I'd run around the run and holler and sing and I couldn't help but leap around everywhere I went. 

Then, when I graduated high school and went to college, I suddenly had no time to draw in class anymore. The occasional doodle, sure, but otherwise it was notes notes notes. This is fine except by the end of every class I was very very restless. So restless that I'd be exhausted. It sounds weird, but it's true. *sitting* made me exhausted. Still true. Nowadays, I'm constantly battling my mind for control of thoughts, and I can't sit still or else I begin feeling really stressed and anxious. And, like I said, my mind is constantly noisy. 10 thoughts at once, all of the time. They're usually conflicting thoughts, too. ""I should do my essay. No, I should do my math. Maybe my essay will take longer. What's the history of the microchip? Oh my god I forgot to ask off that day of work. I wonder what Lauren is doing. I should do my math homework. What's the history of calculus?""

I also have a lot of social anxiety- I'll lose track of what people are saying, too, which doesn't help. Mix those negative emotions in with my noisy mind and I'm constantly a stressed out mess. I've tried to meditate- I sit down and immediately I think of 10 other things I need to do, then I'll wonder whether meditation works, then I'll try to actually concentrate, then I'll get a headache from frustration. Doesn't help that I often suspect it's worthless and I'm just tricking myself.


But anyway. Today, I took adderall and then slowly began feeling more relaxed, and my mind went quiet. QUIET. I can think one thought at a time! I can even multitask(it's a totally unrelated habit that I need to break. common problem for many many people and has little to do with actual disorders), and while switching between tasks I can go back to the previous task (i.e. a calculus problem) and pick up where I left off. Usually if I try multitasking, it just spirals out of control and I lose sight of anything important I was intending to do. It's because my thoughts go too fast, I think. Now I'm multitasking, but each task I switch between gets my full attention.

I know adderall affects normal people in different ways, like some people get shaky and SUPER focused, but I just feel normal. Like, really normal. Not high, not ridiculously focused, not abnormally single-minded. I'm still distracted as ever because that is a discipline issue in every sense of the term, but I dunno... it's hard to describe. I'm comfortable in my own mind for the first time in what feels like years. It probably has been years. I can *think.* I can think about what I want to, in depth, and my head is not buzzed with 20 layers of thoughs and emotions smashing together all at the same time. That's how I usually feel... 

I dunno. Should I look into getting a prescription (it'll be expensive for an appointment; no insurance), or am I perfectly normal (if undisciplined) and adderall is just doing what it does to normal people? Do people always have racy thoughts and incredibly restless tendencies, or do I actually have a problem that medication would help with?

It's just that I level of peace and quiet I'm experiencing right now is astounding and I want to have this mental clarity all of the time. I've been high before and that doesn't even match how good I feel right now, where my thoughts are one at a time. I mean, even if I'm thinking of a few things at once(like at this moment I also have some calculus problems floating around in my mind, plus the thought that I should get ready to leave for my study group), those multiple thoughts seem ordered and calm. I've still let myself get distracted to come to reddit and ask this, which is totally my fault, but... does anyone understand what I'm trying to describe?

also, my friend said his dosage is a little higher than average. Still, I just feel *normal.*


tl;dr My mind is constantly screaming, but I just tried a dosage of adderall and I feel normal and calm for once. Not necessarily super-focused, but just peacefully able to concentrate. I still have discipline issues like any lazy college student (read: I snuck onto reddit in the middle of solving a calculus problem b/c I let myself get distracted), but I just feel so calm and collected for once. I feel comfortable in my own mind for the first time in years. It's so unbelievably refreshing. Is this normal, or is it worth pursuing a prescription? Should I just write it off as a placebo affect, or is my brain experiencing a legitimate chemical affect that made me calm down, and gave me clarity?


sorry if even the tl;dr is really long. I'm just so astounded by how quiet my mind is, and how I feel like I can concentrate if I really want to, but I'm not so drugged up that I'm obsessed with something. If I could feel like this on a daily basis I bet I'd be much happier overall.

StabilizedDarkkyo,1516679448,/r/college/comments/7sbp4z/is_there_still_hope_for_me_to_attend_college_long/,"I have attended three semesters of college as a degree-seeking student. I didn't fuss about it, but near the end of the semester, my family got an eviction notice that freaked me out like crazy, as my step-dad wasn't paying rent and was misusing our money. I was already struggling as these last few years of my life have been insane, but we were able to survive. Around that time my Mom and step-dad started their separation/divorce. It left me frazzled at the end of the semester, and I ended up getting an A, C, and D. Not terrible, but I got an academic warning. I told myself it was just me being lazy, and that the next semester I would do better.

Then, spring semester of 2017 came and life got insane again, even more so this time. My grandfather committed suicide by shooting himself in the face during spring break, my step-father attempted suicide multiple times from the beginning to end of the semester, my brother got put into inpatient treatment for suicidal activity, and we realized how screwed over we were financially from my stepdad's misuse of our money. Things became tight financially, so I continued my student job I started the first semester of school, but I noticed my performance had dropped significantly from the previous semester, both in school and work. I got an academic probation, seeing that my GPA dropped under a 2.0 to a 1.66. But I was able to get an airline ticket as a prize in a lottery at work, so I thought I'd be able to relax by seeing my father and his side of the family down in Michigan. Heck, the next semester would be great if I came back relaxed! So I booked a trip right before the fall semester started.

During summer, my stepfather overdosed on Ambien twice, strangled himself with a belt to passing out and tried suffocating himself with a bag. Finally, he was told to move out after he was hospitalized. This constant calling of 911 and being afraid there would be a dead body in our house kept everybody in the house on edge. Everybody was stressed, anxious, and terrified. Thankfully I was able to stay at another house for a couple days here and there when I needed to, but the stress still got to me. Then, during the trip to see my father, it turned out that he wasn't what we thought he was. I had brought my brother with me, and two days before we left, my father started verbally assaulting my brother over how he'd die if he were ever to be robbed, how my mother raised him wrong, how he would have raised us to be good christian children, how he wanted to take my little brother and force him to stay there. My father mocked him for having an online girlfriend, telling him he should be screwing every girl possible, told him that he was a pussy that needed to learn how to kill, and so forth. I hid in a room trying to stay away from the fight, but my stepmom dragged me out and started screaming at me at how i had told my mom that she was abusing my little brother, how I was totally conspiring against her when I was only 11. We later went to go on a boat ride, but on the way my step father screamed at us for being non-religious, that he was ashamed of us bieng his blood, that I was a pussy-footing failure, that neither of us woudl get anywhere in life, and finally that we better not tell our mother, as telling our mother would get him pissed off, and he told us that everybody that pisses him off would no longer exist on earth. So basically he threatened to kill us. So on the boat, my little brother called my mom while I kept a look out, and the next day our relatives in the town kept us away from our father as much as they could without raising suspicion. Then, past security at the airport we met up with my mother, where our father couldn't see, and went home. We were scarred from that, and we went to school full of stress and fright. I went to the counseling center at the university after breaking down when trying to tell my teacher what was wrong with me, but they said I was a bit too extreme to me and referred me to the psychological counseling center, who didn't accept me as I wasn't suicidal. So, I went to my former childhood therapist. My brother ended up dropping out. I got academically disqualified. 

I for some odd reason thought there was still hope that I could go to school this semester, but I wasn't able to. Turned out they removed me from the degree program, so I tried as a non-degree seeking student. Turns out that as a non-degree seeking student, I had no access to any of the loans or student aid I heavily relied upon, as my family has been spending pretty much every cent on the financial mess we were left in. I called the financial aid center and tried to see what I could do, and they said my only option was to go to class and pay out of pocket or go get a SAP appeal done. So, I emailed my academic counselor about it. This morning I got an email saying that I was pretty much removed from the university. The SAP appeal was only allowed for degree-seeking students, but seeing as how I became non-degree seeking a few days prior, I was disqualified from that. 

I have no financial way to go to college without begging for money from my father or getting a job, which would interfere with university especially since I can't even drive yet. So, I'll have to take the next semester or two off to raise up money to go to college, but my loans only give me a grace period of six months, so I am afraid I won't have enough money to go to classes before that is up. Is there anything I can do to still go to college, or do I have to just drop out for the semester and work until I can afford it again?

zephyraaa,1545288366,/r/college/comments/a7vaj9/is_it_worth_still_going_to_college_when_i_have/,"Hello. I am writing this in tears right now, because I feel terribly lost and alone. I just don't know what to do. I feel like a loser and a disappointment.

*Long* story, I apologize:

I am a first year college student in community college, who has been dealing with depression for a good portion of my life now. I started in 2017, and was supposed to be in my second year now, but I withdrew from one class my first semester, then withdrew from two in my second semester. My mental health was already pretty bad by that time, in the spring of 2018. Now, it's winter and things have definitely have *not* gotten better. I am on financial aid probation. I stopped going to classes back in November, a week before Thanksgiving vacation. It's been a *month*. I just don't think I'll be able to do it.

Over the summer, my parents revealed some things to me, basically saying how they wasted money on my therapy back in high school, how they regretted ever doing that for me, and things got physical. I did *not* lay a hand on my parents, only to grab their arms to get them off of me because they tried to choke me. My father has a bad temper and heart problems, so I wasn't trying to exert him and send him to a hospital or anything. I said some stuff to them about not being there for me emotionally and how they drove my other sister away because of how they treated her (lives across the goddamn country). It's been months since the summer and I still don't talk to them. They're the kind of people that are traditional and set in their ways, really. They think depression and anxiety is something you can just get rid of the next day and that I wake up everyday *choosing* to be depressed, because why the fuck not, right?

My other sister, who lives here in-state still, tried to tell me, ""Oh, they say stuff when they're angry, but they don't mean it.""

Which is total bullshit. That shit came from the heart, they were sobbing and crying, sad for themselves really. Because of how expensive the therapy and medication was.

It just made me feel like a huge, huge burden. I feel really alone here. I have been to counseling at school, spoken to my adviser and such, etc., but it can only so far. I can't tell them everything, even though it is confidential, there are just some things you can't say to them.

Everyday I wake up, after only having maybe one - three hours of sleep -- some days I don't sleep at all -- and I walk to the train station to catch my bus. I feel like shit, I'm tired and sluggish, I slur my words, and I sway back and forth -- it's ridiculous. I can't sleep all night because I have too much anxiety, it makes my heart beat fast and I just can't get relaxed enough to go to sleep. Hours pass by, I check my phone for the time, and the minutes just go by as I lay there. The sun comes up, I give up on trying to sleep and just get dressed for school. Sometimes, I even get nightmares -- wake up abruptly in the middle of the night and I *can't* go back to sleep. I'm always too tired to function, I feel bad that I have a hard time focusing in class. I just can't do it, I even get nauseous sometimes. It's really affecting my performance.

I used to think about killing myself and just ending it, getting it over with and done, because I know I'm a burden and that I will probably just never get better. I just think that's reality, that I will always be depressed, in the end. I'm never going to truly be happy.

I already had these dark thoughts before starting college, but it's just become more frequent now. Pretty much everyday, I wake up thinking ""God, I should just hurry up and kill myself."" It's weird, though, because in the back of my head, I know that it's a crazy thing to think about, but at the same time I can't stop. I'm just so tired. I'm *really, really* fucking tired.

I don't have a real support system, only my older sister who lives in-state still. I don't want to tell my friends about my predicament. It's just embarrassing to me, and I don't want to sound like a drama queen. It was also how I was raised? I was raised to not tell anyone my personal business, and now I can't knock the habit. It's so ingrained in me, but I've been trying (reached out to my adviser who helped me make an appointment with a counselor, etc.).

I don't know anymore. I feel genuinely hopeless. I can't help but feel that I shouldn't have been born. I am truly not meant to be here. I don't know what my purpose is, other than to be a depressed, anxiety-ridden person -- the cautionary tale.

I just don't think going to college still is doing me any favors. It's added to my stress. Maybe I just started college too early? Maybe I should have waited until I got better. But I didn't have the money to see a therapist during the time I wasn't in school, so I didn't know how long that would take. I think I just applied for college because I thought the clock was ticking and I needed to do something, rather than waiting to get better so that things could go smoother for me in college life... which was the wrong thing to do, I guess. I was just working and isolated myself from everyone. I thought I'd make friends in college, which I did, but I still feel alone.

I feel like killing myself everyday. My heart hurts, my body is tired, my mind is tired and numb, and I just don't have it in me anymore. I'm so exhausted. I tried, I really, really wanted to do good in school. I have never done this badly in school before (had a hiccup there in high school, was still depressed then, but my teachers made a compromise with me to keep me going so I could graduate), and seeing my grades drop made me feel like absolute shit. I just don't think I have a place in this world. I wake up just feeling worthless.

Spyder_J,1307904979,/r/AskReddit/comments/hxwxw/has_anyone_else_concluded_that_college_was_a/,"I'm basically looking to start a discussion here. I keep seeing these articles on the internet questioning, ""Is college worth it?"" or some permutation thereof. Often it's grounded in the fact that there are so few jobs at the moment, while college is very expensive. Invariably there's a bunch of people in the ""Comments"" section talking about how the real purpose is an education, and it's very valuable, blah blah fuckin' blah.

Although that was the original purpose of universities, how many students are ACTUALLY attending college with ""learning"" as the primary motivation at this point? (And are colleges even needed for that in this day and age?) As I see it, people in the U.S. (my country) go to college for 1 of 2 reasons: (1) they've been brainwashed into viewing it as something of a requirement and they just kind of regard it as ""the thing that happens next"" and they drift straight from high school into 13th grade. (I was one of those.) OR, (2) they are using it as job-training to get a good job and hopefully have a good life. (In a sense I was one of these, too; although I majored in useless English, there were so many Guidance Counselors and the like squawking at me that ANY degree was an advantage in the workforce that I still thought I was doing something good.)

Let's be clear: this country is a fucking shark-tank. Competition in the workplace is ruthless and there is virtually no middle class, so even reasonably successful people like myself and my wife have to work like dogs just to get by and TRY to scrimp and save enough over time so that when The Calamity comes (as it always does, in some form) they're at least somewhat prepared and don't have to die penniless in the street. Consequently, unless you were born into wealth, you CANNOT afford to shell out the many, many thousands of dollars that college costs just for ""a well-rounded education"". Practicality has GOT to enter into it at this point; given the dog-eat-dog nature of our professional system and the absence of any satisfactory social safety net, regular people simply CANNOT afford to invest all of this money and time in college without a tangible return of some sort. And if it's not effective job training, then we need to get that word out to our young people to stop wasting small fortunes or going into insurmountable debt to attend these places.

And, of course, it IS NOT effective job training at all; even if you choose a profession for which college is essentially a requirement--law, medicine, engineering, accounting, etc.--you still have to take DOZENS of useless courses in order to attain that degree in your actual field of study. Why does an accountant or an engineer need to have 3 Philosophy credits? Ostensible Answer: So that their education is well-rounded. Real Answer: Because the university can charge $1,000 for those credits! At the end of the day, it's just a sophisticated form of extortion, with your degree being held hostage. So you go to the Intro class, pay your thousand bucks, do your accounting homework during the lectures, piss some nonsense onto a page as your final paper, and skate out with a B or C on a grade transcript that no one will ever read, but the college got their money! It's all such bullshit; plumbers don't have to take a Philosophy course or a Writing course. Why do accountants? Why do people in specialist trades HAVE to be well-rounded?

The most damning fact of all is that the entire alleged purpose of college is bullshit. ""A well-rounded education?"" Well-stocked public libraries have for decades been a pretty good argument for the fact that you can attain a well-rounded education without shelling out thousands upon thousands of dollars to universities. But now, with the internet? I can summon up dozens of expert-level treatises on everything from programming in Java to analyzing Shakespeare's Sonnets to how to install a garbage disposal, all without even leaving the house. Our technological infrastructure today is such that not only is college unnecessary as a means of bringing diverse thoughts and information to people, it's actually INEFFICIENT-- and from a ""cost"" standpoint, it is appallingly so.

However, at least in the case of the ""Accountant"" example, he/she actually DOES have a viable profession at the end of it all, even if there WERE a lot of unnecessary courses and dollars wasted in getting there. The REAL tragedy is that most of the degree programs offered at colleges--even practical-seeming things like computer training or mathematics--usually have no outlet whatsoever in the job market. Our 17-year-olds who aren't worldly enough to know better are being completely misled by the entire system about the viability of college as a path to getting what they need in life.

When I was 17, I worked on computers at NSA as part of a work-study program. I could've stayed on full-time after high school if I'd wanted to. Had I done so, I would probably be a millionaire now. I'd have 18 years in the government and I could probably retire with full benefits and a swollen retirement fund in less than 10 years from today. The health care for myself and my family would cost peanuts and cover EVERYTHING. I didn't understand the value of what I had, and nobody counseled me about it. Everyone just said to go to college, so I did, and now--instead of retiring from full-time work in my 40s--I'll probably be working like a dog until I'm 80 and I'll be lucky if I even HAVE a retirement.

Almost everyone I know who went to college doesn't use their degree. There is NOTHING I learned in college--no facts, no organizational habits, NOTHING--that I couldn't have learned just as well without college. And my degree has NEVER gotten me a job or had any bearing in my career. (To be fair, I knew at the time that an English degree wasn't the most practical choice, but I didn't expect it to be what it turned out to be: completely, 100% USELESS.) I don't mean to come off as cynical, and I'm ultimately happy with my life, but I really feel like myself and so many others have been royally rooked with this shit.

If nothing else, I'm encouraged to see these articles questioning college popping up in places. If anything good can come of these hard economic times, maybe it'll be a critical eye being turned toward this costly, universally-accepted scam that is financially raping our young people.

TwoT20s,1537592281,/r/college/comments/9hx6pz/i_dont_feel_too_good_at_my_college_choice_and_i/,"Throwaway because this is illegal and I feel like crap for doing it.

I spent my HS years grinding to go to a prestigious university, and by the time senior year rolled around, Northwestern University was my dream school. It had the best location close to home, a decent campus, and a lovely media department (filmmaking and radio are hobbies of mine). Despite my family's misgivings about cost, whenever I was on campus or saw it’s name I felt it was \*my\* school. And, lo and behold, I got in! (As for the other top 20’s around my home city of Chicago, I also got into Notre Dame but not UChicago).

Yet when it came time to choose in April, I panicked. I heard stressful things about NU. That people there were always overworked, when I visited people were uber-professional and serious (which isn't what I'm like, I can be pretty goofy). It seemed to be a lot of work for a school that isn't as prestigious as, say, UChicago or Harvard, and I didn’t want to be stressed anymore. While I was considering Tulane University over NU, on May 1 (the deadline to choose), at 7:30PM, I had a flash of knowledge. I'll go to Notre Dame! It's plenty prestigious, people there seemed happy, the focus on the whole person was dope (as opposed to just being pre-professional), and, unlike Tulane, it's close to home! I paid the deposit.

...the next morning I felt awful. Why did I choose to go to South Bend over Evanston, just outside Chicago? Do I actually belong at a Catholic school? Did I just waste my dream of Northwestern? Long story short, I submitted a deposit to NU the next day, too .(I had filled out a form that meant I was able to do it late). Of course, I still had to decide where to go college.

I didn't decide until August. In the mean time, I was turned down by the girl of my dreams after prom, so I was a broken man in both mind and heart. Life sucked. I graduated high school, and spent the best part of an otherwise awesome summer break ruminating. For three months, deciding which school was the only thought on my mind from morning 'til night, and it gave me so much anxiety I could hardly function at times. My thoughts became pretty erratic and I was often suicidal. How pathetic was I? Here I was, the funny, tall, and undoubtedly intelligent star of my high school, wanting to kill myself because I couldn't choose between two great colleges. My world completely crumbled; my mind went to hell and still hasn't completely come back.

The whole time I filled out housing, placement exams, and such for \*both\* schools. Eventually, it came time to actually pay tuition. I obviously couldn't pay to both schools, so, with a lot of anxiety... I chose Notre Dame, much for the same reasons I paid the deposit in the first place.

I've now spent a month there, and it's... fine. My roommates are cool, my professors are pretty good teachers, my classes are interesting, and I think I've adjusted to the courseload pretty well. But, my dorm itself looks like a prison built by a Catholic school, I'm physically uncomfortable all the time, and I hate South Bend so much. As someone who loves live music and festivals and big cities, it feels like I'm not part of the rest of the world, and since there's nothing to do there everyone just drinks on the weekends. I don't drink, but even if I did, it looks like it'd be boring after like a month. As someone who doesn't like football, even the legendary ND football games get pretty monotone after about a quarter or so.

Is this what my college years will be like? Work all week, and then spend the weekends downing Natty Lites in a house off-campus in a do-nothing town? 

It's my first weekend back home and I've realized how unhappy I've been. I still don't have the feeling of wanting to be a part of ND, whereas I still wanna be in Northwestern-- even as I'm typing this. I'm worried by the fact I chose the less prestigious school, that my peers aren't as intellectually motivated as I am (though a few are), and that the academics just don't suit how interested I am in so many disciplines . On the other hand, I definitely agree with ND's mission (""to be a force for good"") over NU's superficial professionalism. I like that I'll instantly form a connection with the ND ""family"" around the world after I graduate, and I like that people think of ND as ""home"" even after they graduate-- it's a sentiment I'd like to have too, especially in this crazy world. 

In short, every time I see Notre Dame or any of its logos (which is often), I feel unsure of my decision. 

Today is coincidentally Northwestern's move-in. Though I haven't filled out any forms or logged into my account or had any contact with them for a while, I still haven't officially told them I'm not coming. I feel terrible for unfairly and illegally taking someone's spot in that awesome school, and to still be enrolled in both (presumably, maybe NU took me off the rolls). Plus, I can't go back. Even if I want to go to Northwestern, I'll never get in again after what I did-- I'd be lucky if they didn't report me for enrolling in two schools. Transferring to another college is difficult and it would mean going away from home further (unless I go to UChicago). And yet, I always feel like I'm not supposed to be at Notre Dame.

This time last year I felt so much potential after all the years I worked in HS. The future was gonna be amazing! I was gonna go to a great university! I was going to do great, maybe even historic things with my intellect! But, the future isn't amazing. Do I go to a good school? Will I become great? I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever feel normal again.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. I know my problems are pretty good ones compared to the rest of the world, so sorry for being so whiny and acting like a r/iamverysmart bozo. It just helps to finally have all my worries out there.

TL;DR: Submitted deposits to two really good schools, eventually chose the one that \*wasn't\* my dream school, and I still feel absolutely buzzed out about it. :/",college,"I don't feel too good at my college choice, and I felt even worse deciding.

synesthesiatic,1304639968,/r/psychology/comments/h581k/bizarre_phobias_unexplained_inability_to_finish/,"Hi, /r/psychology

I'm a 23 yo Hispanic/Irish biological female, raised lower class in the South, military/Christian family, older brother, parents never divorced. I identify as pansexual and what the kids are calling ""genderqueer"" these days. I was homeschooled until the age of 12, and then put into public education. My mother tested consistently over 170 in the 1960s in elementary school on IQ tests, and my father broke the tests. He did things in ways that the administrators never even considered. I was reading Tolstoy and *understanding* it, at about nine. I finished LotR in about three days at the age of eight, I can draw, sing, write and have an undying love for psychology and amateur radio. 

I have a few things about myself that I'm trying to figure out and I'm hoping that someone here can offer some explanation or at least a direction. 

I've always been thought of as ""slow"". People have openly told me to my face that I don't seem as bright as the rest of my family. I have a stammer, and I have trouble expressing myself when I'm upset or stressed. The stammer gets worse with stress, and I often forget what I'm saying in the middle of a sentence. As a kid, it took me a really long time to learn how to write, but I could read before I could write. I couldn't sit still and I was really unthinkingly blunt and tactless. I still am. 

I have an issue of being unable to really connect with people - despite very much wanting to. I love people. I love helping them. I'm an empathetic and caring human being that comes across as a total ass most of the time. 

I know things about people that they don't want me to know. I'm an excellent cold reader. This leads to really awkward situations because I'll just blurt out what someone ""means"" to say, or how they actually feel when they're lying. 

I have trouble telling when people are being sarcastic or are ""joking"". I don't take teasing very well, either. I'm often accused of having a flat affect and of being removed or distant. I used to scowl without knowing it as a kid, so I literally had to learn to mimic other people's facial expressions and vocal mannerisms because I would sound angry or unhappy without meaning to. 

I have a lifelong love of studying people. People-watching is one of my favorite things to do. People are very much like machines to me, and I literally have diagrams of human behavior for each person I know, so I can more accurately predict their reactions to my actions. 

Those flowcharts? Kinda look like this in my head: http://jia-flynn.daportfolio.com/gallery/530898#4


Awhile back I made this post: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cqlsj/i_have_emotional_synesthesia_can_anyone_explain/

I understandably got downvoted into oblivion. It sounds like I'm trolling. It sounds crazy. It's still true. This comes and goes with varying degrees of severity. It hasn't been much of an issue for about a month. I'm not sure what triggers it, and I've had enough people calling BS and accusing me of being schizophrenic. I have been through a full psychological evaluation, and I was not diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with moderate depression and put on a drug called Savella - which is an SNRI. I stopped taking it because while on it I went between being incredibly violent, destructive and overemotional, to being completely dead and ""grey"" feeling. 

I have a ridiculous fear of going in circles. It is not motion sickness. If I drive somewhere - like to the store, I must go the same way I went. It's worse if someone else is driving. I don't let other people drive for me, ever. I don't like carousels, or watching races of any kind, or roller-blading. It freaked me out as a child, as well, my dad would drive in circles around the parking lot and wouldn't stop, even if I begged him and screamed and told him to park. I'd literally go completely hysterical and unglued. These days, it just makes me tight in the chest and panicky. 

I have had violent, horrible nightmares of just about anything awful you can imagine since I was a kid. They are still continuing. I either sleep too little or too much.  

Aside from that, I have a literal inability to follow through with anything. I will passionately pursue one thing for a few days, and then get bored with it or forget about it. It is having a negative effect on my life - I'm an artist, and I drop commissions from time to time simply because they're not ""in front of me."" The out of sight out of mine saying is horribly true for me. I can hyper-focus on things [ working on art, forgetting to eat / sleep / move for 10 hours at a time ] - or I can't focus at all. 

This destroys my ability to remember to do homework or follow up with people. Even if I leave myself postit notes and reminders on my phone, I feel like I can't get anything done. I'm easily distracted and spend long periods of time listless or bored when I in fact, have way too much to do. 

The reason for all of this is because I'm trying to go back to school to get my degree in Graphic Design. I've never, ever done well in school except for art, and I'm literally dreading having to take the remainder of my academic courses. 

Reddit, I'm tired of being thought of as stupid, and I'm tired of working miserable jobs because I don't have a degree. I'm tired of hurting people because I'm tactless and I don't know how to fix what's wrong with me. Whenever I've come across a behavior that I know of, I can go in my head and revise the behavior - just like rewriting a computer. Sometimes it takes longer for the rewritten instructions to catch on, but most of the time, it works like a charm. These are things I have not been able to rewrite and it's driving me nuts. 

I have an incredibly detailed, complex thought-life and a complete inability to express it or connect with other people. I'm afraid it's going to destroy my relationship with a really beautiful human being because he claims I'm secretive and withdrawn.  

I need some help. Ask me questions if you want to know something. I have nothing but time right now to answer them. 

I do not have health insurance or the means to pay for a doctor.

Cheers.

Hey guys. I'm posting this as I sit in my bed crying. I am completely out of ideas and completely hopeless.

In middle school I got a 4.0 GPA. I was in advanced classes and I was the teacher's pet and I did all sorts of extracurricular activities. I found my friends in middle school and I did really well. I procrastinated a bit but not much.

In high school I earned a 3.75 GPA. I procrastinated chronically but I always got things in on time even if it meant pulling three all nighters in a row (I do *not* recommend this). I always started things last second and turned them in right as I finished them at the latest possible moment. As time went on, this habit got worse and worse until I was emailing my teachers begging for an extension on my projects. I'm a teacher's pet, I'm extremely good at communicating, and I'm pretty convincing. These things all led to my teachers usually allowing me extra time to turn things in. And when I got my work in, it was exceptional and above and beyond expectations. I overacheived to compensate for my lateness. By my senior year it was pretty bad and I started not asking for extensions because I was so afraid to ask for too many. I did not want to risk coming across as lying or lazy. But it didn't ruin my GPA because I had a 4.0 all the way until junior year and I got decent grades in my junior year.

My freshman year of college left me with an abysmal 2.75 GPA. I didn't ask for extensions anymore because by then I became unable to get things turned in even if I had a large extension. I became incredibly depressed and nihilistic during my freshman year. I never left my dorm and all I did was sleep and watch YouTube to distract myself from the pain in my heart. Many a night saw me sobbing into my pillow and wishing I could just die. I failed my English class because I was so afraid of the final paper that I never even touched it.

My first semester of my sophomore year went pretty much the same way. I retook English and did extremely well up until the final paper, where I got farther along than last year but eventually became too terrified of it to continue, and I failed the class again. I had to pursue medical hardship withdrawal from philosophy because I missed so much class due to being so depressed and hopeless that I could never make it to class. I was surprisingly happy for the first half of that semester. I just detached myself from the pain I felt over not being able to do anything right. It caught up with me when finals week came along and I couldn't do anything to save my grades anymore. I got a 1.67 GPA.

I'm now in my second semester of my sophomore year. I'm on academic probation, which just means I have to meet with my academic advisor every other week and I'm not allowed to get more than one grade below a C. Unfortunately my advisor is extremely unhelpful and sometimes actually harmful. She has advised me incorrectly many times now. She doesn't really understand me either. I told myself this semester would be different. But then again, I also told myself that before every other semester. I'm about 8 weeks in and it's time for midterms. I've missed countless classes and I have done absolutely none of my work.

I'm going to fail again. I have a phobia of my work that neither I nor anyone else in this entire earth seems to understand. I have a job in IT (my major is CIS) and I do perfectly well in that job. I have no issues getting things done on time and I have kept the job for over a year now. One would think that how you do in school is predictive of how you will do in the ""real world"", but clearly that's not true in my case. I am not stupid. I got very high SAT scores and I have a great scholarship. As I hope you can tell from this post, I am also not bad at writing. That is why it pains me so much to fail classes like English and get such a low GPA. All I want to do is learn. I love to learn more than anything. My issues are not due not wanting to learn.

My college is unbelievably expensive and my parents are only paying for part of it (that is, if I graduate). The pressure from this is incredibly hard to bear the weight of. My parents don't understand me and only make me feel more worthless when I say anything about my schoolwork to them so I end up having to hide everything until it finally comes out at the end of the year that ""surprise, your daughter is a complete failure again!"".

To make matters worse, I have medical problems that make life even harder (IBS, hemochromatosis, chronic migraines, and narcolepsy). When I start to do well, I am punched down by one of these issues and it takes me a while to get back up again so I miss things while I'm down that make my grades drop all over again.

I have pursued medical treatment for all of my issues. I have gone through many counselors, none of which could help me. I have tried  (and am continuing to try) many medications for my mental health (I have severe ADHD and social anxiety). 

I'm in an endless cycle. I feel like I just want to curl up into a ball and cry forever. No one understands me, no one can help me. It feels like I've been given everything (intelligence, a somewhat wealthy family that loves me, and people who want to help me) but I can do nothing with what has been given to me. I wish I could just ""take one step at a time"" or ""be less hard on"" myself. I wish I could believe that ""everything's gonna be okay"". But I can't. I am useless and self destructive. I have no where to turn. I have tried everything I know of. I am so alone and so angry at myself that I hate myself more than anything in this earth.

drpfenderson,1349304091,/r/AskReddit/comments/10wgnl/what_is_a_reasonably_compelling_reason_for_voting/,"**Short background**: I am registered Independent, and have had the chance to vote in the last 2 federal elections. I apparently hold both ""extremely"" left AND right ideals, as well as sprinklings from Libertarian, Green Party, and Anarcho-Syndicalist leanings. I was very active in various political action groups both in school (high-school and university) and out of it, as well as working for the state senate for a while in my home state. **I also vote in local elections, as they seem to have less of the problems that I list below, as I've learned from personal experience.**

---

When it comes to the elections themselves, I see disenfranchisement on 3 major levels:

1. **Illusory disenfranchisement (Political Superbowl, or The Illusion of Choice)** - The illusion that somehow 2 candidates (or parties) can succinctly represent the wide spectrum of ethical, moral, economic, and other issues. This is an illusion that the media tells us to hold very dear, and has been perpetuated for so long that many people really do boil all of their beliefs into Democrat/Republican platforms. The inefficacy of third-parties, or the lack of a desirable candidate, further aggravate this point. See: [Manufacturing Consent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQhEBCWMe44)

2. **Corporate disenfranchisement (the Strings Being Pulled)** - The fact that much (if not most) policy on the federal level is made for economic reasons, and is mostly controlled by a small number of lobbying groups, economic policy ""thinktanks"", and corporations. That much of the perceived platform of a politican is severely undermined by the control that these organizations exhibit on the policy makers themselves. See: Chris Dodd, Tom Vilsack, Dick Cheney, Michael Taylor, Elena Kagan, John Ashcroft, Lamar Smith, Tom DeLay, etc. (And those are just a few picks from the past 10 years) See also: [The Corporation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnE8D3tgZ5c)

3. **Technical disenfranchisement (the Scam of The System)** - Voting fraud, voter scamming, the Electoral College as a whole, voting district gerrymandering, voter blackout, Super-/PACs and spending limit loopholes, and the blatant rigging of the stakes by various voting centers and the technologies they employ. This further cements the idea that your vote is really controlled by someone else. See: [American Blackout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjupTHsynec)

All of these make it very difficult to trust in the voting and electoral system, much less the candidates themselves. And so we are brought to specifics of the current election.

---

This year I have a (""real"") choice between two candidates: Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. The 2 other, major third-party candidates don't have anything extra to offer: Jill Stein is rather narrow in her focus, leaving much to be desired in her other policies, and Gary Johnson's policies seem to be extremely destructive and anti-human, and too narrow (again), as I don't feel that ""Free Market"" is the answer to every question.

Mitt Romney is an educated individual who doesn't seem to know how even the basics of income tax or foreign policy work, so that's not a good choice either.

The incumbent, Barack Obama, is a man who has gone against nearly every important political promise that he made in the 2008 election: we're still in 2 extortionately expensive ground occupations in the Middle-East/Asia (not to mention Indonesia, Africa, and nearly every corner of the globe), Guantanamo is still open and still horrifying, The Defense of Marriage Act still stands (he promised to abolish it), he still hasn't worked to end no-bid government contracts, he has supported in a large way economic bailouts of companies that he claimed he would work to fight, and has actively fought unions and worker's rights when he promised (over and over) to support them. And that's just the promises he's renegged on.

Under Obama's watch: more Americans were subjected to federal warrentless surveillance in the past 2 years than in the entire previous decade, America has carried out magnitudes more drone strikes and killed thousands more innocent civilians than under the watch of nearly any other president, authorized the murder of American civilians abroad, and has worked harder than any president in history to prosecute, harass, detain, and quash whistleblowers and political dissidents. He has passed executive orders to censor public reports on the War on Terror, to give his office immunity from prosecution for domestic spying and torture allegations, supported mercenaries with more money than any president ever, helped censor any information on CIA and military black sites around the world, and worked very hard at preventing any sort of environmental protections legislation to pass - most notably blocking use of the ESA. 

He's increased troop presence overseas to untenable levels. Obama is knee deep in the Monsanto mire: his USDA head (Tom Vilsack) is a former Monsanto lobbyist, as are Michael Taylor, his Food Safety Czar, Islam Siddiqui, his US Agricultural Trade Rep, and Elena Kagan, his pick for associate justice of the SCOTUS. And even as he says ""I support gay rights"", he doesn't support gay marriage, and has actively worked against legislation to give anyone the right to marriage - as president AND senator.

---

So the few arguments that come up again and again are as follows:

* ""Your vote counts."" - Other than for funsies and statistics, Citation please.
* ""Choose the lesser of two evils."" - Choosing between murder and the squashing of even the most basic civil rights (and probably murder) is not really a choice.
* ""This time things will truly be different."" - History begs to differ.
* ""Choose the best candidate for your ideology."" - It's weird. There doesn't seem to be a candidate that is against corporate control of everything, pro-environment, pro-civil-liberties, anti-war (real, terror, drug, or otherwise), pro-transparency and ""democracy"", and other pro-human policies - and has proven it through action and policy.

---

**TLDR; Can you give me a compelling reason, with evidence to back it up, that my vote counts against all odds; that a candidate I root for could actually change things for the better, and that it is in my best interest to vote in the current Federal Election in the USA?**

You can disprove any single points of your choosing, and I would love to discuss any of the points I bring up, but I feel that the overwhelming weight of the sum total kind of outweighs any one link of the chain you could disprove or change my mind on. I have great hope for the future, however, and await the time that the government and its leaders can accurately reflect the will of the people (separate from media and corporate control). It's just history that gives me a feeling of ill omen.

I am really hoping that for future academic years I am able to get a dependency override. My Dad is a borderline hoarder, and the house is a semi-health hazard. The house is covered in junk and dog hair. Nearly every square inch of open space has something on it. The Bathrooms are completely disgusting, and I have not been allowed to clean them because my dad is sensitive about me touching his stuff. The kitchen is absolutely disgusting. Rotting food and dished covering all the counter space. This summer there were bugs in the sink, but they are gone now. There is a big ass hole in the ceiling in the basement because there was a leak in the kitchen above that basement. There are ceiling pieces all over the floor right outside my room. My Grandma had a guy come look at the sink in the kitchen, and he diagnosed the problem but there wasn't enough money to fix it. He also said there is mold under the sink in the kitchen, but again no money for that. I personally have not been able to find the mold. We have also had insurance people drop us because there is mold all over the roof of the house itself. There was a random wet spot that showed up on the carpet one day. After a month, I finally convinced my Dad to do something about it, and he just ripped up the carpet in that spot, and didn't do anything further.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have much evidence currently. I will record a walk through of the house before I move out, include the hole in the ceiling, the mold on the roof, the random junk everywhere, the messy kitchen and bathrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I can add my own context to the situation. For about a year after moved in with my Dad, I had to live out of a suitcase in a room filled with junk in the upstairs part of the house. The Air conditioning in the house only works in the basement, and there was a perfectly good room in the basement that I could have slept in, but my Dad wanted me to be close to him at night so he wouldn't get lonely. (He also had a room upstairs, but he had a big window and a fan in his room, I didn't.) So I got to spend the summer sleeping in a 90+ degree room, so my Dad wouldn't get lonely. I also got a job that summer at 15 because up to this point I was often dealing with hunger. My Dad refused to go to the Welfare office to get more food stamps for me, or go to any private charity because he was embarrassed. After that summer the level of abuse went down. I had a job so I could pay for all of the living expenses and food that he was failing to pay for. I eventually moved into the basement room, and just moved all of my Dad's stuff out of it. It was a major shit show, with him forcing me to move back upstairs into the heat once, but eventually I got my own climate controlled space.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have the foresight at 15 years old to document any of this stuff. I also never told a counselor or really anyone about what was going on. Some family members Like my Grandma or my sister might be able to back me up on some of these claims, but because I am an Evil anti-mormon apostate that is unlikely to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Just Wondering if the house video and my own account would be enough for a dependency override. I won't be homeless when I move out, I have a lot of savings and a car and I am working 30 hours a week at my job. I guess one could say I will be at risk of going homeless, that might be a stretch though.

&amp;#x200B;

On Another note, my current plan for college is to move to Ohio, Go to community college for a year on my 21-22 Pell grant, and hopefully I will be able to establish residency in Ohio. According to [This](https://registrar.osu.edu/residency/), Using C-2 Residency classification, even as an 18 year old I can go to Community college full time, and as long as I switch all my shit to an Ohio Address, and I stay fully financially independent for 12 months, they will give me in-state tuition rates for OSU. I have really wanted to leave Idaho for a long time, and when I read about this policy it almost seemed too good to be true. It seems to be legit, but I am wondering if one of you would be able to reassure me about that one. Also, Are there any other states with loose regulations for establishing residency? Most states say you have to be 21-24, and stay for 12 months, and not go to college during that time to get in-state rates. My backup plan if I don't get in-state rates would be to just transfer to Boise State after my 1 year of Community college in Ohio. I'm Really hoping this plan works out, because it would be really really frustrating to go to Boise State, knowing full well that I could be at MIT or Harvard. Both My parents make well below the cutoffs for full ride at all of the top private colleges.

HelicopterParents,1344362468,/r/AskReddit/comments/xu1gb/regarding_parenting_where_is_the_line_drawn/,"In light of popular recent posts and some of my recent experiences, I'd like to walk you through the scenario that is my life, in hopes of helping many other people in my situation. 

This is a story 21-years in the making, but I'll try to keep it simple and avoid a wall of text as mush as possible. 

Some personal info that will help you understand the scenario better:

* 21 year-old male
* Entering my 4th of 5 years in undergrad 
* Oldest of 5 kids
* Highly educated parents/high income 
* My home is only about 20 minutes from my university

Let's turn the clock back a few years... I'm off to my first year of college, extremely excited to move out of my house and experience some independence, just like any college-bound kid my age. It was understood that despite my family being of high income, I would be responsible for covering part of my college cost (so that I would ""take ownership"" in my education, which I respect of them). We agreed that my parents would cover my academic related expenses (tuition+books), and I would cover my room/board expenses. Sounds like a good deal to me. Now me, being a 17-year-old, had no way of paying for my room/board out of pocket, so my parents and financial aide officers helped me take out the necessary loans, and it was understood that I would pay for all of my room/board expenses via subsidized loan, which would leave me with about $50,000 debt upon graduation (which I was fine with, because that amount is certainly manageable). 

Fast forward to my sophomore year. I'm living in the dorms again after being home for the summer. November rolls around, and I acquire what is called an ""MIP"", which stands for Minor In Possession Of Alcohol (a misdemeanor), and follow-through with all of the necessary court proceedings, then move on with my life, nbd. While I understand the severity of it, I am also aware that these things are handed out like candy on college campuses, I moved on. Shortly after, I was paid a surprise visit by my parents who informed me that they would no longer be paying for any of my college expenses as a result of my misdemeanor charge, which they had blown way out of proportion. So, now I'm responsible for paying 100% of my way through college. I put my tough guy face on, and was determined to do it, as people before me have come from much worse situations and managed to get through. I was determined not to be an entitled brat or a pussy. 

End of sophomore year, I move home for the summer. June rolls around, time to take out my loans for the upcoming academic year. Now instead of a $10,000 loan to cover room/board, I need to pay for ALL expenses, so I try to take out the necessary $25,000 loan. Time for my parents to cosign the loan. I approach them with the correct information, and was informed that they would not be cosigning a loan any larger that what was required for tuition+books, meaning that I had to move home and commute to school. 

Junior year begins, I'm living at home and commuting. I'm thinking ""Home isn't that bad. I have a nice bed, good food, etc..."". Then, things started to get weird. Now as I mentioned above, I'm 1 of 5 kids, meaning there are 7 people living in my house. As you can imagine, this makes my homework environment extremely unproductive. As a result, I begin staying in the university library every night until about 2:00 AM to study (thus avoiding the lack of productivity that is home). My parents don't believe me, they think that I'm out partying and such while I'm studying. I begin to receive an excessive amount of call/text (every night) asking for confirmation of where I was. Sometimes they even wanted a current picture of me in the library as proof. Sometimes when I come home, I see that my mail has been opened. Sometimes when I come home I see that my room has been searched. Keep in mind that I'm 21. 

So, basically I'm a university senior who lives at home due to shrewd dealings on the part of my parents. My belongings are sorted through. They need to know where I am, who I'm with, etc... whenever I leave. They utilize the ""my house, my rules"" phrase whenever I try to argue the above. I'm forced to sit through church ever sunday and pray at dinner (I'm a man of science). Control is being used and abused. My parents and I are constantly bickering about stupid/unimportant shit. When they have nothing to bicker with me about, they'll bring up something I did YEARS ago and initiate an argument about that. Or, we'll resolve/conclude an argument, yet they'll bring it up again a few days later. It seems to me that they feed off of arguing with me and each other. My dad is a great dad, but he's basically just my mothers puppet. If my mom were out of the equation, my father and I would have an awesome relationship. I think my dad secretly knows that what I'm going through is wrong, but he can't stand up to my mother. My mother is like some sort of evil, controlling mastermind. 

You're probably wondering why I don't just ""get up and leave""... Well, despite no longer paying for my academic expenses, the parents still pay for my dad to day expenses such as gas and clothes. 

Why don't I have a job? 

* I have a very prestigious internship, but unfortunalty it's unpaid. Still, you'd be a fool to turn this internship down. I need this for my future. 
* Even with a summer job, I wouldn't be able to afford to move out

Do my parents act like this with my younger siblings? No

So reddit, are my parents just controlling and strict, or am I being abused? I know there are tons of people in similar situations who are wondering the same thing. 

What can we do? Do we just have to wait it out until we graduate and can financially support ourselves? Trust me, as soon as I'm self-sufficient, my parents will be getting a big ""fuck you"" followed by me ceasing all connections with them for a very long time.

[deleted],1312958642,/r/AskReddit/comments/jeckt/having_problems_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Let me start off by saying that I'm unsure if this is the right subreddit for this. Tried posting in /advice without any luck. After a week, there wasn't a single reply. So I started looking elsewhere. 

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I have a tendency to ramble. Feel free to ask any questions you have. Throwaway account. I'm wide open.

I'm nineteen years old. Passive and non-confrontational to the point of letting people abuse me and walk all over me. I realize it, but realizing it and changing it are two entirely different things. 

Four years ago my parents lost their jobs. They both work in areas with zero job security. Mother takes care of the elderly and my father works in construction. Both are under the table. Couldn't afford the mortgage, but we didn't move out until after I had graduated high school in 2009. I didn't know it at the time, but when my parents lost their jobs they started doing drugs. They've smoked pot my entire life. However after they lost their jobs, they moved on to drugs much worse than pot. 

Family rushed me into college in September of '09, right after I graduated high school. Picked a shitty college and the first major that came to mind. Dropped out after a month and a half with $4800 in student loan debt.

My parents bounced from one job to the next, never able to keep the job. They'd get fired or quit for some reason or another. In July 2010 I started working full time at a gas station bringing home just over $1,050/month. By the beginning of October, my parents were taking my pay every week. They were living with my grandparents, I was living with my aunt and uncle. My grandparents were extremely stressed financially. My grandmother is on disability, and they had 6 people living in their house with only one person (my grandfather) bringing any income. I lost my job with no notice just before Christmas. The company decided to sell all of its locations in my area to a competitor. They told me on Monday and the store closed on Wednesday. So I had no money saved up and my jobless parents owed me $2,200.

Come tax time, I claimed my sister as a dependent. Received $4,800 for my tax return. I got $70 of it. Parents took the rest. They had already told the family that I offered it to them and my grandparents were so relieved that they wouldn't have to support my parents any longer that I felt pressured to not say anything. *Back to being too passive for my own good.*

My parents used the money to get an apartment. My name is on the lease, and the cable/phone/internet and energy/gas bills are in my name. I didn't feel comfortable doing this in the first place, but I didn't feel right objecting. I'd soon realize how big a mistake this was. 

It was at this point that the family and I learned how bad my parents had become. They had both been stealing from family members. Up until we moved into the apartment, nobody knew who the thief was. My aunt's energy/gas bill had been stolen. My grandmother's wallet and several of her rings. Three iPod touches had been stolen from me. Another aunt's purse had been stolen on Christmas Eve, it had over $3,000 in it that was supposed to be given out as gifts the next morning.

Turned out to be my parents who were stealing everything. Mom got a job at a local family owned grocery store a few weeks after moving into the apartment. She stole $1,600 from the safe. Got caught. Felony grand larceny charges. She then started taking care of an elderly woman whose husband had recently died. She got fired from there for stealing the woman's wedding rings. My grandmother got her a job taking care of a woman with Alzheimer's. It was a 24 hour care job and my grandmother, mother, and three aunts were going to split the hours. My mom ended up getting fired for stealing the woman's pills. 

Currently my parents bring home ~$3,500/month. After all bills are paid and groceries purchased they should have about $2,000 left. They never have a penny to their name. They have to borrow money every week for gas and cigarettes. They're doing crack or heroin, not sure which. Popping pills daily. 

They sold my car, that I paid for with my own money. They tried to get credit cards in my name without telling me, then lied to me when I confronted them about it. They pawned everything I own, valuable or not. They live like scum. The entire apartment is disgusting. Rotten food, old dishes, and trash lying all over. My bedroom is the only clean room in the house. They haven't bought groceries in nearly a month and a half. When I'm hungry I have to go to the nearby grocery store and steal from their buffet-style self-serve area, otherwise I don't eat. Other than using the bathroom or going to get food, I haven't left my bedroom in months. The bills are rarely paid, which has ruined my credit. We've had power cut and cable/phone/net shutoff several times. 

On top of all of this, I'm gay and my family is Catholic and quite religious. I lost my friends when I came out in high school. I had only one friend left after I came out. About six months after we graduated she got her first boyfriend and since then (it's been about two years, now) she's refused to speak to me. Won't respond to my text messages, won't answer my calls, un-friended me on Facebook and ignores my Facebook messages. I was her best friend, and she let me know it all the time. 

I don't know what to do any more. I can't find a job. I've been trying very hard since December, when I lost my job at the gas station. I can't sleep any more. The past few weeks I just lay there at night and I can't stop thinking about what a joke my life has become. I don't know how to get myself out of this situation, and it's only made worse knowing that I have nobody to turn to. 

If you made it to the end, thank you. This is so much longer than I wanted it to be. 

Tl;dr - My life fell apart and I don't know how to get out of the mess I'm in.

Also prefacing: If you can't handle long, angsty monologuing then might want to stop reading. And I probably overthink things. I know, this is a long read, sorry. I just don't want to make the wrong decision, I think it's a pretty big one that could really fuck me up if I make the wrong move. Also note, I'm a little oblivious when it comes to the real world, and I might be too presumptuous about a few things, including that I can even get a job in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

In highschool I was super interested in wildlife biology (well, still am), but I'm starting to grow more on the idea of just dropping out college to go straight into work. Just about anywhere as long as it's not fast food or retail (I know some people who have jobs that sound really cool to me actually, and they don't have degrees, so I know it's not impossible). 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are some of my selling points (or maybe just me trying to convince myself):

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like college right now, is a PRISON to me. It's the only thing on my mind. I can't do ANYTHING without becoming anxious thinking about it. It's making me depressed and feeling like absolute horseshit.

&amp;#x200B;

The line of work I want to go in for my degree hardly makes jack shit money on average to begin with &amp; there's huge competition in finding jobs. I would probably make more or less the same money with my degree than without one, basing it on average salaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live pretty quaintly and can figure out how to make things work on a low income, I'm smart enough not to just spend it all on pointless shit. I do my research. I never party, I'm antisocial so no eating out fancy, bars, clubbing, etc. Couldn't care less about that stuff. I help my grandpa with his vegetable farm which has a ton of food, much of which he lets me have for free. I know solutions to cheap, healthy food, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

(This ones a big one for me) I really hate the idea of wasting minimum 6 years (including grad school, which I basically NEED if I want to find a job in my related field) of my relatively young life on something that stresses me and gives me anxiety to no end, even when I'm not there. I'd be much more comfortable just having a simple routine of work, it seems MUCH less chaotic &amp; stressful and more stable than college life (Correct me if you disagree with that statement...). I know some people who live the kind of lifestyle I'm thinking of and they seem to be doing pretty well as far as I can tell, they never seem stressed out about work and stuff, and they don't seem to be scraping the bottom of barrels for food scraps. Anecdotal, I know, but still gives me peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a brother and we agreed to find a place together (if things work out and we're able to) and split rent, housework, etc. A roommate, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have relative connections. A lot of my relatives have good jobs, and also know lots of people who have good jobs/work. I could probably get a job through that way if I needed too. They're very friendly people with me, I'm sure they would help me if I really needed it. It's how both of my brothers got jobs at one point.

&amp;#x200B;

I create digital art, and have been asked to open commissions from some of my followers. I haven't done it yet, but plan to in the future. I could make some extra money doing that. Also I could also do dog sitting/walking (can't bring myself to do babysitting, I'm bad around children) for some extra cash. I'd probably enjoy it, too.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my reasoning. Some things I'm worried about however:

&amp;#x200B;

Can I support a dog? Even if I myself live cheap and quaintly enough, will I have the spare money to care for a dog's food costs and vet bills? 

&amp;#x200B;

Might seem silly but can I afford to play video games &amp; use the internet? I don't expect a lot of spare time, not as much as I have now, but can I afford good internet and stuff? (Of course, it's not my top priority or #1 concern)

&amp;#x200B;

Can I get a decent house? I'm perfectly happy with a small, simple house. The more rural, the better. Not a fan of urban areas, or even the more dense suburbs. I currently live in a moderately small suburb area, and it's pretty nice here. As long as I don't live in a shitty ghetto neighborhood I'd be OK (like, the ones you hear constant gunshots in, trash literally flooding the streets, and all the houses look like they just got through a tornado. Being in this shithole that is Louisiana, I've been through those kinds of streets before and all I have to say is: No thank you).

&amp;#x200B;

Strange question, but realistically, without a degree, how hard is it to GET a stable job and KEEP it? I don't want to get fired simply because they no longer need me there. And will I be able to get promotions? I've never had a ""real"" job before. School/class has always been my full-time ""job,"" usually. My parents used to tell me not to worry about getting a job and just focus on my classes for now. Kind of wish I didn't follow that advice. I do not know why they told me that. I've done work for pay, but I'm only talking about one-time job scenarios, no longer than a full week.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm just too lazy, and I'm probably just trying to delude myself into thinking of the ""I'm not cut out for it"" thing. I do consider myself an academically smart person, but I just don't like putting in the effort, perhaps. The thought makes me resent myself, but I can't help it. I'm probably just a shit person.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I'm really just trying to reason with myself here and it feels like I'm wrestling in my own head. So damn stressed over this.

pistachiodock57,1302627516,/r/AskReddit/comments/goc3g/what_can_i_dofamily_member_not_caring_properly/,"I've been informed about a situation involving some of my extended family, and their children not being properly cared for. I feel like there has to be something I can do, but I don't know what to do. I've never dealt with anything like this and I would truly appreciate some words of wisdom.

Everything I've heard has been through Facebook updates of the parents or children involved, or what the mom has told my mother. I do not doubt any of what I will be sharing here.

The mom, ""Joan,"" has two children from a previous marriage. Son1 currently lives with his father, Daughter1 currently lives with Joan and her husband John. Son1 (16) and Daughter1 (14) both have some issues, although I'm not real sure specifically what they are. Joan and John have 3 children together as well, Son2 (6), Daughter2 (4), and Daughter3 (1.5). Joan and John both have some special needs/issues as well. John can't work because he ""has ADD and the mind of an 8 year old"" (that is what Joan told us when explaining how they were getting a bunch of social security backpay). Joan can't work because she has too much anxiety about it, and because John can't be left alone to watch the kids because ""he'll get too busy playing on the computer or something and doesn't pay attention to what they are doing."" S2, D2, and D3 all have special needs as well.

They had been living in Joan's mom's old house, but somebody at the children's school had reported them to CPS because the kids smelled so bad and never had clean clothes. The county stepped in and moved the family from the run-down, dirty home they had been living in (the house wasn't even 10 years old, but was never cleaned or taken care of) into some transitional housing. They then rented a house. The rental house is a pigsty. They have multiple dogs and cats and all have fleas, so the house is full of fleas. There is mold in the house but Joan wouldn't clean it because ""that's the job of the landlord, not my job."" They didn't have a vacuum until my mom found a used one for them. They don't use it. They don't have a washer or dryer, and they supposedly cannot afford to go to the laundromat. They will sometimes go visit Joan's mom to do laundry, but oftentimes they are walking around in dirty, smelly clothes. Even when they do laundry, they are just bringing them back to a house that smells, and the animals sleep on the piles of ""clean"" clothes. My mom would only go visit them in the summer when they could sit outside. They don't bother using sheets, and just sleep on bare mattresses. The flea-infested animals sleep on the beds with them. Supposedly the county has a worker that goes and checks on them once a month, but I often wonder about that.

The family stinks. Literally. I cannot stand being in the same room as them. Even at outdoor functions, you can smell them. At Christmas time, they sat at a corner of a large room and I couldn't even go near that corner after they left because it smelled so horribly. When they bring food to potluck things, the food always has dog and/or cat hair in it (not just a little either).

I honestly do not know how the children are still in the home. S2 poops the bed (even though he's potty trained). My mom noticed at one point last summer that S2's stomach had a nasty red rash all around his waistband. Upon mentioning it to Joan, she just brushed it off as nothing.

Evidently Joan had heard that the county was going to come take the kids. So two weeks ago, she abruptly posted on facebook that they were moving. A week later I was visiting my parents when my mom came home from the local gas station (very small town) to say that the cops had been trying to find the owner of the rental house so they could get in the house to let the dogs out. They had just left all their dogs in the house when they left. Daughter1 posted on facebook about how she had to say goodbye to all her friends in the small town because they were moving.

Joan told my mom that they thought the house just wasn't safe anymore, so they couldn't be there anymore. When my mom asked what they were doing, Joan said they were finding things to do during the day and then just sleeping at the house at night (sleeping there, even though she said the house was unsafe...). Supposedly they are now renting a house in a different county for a month and who knows after that. The kids haven't been to school in a couple weeks. Even though Joan and John have some issues, they are obviously smart enough to be able to keep their kids away from CPS. Joan has told my mom in the past that she would just keep moving around before she would let the state/county get her kids.

To top it all off, Joan is pregnant once again. Joan and John decided to ""let God decide how many children they should have."" Although I don't personally believe in that, it's not something I would argue about in any other situation. They can't take care of the kids they have now, how can they keep having more?!

So to summarize, family member has multiple children, all which issues/special needs, and it is the opinion of me, my parents, and many members of their small community that the children are not being well taken care of. I have no doubt that they love their children. They really do. However, sometimes love just isn't enough. The children don't live in a safe and clean environment, and they are not given the help and support they need to thrive. I am not a fan of children being taken from their parents, but in this situation I can not support the children staying with the parents.

What, if anything, can I do? My heart feels so heavy knowing that these kids have mental and probably medical issues that should be addressed but won't be by Joan and John. I'm not familiar with my state's laws regarding child welfare, but I plan on spending my evening researching and seeing what I can find.

Writing this from a throwaway so I can be totally honest with you. **There’s a tl;dr at the end if you don’t have the time/interest to read this all**, but I think it might be helpful for me to put all my thought down on “paper” even if nobody reads it, so here it goes:

I’m in my early 20s and am very confused about what I should do career-wise that best balances job satisfaction, job security, expected income, risk of failure, etc. I know that I come from a privileged background and most of the options I am considering are good ones, so I’m not looking for sympathy, and I’m also not trying to brag. I'm lucky to be in my position, but I want to share it with you in order to get accurate advice. I’ll share a bit about my background and present situation, and then I’ll talk a little bit about the options I’m considering for the future.

Background: I graduated magna cum laude from UCLA in 2010 with a degree in economics. I got a few bad grades at the beginning and then had a 3.9+ for the last 3/4 of my time there. My senior year I was finished with my major and got very interested in math and computer science. I almost exclusively took classes in these subjects that year and did very well (better than I did in economics), but I was about a semester too late in realizing I liked these subjects to complete either major.

Present: I’m working at a “good” entry-level job at a company of the variety that likes to hire lots of 22 year old econ/finance/business majors every year. My job is secure, pays well enough (~$65k first year), and can be interesting at times, but I have a lingering feeling that I could be doing something that satisfies me more. The path I’m on at this company has more or less automated promotions where I would get promoted twice if I stayed here for 4-5 years, and I would probably be making around ~$90k at that point if I stick around that long.

Since part of my dilemma is over how much money I need to earn to be satisfied, I think it’s relevant to share my financial situation. I am just trying to be honest so I can get good feedback. If people think this is distasteful then I will redact this information. I think I’m very lucky to be in this situation, and I do not intent to brag. I have no debt, ~$350k of inheritance from a relative that is invested in a diversified portfolio, ~$10k in retirement accounts, and ~10k in a savings account that I keep intending to invest but never get around to it. To be honest, I’m really not sure if this is enough to change my outlook on my career. It is important to me to be able to live comfortably and eventually have the means to comfortably support a family, and I do not know if this is enough money to significantly change what kind of career trajectory I will need to be on to make this happen. None of my friends know about my inheritance, so I don’t have a good idea of what this means in the real world. I am interested in anyone’s informed opinions on this.

Thoughts about my future: I have considered several career paths I could go down. I will discuss them briefly.

1.	Go to business school, make $$$ doing something I expect I’d find boring
Pros: I could almost certainly get into a top school if I stay at my job for a few years. This is probably the path with the most financial security.
Cons: This sounds very boring and soul-crushing.

2.	Get a PhD in Math/Computer Science/related field. Become a professor.
Pros: This seems to be the most intellectually fulfilling option I have thought of. I presently enjoy these subjects very much, and I love the idea of collaborating with and being surrounded by brilliant thinkers working on cutting edge problems, even if they aren’t relevant to the “real world.” 
Cons: It would be an uphill battle to get into a top grad program since I didn’t spend my entire undergrad preparing for this, even though I got top grades in the classes I did take. Even if I get into a good grad program, there’s no certainty of finding a legit tenure-track position afterward. The kicker is that I’ll be making next to no money until my 30s, and even after that the financial outlook for professors is probably worse than any of the other options I’m considering

3.	Get a M.S. in Computer Science. Become a programmer.
Pros: Solid job outlook for computer programmers. I think this might be an okay compromise between options 1 and 2; I could still make a fair bit of money, and I think it would be a more rewarding career path than working in finance/marketing/management.
Cons: Master’s degrees are expensive. I only have limited experience programming professionally, so it might be a bit risky to spend that much on a degree when I could end up not enjoying the career that comes from it.

4.	Get an MFE (financial engineering degree). Become a quant.
Pros: I’ve always been interested in finance and trading. I would be able to apply my interest in math to my job on a daily basis. Big potential financial upside if things go well.
Cons: It’s not clear to me what the job prospects are for a 40+ year old quant; seems like there will always be smart 20/30-somethings coming out of grad school to fill quant roles, and I’m not sure it’s very easy to keep moving up the ladder forever.

If you have other ideas for things I could do that I might not have thought of, let me know. Tell me what you think I should do and why. I don’t expect reddit to be able to make my problems go away, but I still want to get some outside perspective. If you just read the giant heap of text above then thank you, but also I’m very very sorry.

**tl;dr I want to make money, but I also want to enjoy my job and not work totally crazy hours my whole life. I’ve considered going to b-school and doing that sort of thing, becoming an academic, or going back to school for computer science or financial engineering. What do I do?**

Neon_Salesman,1623271596,/r/college/comments/nw5wv4/academic_probation_appeal_advice/,"Hello, I am in the process of drafting an appeal for academic probation. To make a long story short I made a bad choice and provided a peer with test info in a course that I then failed. Accordingly, I only got 10 of the 12 necessary credit hours to be in good academic standing. At my university academic probation isn't punitive, but it's supposed to be ""supportive."" However, I will lose my scholarships for the semester, can't participate in varsity sports while on probation, and cannot hold an elected position in any clubs. 

The school suggests the following for appeals:

&gt;Outline the issue that led to you earning too few credits this semester, what you learned from that experience and how you plan to move forward, point out your academic performance in your remaining classes from the Spring semester, and propose why you shouldn't be placed on probation

Members of r/college, if you would be so kind, please share your thoughts on my appeal draft. Do I convey my thoughts succinctly and appropriately? Do you believe I am making a fair argument. Thank you in advance.

Note I have edited some things for privacy. I am a rising senior.

&gt;I wish to appeal the motion for academic probation on the basis of my 2021 Spring Semester. In the Spring of 2021, I was enrolled in Course. I made a regrettable decision during the course of the class to provide a peer with test information. This resulted in an Academic Integrity violation and my failure of the course. Thus, I earned only ten of the required twelve credit hours for the semester. I have met with Dr. Professor, the professor of course, and Dean Dean regarding this incident, and completed all requisite ethics training.   
&gt;  
&gt;In reflection, I know and believe my actions were unacceptable. I undermined the learning potential of myself and my peer, as well as the atmosphere of academic excellence at this university. However, this isolated incident of poor judgement and forethought has reinforced the values I hold by showing me what happens when I neglect to adhere to them. It has also shown me the value in being candid and honest about my decisions. I hope that this isolated incident does not become a hallmark of my undergraduate experience or a roadblock to my future. Rather, it will serve as a personal reminder and a learning experience for the consequences of shortcuts and ill-guided decisions. I can say with utmost certainty that an incident of this nature will not, ever, happen again. I have learned much, and continue to learn and grow from this occurrence.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respectfully ask that the Academic Standing Board does not make a motion to place me on academic probation. The event that has caused my deficient credit acquisition has been resolved completely. It will not affect my academic performance in the future. This was an isolated case of one poor choice, and does not reflect a trend of poor academic performance. Through my written and oral ethics tutorial with Dean Dean, I have already engaged in and completed an extensive process that has allowed for meaningful reflection. It has also proactively prepared me to finish my final two semesters with diligence and esteem.   
&gt;  
&gt;I believe that my other courses in the Spring of 2021, of which I received A’s in all, and my transcript as a whole, demonstrate that I am a capable student; that the framework of academic probation is not necessary to continue on towards my degree.  I fully understand that academic probation is not punitive in nature, but is a supportive measure that enacts rigorous guidelines to focus efforts in the classroom for success. Accordingly, I do not feel that I am a candidate for this measure. These missing credit hours have not altered my intended schedule, timeline, or outcome of my studies. Even with a sole failed class, I maintain a GPA of 3.78 and I am well on-track to finish my undergraduate plan, a dual major of Chemical Biology and Psychology, on time. I am confident that all courses I will take for the remainder of my time at University will be A’s or B’s, as has been the pattern throughout my undergraduate career thus far.  I know that I can continue to be successful as an independent undergraduate, without the structures of academic probation.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to emphasize that I have maintained my current academic record whilst being a member of the VARSITY SPORT, and holding elected positions in both STUDENT ORG and STUDENT ORG. I take great pride in representing University as a student-athlete, and I would be honored to continue to do so as a rising senior in the fall semester. I believe that this host of extracurricular activities, in tandem with my academic record, demonstrates my ability to balance significant time commitments outside the classroom and excel in the academic setting. I have no doubt in my ability to continue my studies responsibly in future semesters. These activities, VARSITY SPORT in particular, help me to keep a well-planned and efficient schedule. In the fall semester of 2021, I will enroll in 15 credit hours of courses. In the spring of 2022, I will finish my undergraduate requirements and graduate. I also plan to retake COURSE, although not a degree requirement, to demonstrate my capability and honesty as a member of University.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the financial implications of academic probation would place a significant burden on my family. As the recipient of a sizable scholarship from the university, it’s revocation would raise my tuition by over $X for the fall semester. As my younger sibling prepares to begin college this coming fall, my family simply cannot afford tuition for the both of us if mine increases so drastically. Therefore, I ask that if the board should decide to move forward with academic probation, they maintain the scholarships I am currently receiving.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is my hope that you will consider this 2 credit hour deficient semester as nothing more than an outlying data point in my undergraduate career, and conclude that I am not a student in need of the support structures imposed by academic probation. I would like to reiterate my most genuine regret for my academic integrity violation and the lessons I’ve learned from it, as well my steadfast dedication to excellence in my education. I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration, and I know you will weigh this decision with the utmost care and concern.",college,Academic Probation Appeal Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/nw5wv4/academic_probation_appeal_advice/,1623293196.0,can't afford tuition ,7.273333333333333
LittleBitSpooky,1491700121,/r/college/comments/64ak00/im_a_professor_this_is_what_i_tell_my_family/,"I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. 

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

RockBou,1480931918,/r/college/comments/5gl56t/opinions_on_college_attendance_policies/,"I'm a little bit biased on this because I'm personally against using attendance as part of a student's grade. I'll lay it out, based on my thoughts, like this. 

**Rewards &amp; Penalizes You Regardless of Ability**
This is probably the most frustrating point for me. When classes weigh attendance policies like this, it's not truly representative of performance in the class. I've seen people who are generally terrible at the assignments pass classes because of attendance alone, while others who perform excellently are penalized for not being present. For example in one of my classes my grades are:

*Assignment 1: 100
Assignment 2: 95
Assignment 3: 100
Assignment 4: 95*

Based off this alone, my average would be a 97.5 but when you factor in my attendance grade (58) which drops quite a bit for every missed class my average is an 89.6 barely rounding to an A. The class itself is a 4000 level class &amp; requires effort (for instance one of my 100 grades was a 21 page paper I wrote) but the attendance policy either hurts or help you by eschewing your actual success in the class. Another one of my classes not only has a daily attendance grade, but also takes a point off your total average for every day you miss past 2 days. 

**We're Already Paying for the Classes**
Especially in America, where tuition is ridiculous, it's very frustrating to have to shell out huge amounts of money for the opportunity to attend a class only to be penalized when you don't. In one sense, it's already wasted money on our part, don't add salt to the wound. College is expensive, and when we miss days not only are we reminded that's money wasted, but we're missing out on the material being covered that day. Also penalizing our grade as well is just going overboard.

**Students with More Responsibility Suffer More**
Yes it's a student's responsibility to attend class, but it's easier to fulfill that obligation when you're not juggling other responsibilities. In my case, the number one reason I'm not attending class is because of work. I typically work nights since I have school during the day. Some days I'm more exhausted than others, getting off of work at 6am and then having class at 9 am is an extremely difficult task to pull of sometimes. This is especially frustrating because I work to make sure I can afford to go to college and in general survive day to day. I've also seen people miss class because of: Parents having to take care of a sick child, People helping out their families or attending familial events, work scheduling errors, court cases, travel complications &amp; more. The effects of these events on a student's grade (via participation) is generally up to the goodwill &amp; kindness of the professor. 

**Sick? Suck It Up**
Another reason I've missed days is due to an occasional sickness. The problem is, per regulation, the student health center is not an accepted medical excuse. Going to the doctor requires even more time, travel and money. This means that for myself and many others you either have to go to class sick, shell out money for a doctor, hope your professor takes pity on you or take the hit on your attendance grade. 

**Why do you want unmotivated students anyway?**
For some students attendance policies keep the lazy students who would otherwise never attend in class. I've heard this as a ""for"" attendance argument, but the question it raises to me is, why do you want those students there? These are the students I typically see idling their time away, talking in class, complaining or hassling the professors and distracting other students. In classes without attendance policies, I tend to see more motivated and interested students arrive to class. I also find that we cover &amp; discuss more in those classes compared to others.

**It's Favors the Wealthier**
Students who can afford the more expensive apartments or dorms near/on campus benefit from being able to walk to their classes and arrive quickly. Students who don't need to work on the side have more free time &amp; sleeping hours available. Students who can afford good vehicles or repairs on their vehicles can drive to campus on time. Students who can afford a doctor's visit get a valid excuse. Students who depend on the bus or walking for transportation are at the mercy of the weather &amp; the bus schedules. In one of the odder cases of income favoring, one of my friends who lives in the shadier area of town had his vehicle broken into and tires slashed. He ended up missing two classes because of that and took a hit accordingly. These things largely can't be helped, but attendance policies sometimes seem like they're penalizing people for things that can't be helped.

**Arguments For Attendance- Naturally since I want to hear your opinions I'll also list some reasons I've been told that attendance policies are good, minus my counterarguments.**

**It's an Easy Grade Booster**
Most common for argument I've seen with students. If you attend class it's fairly easy to pass the class, even if it's difficult. Attendance grades can also give you the boost needed to go from a B to an A.

**It Teaches Responsibility**
College prepares you for life &amp; careers, you can't just not show up for work. Sometimes you have to balance multiple responsibilities in life &amp; other areas will take a hit. 

**Professor's Don't Want to Teach an Empty Class**
Professor's want their students to do well and be present, largely. In classes with attendance policies they get to work towards both of these things with larger concentrations of students. It also makes sure that professor's aren't wasting their time. 

**It Rewards People Who Make an Effort**
Even if you're not particularly good at the subject, it evens up the playing field for at least rewarding the students who make the effort and attend every class. For the lazy students it does penalize them so they're not portrayed as equal to the ones who arrive on time every day.

TLDR: I'm personally against College Attendance Policies for the initial reasons listed. I recognize that there are pros to the policies as well however (also listed). What I want to know is your thoughts on this for or against and arguments why. Please try to list actual concrete reasons rather than things like ""It's Because the Professor's are Jerks."" or ""I want to sleep all day""",college,Opinions on College Attendance Policies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5gl56t/opinions_on_college_attendance_policies/,1480953518.0,can't afford tuition ,7.266666666666667

*Coupon, Clearance, and More*

I hate this tip because it makes me look insane to my friends but I save money so I don't care. Walmart is the exception but most grocery stores have an app or printout with coupons and sales. Study and clip the ones you buy for yourself. Don't buy something because it has a coupon, only clip ones for stuff you already buy. Most stores have a clearance section, try to find the meat section and buy and freeze that meat, meat is the biggest expense I have on groceries so finding this out saves me 20-30 bucks on meat alone. Without coupons, clearance, and all that, my grocery bill would probably be almost double than it currently is.

*Plan your Spending*

I never raw dog my spending, I always have it planned out. For me I have in my calendar app my errands and how much I need to spend. For example, I go grocery shopping for 20 days out so on October 20th, I can spend 110 on groceries. I also plan some fun things like maybe 20 dollars for bath things, or 10 dollars at a fast food place. This just makes it a lot easier to budget and you get better as you learn your habits and needs. I don't put my entire budget on it because I like their to be some wiggle room to go on a spontaneous cookout run or something and you never know what's going to happen.

*Check your accounts everyday*

This won't save you any money but it does allow you to pace yourself and your spending. When I wake up, I make sure to check my bank account, credit cards, and Venmo (and school grades but that's not financial, just a good habit.). This just shows me how much I have, how much I am spending, and how much I can continue to spend. It also just makes sure there's no fraud, surprise purchases, or subscriptions. I also had financial anxiety my first couple semesters where I would be too scared to check balances and therefore would spend terribly. So getting in the habit and getting comfortable with viewing your balances is key to having everything in order. 

*Please don't get into addictive habits*

This is a more honest mistake I made, I got into vaping my senior year of high school in the pandemic and still struggle with it, honestly I don't do it often, just in the morning and at night but it still takes around 50 dollars a month from me that I could use on better things. If you are on the fence about these things, just stay away and use that money on things that will bring you honest joy. My friend quit and she's spends the money she would on vaping on bath and skin care and stuff like that.

*Store Brand is going to be your new best friend*

There are of course, store brand things that just don't cut it, but try to make some substitutions and see that grocery budget go down a lot. For example when I go grocery shopping, I will get store brand pizza rolls (they are 10x better than totinos), cereal, chips, and fruit snacks, pasta, sauces, cleaning wipes, paper towels, etc. most of them are the same and made in the same factory, you'll live. Sodas, hair products, etc I get name brand because those are just my afforded luxuries. 

*Plan those luxuries*

You can budget all you want for necessities but 99% of the time, you will slip up and that okay, we all do it. I decreased this in myself by putting on my calendar budget, 20 dollars on a date night with my boyfriend, or 50 dollars on an Amazon haul on apartment stuff. This just allows me to just be able to have a bit of fun while staying on a budget

*Go off campus as soon as you can*

On-Campus living is very expensive and while you are not paying for it now, you will soon. Most campuses have a 1 or 2 year mandatory dorm living experience but see about getting an exemption or something to get off campus asap. When finding an apartment, skip on the big corporate housing like those 20 building apartment complexes, and find a local, realtor. Ours just owns like 5 2 or 3-unit houses around town and personally takes care of them all. The rent is amazingly cheap, and I live close to campus in an actual house instead of student apartments which tend to be shit often.

*Cut down on Services and Subscriptions*

If you are in college, I know its tempting to get doordash or ubereats but I promise you its not worth it. Go pick up the food if you really wanted to get takeout food. With subscriptions, always look up student discounts. For things like Hulu or HBO, try to set something up with your friends to split the bill, most allow 2-3 people on at the same time so see about spllitng up that 12 dollar Hulu account.

*Be Smart with Drinks*

This is just an nsfw tip but very useful and a little shady. Be safe but try to just get alcohol handed to you. Typically friends will be open to share and just drink what they have or what's handed to you by trusted people, its expensive, I did not pay for alcohol for the first 2 years of college from this.

[deleted],1332360330,/r/AskReddit/comments/r78au/career_advice_for_a_disillusioned_research_analyst/,"Since reddit has experts on everything everywhere, I figured there was no better place to turn for some career advice. (As best I can tell, this is the subreddit for this kind of question.)  I want to keep this as brief as possible because I know hearing about other people's jobs is about the least exciting thing ever, but I also need to give my full background so you know where I'm coming from, so bear with me.


I worked for four years as a data manager/research analyst/project manager for a market research firm, hated every minute of it, looked to my bosses as the person I would become and saw a pack of miserable, overworked souls with no time for family, friends or hobbies. My only purpose was to make a bunch of a rich old men even richer and make as much money as I could in the process, contributing nothing to society or my own personal growth, just the classic American capitalist with no conscience.

Took a job doing the same in public health. We have a database of most people in the state and I calculate the rates at which they access our services and use those as a starting point for research projects, I've presented findings at conferences and am working on my first manuscript for publication. It's a stable job that provides for a modest middle-class lifestyle, and it's more fulfilling than determining how to better sell products to people, but I still feel no passion for what I do.  It's pretty low-level stuff, very bureaucratically constrained, and incredibly slow. Most of what I do is repetitive, the same reports every year, too many budgetary and legal limitations to do anything ambitious.


Some examples of where I shine:

The most I've ever enjoyed my job was during H1N1. I was in charge of managing our entire state's inventory of vaccines/antivirals/supplies/etc., deciding who gets what, doing a lot of PR with county health departments and doctors and members of the public and the press. I wasn't supposed to be in charge of that, but I took it upon myself because we were all improvising and I felt I had the best skillset for it. There was no real process in place for this and I saw that we would quickly get overwhelmed trying to manage it internally with Excel spreadsheets, so I fasttracked a request to get a programmer and develop together an online application for the state, counties, and doctors to use to apportion, order and track supplies. It went from concept to rollout in less than a month and was a huge success. It was entirely my brainchild (though I lacked the programming skills to actually write it, I am able to mostly speak their language to convey what I want and understand what they're telling me) and once everything was over, the state purchased a more robust software package that was modeled around what I designed, and it is now the system we use for all disaster/outbreak response.

At my old job I was the main guy for doing web surveys. I'm pretty knowledgeable about HTML and can steal/tweak javascript via google. The software we used was designed for telephone interviewers to use, and you can create basic web layouts with it by clicking a few buttons. It used to be that for anything beyond their stock templates you had to go to the IT department which made jobs more expensive to sell (they made a lot more money than we did!), but after tinkering with the outputted code, I figured out all the important variables and commands and eventually created a detailed customization guide that basically made the developers obsolete for web surveys (they, uh, didn't take too kindly to that, but it was not their primary job anyway).  

When I came into my new job, my main duty was these annual rate reports. We'd export data from the database, import it into a software package, that software spit out a PDF of rates, you typed the rates one by one into a spreadsheet, then entered those rates one by one into a Word template.  It was time-consuming and tedious and I knew there had to be a better way.  I figured out instead how to export the reports to Excel, then I recorded/edited (again, with google's help on VBA) a macro that copied the rates from that file and into the spreadsheet, then I linked that spreadsheet to the Word template which automatically pulled in the rates.  It cut out probably 90% of the work (and kind of made the job obsolete - eventually I moved into another research position in the program and now I basically do both jobs).


If I had to summarize the common aspects of all those situations, they would be:
-Identifying and eliminating inefficiency
-Ingenuity, finding a novel solution to a problem (that most people didn't consider a problem in the first place)
-Initiative, taking on responsibility that isn't necessarily mine to begin with
-Computer skills, though I'm not exactly a full-fledged ""computer guy"", using what I know and my ability to find answers to what I don't know to accomplish something that is technically above my skill level
-Cross-discipline work, going beyond a singular speciality, fusing different areas of knowledge 


What's really holding me back is my education. I was the classic smart screwup, went to state college, stumbled through three different majors (CompSci for a year, math major until I quit with the minor, and finally a BA in psychological research with a 3.5-something). I feel like a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none - I'm good at math but am by no means a stats wiz, I'm good enough with computers that I'm usually the best non-IT computer guy anywhere I work but couldn't hack it as an actual IT guy, and I just don't enjoy academic pursuits enough to get into the whole research cycle.  Most of the jobs I'd naturally progress to from here require a master's degree, but when you're 8 years into a career, going back to school seems daunting and expensive.


I know some of you out there must have really interesting jobs along these lines.  What do you do, what education would help enable me to do that (or, ideally, what could I do with the education and experience I have)?  Help me, reddit, you're my only hope.

theplan101,1428065025,/r/college/comments/31axyy/considering_dropping_out_in_the_us_and_starting/,"This is my long, frustrating story. If you spot alternatives, please let me know I'm just reporting situations as they've happened to me. If you're not familiar with the American college system this may not make any sense to you.

I am American in my mid 20s so not much time left. A few years ago, my family and I moved to Washington state.

I now attend a community college here. I wanted to study the french language and american government (or along international relations/world history). These are subjects that I'm really passionate about and I've made nothing below a B- (3.30 GPA) in my studies so far.

About 4 semesters in, I'm now told my college is removing courses due to budget cuts. At the same time, I need these courses to graduate. I need these courses to fulfill my credit requirements. 

They have cut the french language (unofficially, in favor for spanish). I'm told the protesting, petitions, and etc. have all already occurred in the class before me. Higher ups weren't phased. The other students have no idea what to do either from what I've gathered.

The college that I attend is the only practical college ""in state"" in Washington until Olympia/Seattle (4-5 hours north by Amtrak.) There is another university but they do not offer languages whatsoever! The trend continues to spread it seems.

I've contacted the Vice President. He and my advisor came to the conclusion that I should try to fulfill my credits at another school. Problem is, I'm 10 minutes away from the state border.

All of the universities start 15 minutes from me in Portland, Oregon. Oregon considers me ""out of state"" meaning I'd pay out of state tuition even though they're 15 minute from me. Portlanders themselves can [barely pay *in state* tuition](http://koin.com/2015/03/12/psu-students-expected-to-protest-tuition-hike/).

I researched this a bit more and Financial Aid will bail on me also. I was told by the Financial Aid dept at my school that Financial Aid would only pay for my ""home"" college, not another college at the same time, especially out of state. 

Also, to receive Financial Aid I would need to go ""full time"" (12 credits) to have everything paid with the pell grant. My entire problem is over about 4 credits for now. 

The universities in Portland are clearly not a practical option and after research, I'm seeing that the community colleges may not be either. 

I need about 4 credits in french to satisfy my degree however community colleges in Portland offer the course at only 3 credits per class. Meaning, I'd need to take two, 3 credit classes just to get the one extra credit to fulfill my degree. 

According to their website, and without the help of Financial Aid, I'm looking at [200€/ $220 per credit.](http://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/tuition/). This is out of my pocket while still trying to keep up with my courses/tuition in my home college.

None of this is for sure. I was told that even if I did go to another college to do all of this, I'd have to have these credits ""approved"". There is a whole ""petition"" process. The other advice I was given is to start over ..with Spanish. For starters Spanish obviously isn't my passion and secondly I don't know if they'd cancel spanish halfway through either!

All I wanted to do was learn french, study government, get my degree and transfer. I don't understand why it has to be this complicated. There has been other issues too, like this college requires 3-4 pieces of documentation for me to qualify for ""in state"" tuition which of course I have them all dated at different dates. This means that although I do have 2 documents and proof of residency like a bill, because one document is not one year old I'm paying out of state tuition even now. Financial Aid barely covers it due to the out of state tuition eating away at so much. I only got $30 left towards books and I'm taking 25 credits the semester.

What I've considered lately is dropping out. My associates means nothing in Europe form what I've read. I can't seem to get my degree in the US at this rate and even if I did I don't think it would be worth much more than it would be in Europe. The only thing transferrable in Europe would be my high school degree correct? In the US I'm also concerned that taking on $16-20,000 in student loan debt will prevent me from otherwise visiting Europe if I don't go now. I'm considered out of state, everywhere I turn. The tuition seems to be getting out of hand especially compared to living my studies in Europe.

Instead of continuing my associates I plan to get a job in the US and save up for about a year. I would save up the $7,000 or so required by the visa, planet ticket, and save up enough to take up a language school to learn french. I would go to france by finding a school to teach me what I need to know to pass the Delf, Dalf, TCF exams. I already have a few semesters of french under me so in the immersed environment abroad I'd hope to learn incredibly faster. 

From there I would enroll into a university for my L,M,D studies. The only thing I have not worked out is continuing the income of money but my family said they'd *try* to help.. although I'm not confident. I also have no real skills, which is why I want to hurry this along so I can have something to show for myself. Once abroad I would likely change my studies from American government (irrelevant?) to the diplôme universitaire de technologie and do network security.

This has been my story and my alternative plan so far. I'm not saying it will be easy but it's my alternative plan at least. I would really like my bachelors before I'm 30. I can't say too much here, as I said I've spoken with people in the know but this is the gist. What do you think? 

Most people I could ask want me to remain in the US my entire life. Others I've asked already in france have been helpful but lacking the perspective of being either American or in France. I'd highly prefer someone familiar with both to judge or just anyone that has done something similar to start over in france. Thank you.",college,Considering dropping out in the US and starting over in France.

microbialvixen,1448949847,/r/college/comments/3uyrm8/how_do_i_balance_life_and_full_time_work_and/,"Anyway here is my life story I guess and I apologize if the post seems very sporadic: 

28 years old. Working full time 40 hours a week. Fixed schedule with weekends off. Hours are 10-7PM, with two fifteen minute breaks and half hour lunch. College is full time 15 credits. Majoring in microbiology still don't have bachelors degree. Took a few years to figure out what I was actually interested in.  I basically have no social life/dating and rarely ever see my parents, have no time to eat and sometimes feel like I don't have time/energy to shower (so embarrassing). The only time I see friends are far and few and even then I'm still stressing out about studying. 

In high school, I worked as a dental assistant until high school ended. I had only worked part time. Before anyone says anything I did get paid pretty decent being a high school student. Not something to live off of but just to pay the bills and have some fun. At this time I thought about going to dental school for orthodontics but decided it was really not for me. 

My parents never went to college, first generation here. it was difficult for me to figure out to do after high school. My mom pushed me to go to college right after high school but I had other ideas. I applied to college anyway and failed many classes. I quit. They were not happy. I took time off to work and travel. Came back to school did much better. School was basically off and on for me due to money and FAFSA not wanting to provide money for me because my parents ""made too much"" for this household.  It wasn't until my brother started college that I got some financial aid but even that was not enough.

Now I'm back in school and especially with my job with the hospital (not a clinical setting but an office setting/insurance). While it is great my work schedule is fixed, it can be a problem when it is the new quarter and the classes don't work with my work schedule. Work is low stress with no overtime but there are times when I leave work where I can't shut off my mind thinking about work. And sometimes it sucks getting off work at 7PM when the tutoring center is closed and classmates rarely have energy to study with me at that hour.

While I know it is possible to finish school and work full time I would definitely like to be able to volunteer or shadow MDs or PAs and get some experience in hopes of applying to med or PA school. I wish to be able to find free time to go to meetups to learn Spanish, go climbing or be able to socialize. Unfortunately meetups and volunteering/shadowing are on weekdays - the days I need to use to study. Sometimes it gets stressful being inside. I never get to soak up the sun and I have SAD and I've been very sedentary. I feel low on energy after work where I feel the ""after work blues"" - where I plan what I'm going to do after work like meet for food with a friend but I always end up bailing and probably due to winter it contributes to me bailing a lot.  I study but I'm also not very diligent and it takes full force will to get me to do it. 

It's just so damn hard to concentrate or stay motivated. And I really do not want to fail classes. I try to save money and not be in debt. I've never pulled out loans and paid for school out of pocket for the most of it. I try to never go out and eat and always bring my own food. Sometimes I wish for adderall, I know I'm just looking for an easy way out.

I've spoken with professors about this but most of the time it's ""focus on one thing."" Almost sounds like quit work and just stay in school and take just one class a quarter. While that sounds great I still have rent, gas money, food, car insurance, etc. to pay for. I think maybe I am spread too thin. I have to many interests and I don't know how to stop some times. I want to be able to relax by playing cello or piano as well but if I do that, that means I have to put studying up in the back burner. Like if I took a break to play piano I might end up playing for hours and lose track of time.

Not sure if this means anything but 

My commute to school and work is basically like this and can change up:
option 1: Drive to work. Park. Take public transportation to school bright and early. Finish school and take public transportation back to work. Finish work. Go back to school to study or stay at work and study. Takes about 45mins

option 2: Ride bike to school. takes about an hour to an hour and 30 minutes depending on how fast I want to ride. This time let’s me relax a lot. Which is great but also time consuming. Then ride to work which takes about 20 minutes. but then I have to ride my bike home at night at about 7PM. Riding a bike is nice but I’m also dang hungry all the time. while I do bring my own lunch and have extra food at my desk at work I am a bottomless pit. 

option 3. Drive to school. deal with paying for parking and might even have to drive around for a while to look for parking which is annoying. Drive to work then also end up having to deal with some traffic. then also parking at work at the hospital is atrocious. Get done with work and try to do homework. 

Basically my life is up at 6AM, try to dress myself (usually I work my work clothes anyway but there are days I wish I could just wear sweatpants), get to school by 7 (i try to give myself some time in case of a flat if I am riding my bike or traffic if I am driving), out of school by 10, get to work by 1030am, off work at 7pm then study until 11pm. Repeat.

Dethlateer,1547801805,/r/college/comments/ah8lln/how_do_you_go_into_college_and_still_thrive_under/,"TL;DR will be at the bottom.

Preface: I swear I'm not a weeb. Language has always interested me and it was a tossup between Russian and Japanese because I wanted a challenge. Picked Japanese because they made my childhood games and I dig the culture and always thought I'd be a dope as fuck teacher, so it all kinda fits. Something about leaving your homeland and making a sustainable life for yourself in a completely alien country appeals to me; I feel like if I could do that I could do anything in the world if I put my heart towards it.

This is gonna be a wordy story because the basis of my issue with college is depression and anxiety, so if I bum you out then leave. I try my best to chill with the digressions.

I got into the University of Arizona with like a fuckin 2.7 GPA or something. I'm not stupid, just suddenly got lazy once puberty hit, and depressed by the time I was out of highschool. But I digress. Kek.

I went there for basically a semester and stopped going to class a few weeks into the second one. I'd made the dumbest decision ever to pick a major immediately just because my buddy did. I picked Computer Science because I've always kinda been interested in computers and programming and games and shit, and so did he for the same reasons. Immediately half my classes are math and I hated myself already at this point but my grades were absolute dogshit and I realized I hated the impending math class more than I could ever dig computers. I end up dropping a math class, but too late so it counted as an F I'm pretty sure.

I switch majors to East Asian Studies. Japanese 101 was the first class I'd ever taken in my entire life that actually had me WANTING to go to school, I really was interested as fuck in doing this and was down with doing the English Teacher in Japan thing. But with the already F on my record I was beating myself up and gave up and stoppes doing most homework which is something I could get away with in highschool but not there. I did great on tests and quizzes, but that ain't enough so it seems.

After the first semester I had a 1.8 GPA. If I fucked up again I was going to lose my loans and pretty much have to drop out. The stress huge. I was already depressed and comparing myself to all these other people I see and thinking I don't deserve to be there and I'm a piece of shit wasting an opportunity while also putting myself in debt without getting anything out of it. I'd fully succumb to my procrastination and self hatred and just kinda hermitted out in my apartment. I stopped going to Biology, then I was skipping Nutrition, then I finally hated myself enough to stop kidding myself and just stopped going to the other two.

If I recall currectly I should have withdrawn in a way that won't count towards my GPA when I go back, but I'm still in debt for two semesters and have like 8k to go and can hardly make the payments even living with my parents and working 32ish hours a week.

My 22nd birthday is Monday. Having a bit of an existential crisis. I'm the only one from the ""smart"" nerdy group of kids from highschool that isn't going to school and isn't working towards any plans and is on track to being a total waste of air.

When I think back, I really did like college. If I had just done well in my classes, I'd not have to be so fucking stressed, but the blow that the Computer Science choice did to my GPA sent me into hardcore self-loathing mode and I gave up. But other than that, I had and have Japanese friends who are fantastic and would genuinely do everything in their power to help me pursue a life in Japan. I was part of the radio club and had my own metal show on the station on Fridays where I got to jam all my favorite songs (I love music), and I had music classes I was sorta planning to take along side everything because I'm a hobby musician.

That being said, I feel like the only way I'm ever going to be happy is if I try this again. Or even a trade school or some shit but I'd be hard pressed to find anything tooly I'd be interested in, mechanical shit never got me. But I'm already fucking 8k in debt and it fucking irks my soul hard.

I can't imagine going back there, getting a job (oh yeah did I mention I wasn't even fucking working at the time? I've held a job for over a year since so I've at least built a shred of discipline since then) that I'll probably hate that probably won't pay near enough for me to comfortably live there without parent carepackages (that eat my fucking soul. Makes me feel worthless), AND just be all like ""oh that 8k you were crying about? Its 14k now."" and be fucking OKAY with it and be able to function.

So how do you do it? How do you go to college with depression? How do you do it with anxiety over your debt and the years and years of payments you're burying yourself under, let alone what if you graduate and can't find a job right away or even a job in your field, let alone if worse happens and you struggle to make payments which in turn make you struggle just in day to day  life, worse case scenario?

I've never understood the people in college that seemed super happy and just stoked on life. Like what if you fuck up yo? What if something goes wrong? The debt can potentially pin you down for life. Why am I the only one that seems to be petrified by this? Is it because I didn't get in with scholarships and shit and just got the standard little grants everybody gets?

TL;DR: If you have depression and anxiety issues, how do you keep the looming debt from stressing you out and still function well enough to both work a job and go to college while still excelling academically?",college,How do you go into college and still thrive under the crippling fear and debt?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ah8lln/how_do_you_go_into_college_and_still_thrive_under/,1547823405.0,can't pay for school,7.193333333333333
Soph573,1429289925,/r/college/comments/32xwep/considering_changing_my_major_at_a_very/,"I'm a freshman at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a university which is very well-known in the airline and security industries as well as in some business circles and scientific communities. I'm currently studying Global Security and Intelligence Studies, which focuses on security, intelligence, business, language (I'm taking Arabic and I'm halfway done), and world geography and politics. The degree primarily will prepare you for work in three-letter agencies if you want to go the government route, but large aerospace companies like Boeing and Lockheed have been known to take quite a few GSIS graduates as well, plus everyone needs security experts. I've had a passion for security and protecting people ever since 9/11, and I work a security job back home that I've really enjoyed. This was my dream school, and the only school that I applied to (high schoolers, if you're reading this, don't do that. It's extremely stupid and risky, but I knew I would get in and the timing worked out perfectly so that's the only reason it worked out). 

I originally came here looking at their stellar aerospace engineering program, which is one of the best in the nation. I've been in engineering classes since 7th grade and science has always been probably my strongest and most intuitive subject. Engineering came very naturally and it seemed like the perfect thing to study in college. When I came here for a tour though, I got to sit in and experience a class dealing with the history of terrorism for GSIS, and I was hooked. I changed my incoming major from aerospace engineering to GSIS and hadn't looked back--until recently. 

Probably my longest-running passion (sometimes bordering on obsession) is with astronomy and physics. It's extremely empowering when you figure out for yourself how the fundamental forces of the universe come together and interact to create beautiful structures like nebulae, superclusters, galaxies, solar systems, and our gorgeous planet. I wanted to be an astronomer and an astronaut ever since I was a kid, but in high school I went through a phase where I thought that would never happen and there just wasn't a future in it, so I moved on. It was always nagging me at the back of my mind though, and we do have an excellent Space Physics program here that has been very successful. 

I have friends in Space Physics, and although the courseload can be very rough they were always happy and full of passion for the subject. In GSIS, the courseload can also be difficult in other ways, but a lot of the people are extremely competitive and negative. When you ask for help in Space Physics, everyone works together towards the same goal willingly, and there is a lot to be said about camaraderie in a small program. When you ask for help in GSIS, you are usually seen as weak and incompetent, even when the whole class can't do the problem. It's a mentality that can get very depressing after a while, and it's hard to stay motivated sometimes when you know you can't ask for help from your peers without being judged. GSIS people are usually very proactive A-type personalities as well, and I'm definitely not an A-type, but in the eyes of some that translates as weakness. I can still do all my work on a great level, but I'm not really the one to lead a group and call someone in the middle of the night to yell at them about a group project due in a month (true story). It's tiring when everyone around you is trying to outshine everyone else even though the program isn't as competitive as the STEM programs. Regardless, I'll be seeing the people from my school for the rest of my life since our industries are pretty well-connected, so good relationships will pay off. I feel like I fit in more with the astrophysicists, who are extremely happy about 90% of the time and are always willing to talk and help others out, whether it be for classes or with life in general. They are very tight-knit as a family due to the small number of them, but they are remarkably inclusive. I've already been welcomed ""into the family"" and even have access to the special building reserved for physics students called the Cave. Even if they end up competing for internships I have always seen them be very gracious if they don't get it and congratulatory if someone else finds the perfect internship. GSIS people can be very bitter about internships and the competitiveness carries over to nearly every aspect of life. 

If I switch to Space Physics though, I will have to go through at least eight years of grad school after my undergrad is completed, so the next ~12 years I will be in school working towards a doctorate. I feel like these are the best years of my life and I don't want to waste them, but if I'm working and passionate about what I'm doing, then I feel like I'll be happy for far longer. None of my classes aside from some history and English will carry over from my GSIS classes so I'll basically start off as a freshman again next year if I switch. I don't really have a problem with that though since I'll still minor in GSIS and Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies. Basically all I have to do is sign up for new classes and officially declare a new major. It's making a few clicks online and turning in a form, but I just want some second opinions. My family and friends are incredibly enthusiastic about the change and believe it's the right place for me, the Space Physics students are very excited to have a new family member, and the GSIS students looked at me like I was crazy and basically dismissed it. I think it's a good choice to do Space Physics, but it will change the course of my life. 

What do you think? 

TL;DR: I want to switch majors to something more science-based rather than security-based. Security people are generally not very welcoming or friendly and prefer competition, science people have great camaraderie and help each other out. If I stay with security, I do 3-4 years and go into the field, if I do science I'll have to go through grad school, so about ~12 more years. I love science and I'm lacking that in security.

mikailranjit,1530531504,/r/college/comments/8vhy02/ultimate_college_money_saving_guide/,"Hi just a bit of a background check on who I am, I'm a college student in the final year of my masters. I'm going to breakdown how I saved close to $14,000 over my last 3 years, keeping in mind I'm talking about life expenses, not college tuition fees.

Coffee:

College and coffee go hand in hand, most of our daily routines consists of a quick Starbucks run. However most of these coffee stores overcharge big time for coffee. The average coffee will cost around 20 cents to make in a chain franchise, but you pay $3.50. So if you have a cup of coffee 5 times a week. That's around $900 you spend in a year provided you only have 5 cups a week. However what you should do is make your own coffee at home every morning, buy some high quality coffee powder and for around 25 cups you pay around 20 dollars(provided you use something high end, cheaper obviously if you use those crappy 3-in-1's or some no name which equates to around $0.80 per cup of coffee. So if you were to use your at home coffee powder you would save close to $700 per year/ 5 cups of coffee per week.

Clothes:

Ok now during my early days in college I used to be big into jackets, like as a college student I would wear jackets and sweatpants everywhere I go, literally EVERYWHERE, whether that be to the mall, to meet my parents even to sleep. However in my head, spending $250 on a Nike Tech Fleece Combo was absurd at the time and what I did was end up buying about 4 jackets from Target and 4 sweatpants from Walmart, however I found that these clothes were often tearing on me and that after a few washes they felt like sandpaper. In total, over the span of my Freshman year I spent close to $1000 on jackets and sweatpants from different brands due to the fact that after just about two-three weeks of spending I would end up refusing to wear it because it just felt rubbish and used to LITERALLY tear my skin up. So what I did during my sophomore and junior year was, I bought three sets of Nike Tech Fleece, two from outlet stores for around $120 each and one set for $250 because it was brand new all-black color, and until today I am still using that, so I saved close to around $1500 on just sweatpants and jackets alone, and I used this same mentality for every other piece of clothing I bought ranging from t-shirts to socks, so I would estimate on clothes alone I would have saved at a minimum, $4000. And not to say I only buy quick fashion brands like Nike, you can still afford to buy the nice designer stuff and SAVE money for example, instead of buying ten pairs of jeans like most people do from True Religion or Uniqlo I just bought two pairs of YSL jeans off Grailed and saved a lot there and those jeans are perfect. 

Transport:

God gave you legs use them as much as you can. I'm being serious, okay if your house is a 20 minute walk from your college just WALK it. Seriously, a bus fair ticket or train ticket will cost you around $1.50. Now $1.50 there and another $1.50 back costs around $750 per year. Try your level best to walk and if it's really really far then walk as far as you can THEN take a bus or train so you can save as much as you can because now you're in college your income is limited. And on the days you go out with your friends try your best to ask for a carpool. Over the span of 3 years I would say I saved at a minimum $1500

Books:

NEVER buy new books and NEVER rent books too. If you can't find a free copy of your book online just find a used copy of it even if it has a bit of scribbles in it and if a PDF edition costs much less then I suggest you save for an iPad or something and bring that iPad everywhere you go since you can store your textbooks on that. I saved close to $3500 on textbooks, and that includes getting myself an iPad which also benefits me in other ways so it's a win-win

Recreational fun:

If you do what to have fun with your friends, NEVER bring a credit card. In fact try your best to never own a credit card, debit cards are safer because you have a limit. Whenever you are out with your friends, bring cash and cash only, and that's not too say bring all your cash, make sure you budget yourself based on your financial situation. If you receive only $300 from your parents monthly, don't be stupid and bring $150 in one serving with your friends. I myself have a tendency of spending like there's no tomorrow when I'm not given a limit so doing this probably saved me a lot more then I would like to comfortably admit.

Healthcare:

Get insurance. PERIOD, it will benefit you if anything happens and although it may cost a fair amount try your best to go for the BEST insurance possible as you really could potentially save tens of thousands just by doing that, seriously I have a friend who because she did not have insurance had to pay close to $50,000 for surgery that a simple $200 monthly insurance would have covered.

Haircuts, Tattoos and Piercings:

Before I came to college I was perfectly clean, had a decent haircut, no piercings and no tattoos. By the time I left I had 4 stomach tattoos, one leg tattoo and one chest tattoo. And two piercings, overall this cost me a lot of money because I went to some of the most established tattoo artists all across the US such as Romeo Lacoste and etc. Because a one time high investment for something that will be on me until I die will costs a lot less then getting it from a shady tattoo artists and paying about $3000 for laser surgery when I regret it in two months time. 

Overall that's a guideline, I can always do a part 2. Just remember, more for less isn't always better than less for more.",college,ULTIMATE COLLEGE MONEY SAVING GUIDE,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8vhy02/ultimate_college_money_saving_guide/,1530553104.0,can't afford tuition ,7.18
long_shot,1298388295,/r/AskReddit/comments/fqbco/can_i_ask_you_help_me_get_a_job_in_digital/,"I’d like to move from where I am right now, but I need a job for that to happen. I’m in the advertising industry and maybe you can help me out.

I live in South America at the moment and used to work at an advertising agency as an account director until I quit a few days ago. I’m financially stable, but I always wanted to get something from this job that I never got and it makes me itchy to try something new and see if that changes. I’ve had some offers by other agencies, but if I’m going to try something new, it might as well be now.

I’m a digital person, so my background is in digital advertising. In Latin America, people think digital advertising is entirely composed of websites and banners. Pitching a different idea that includes other digital elements is a waste of time. We’ve had good ideas at the agency, some of them worthy of submitting to respected awards, but we’ve never been able to execute them because our market is not ready for them or because they are too expensive.

I’ve seen international brands reject an idea because of the cost of making it happen and then jump in a co-branded venture with someone else because a family member of the boss works with that other brand. Normally, I’d understand this but it has happened with brands that have huge differences and that talk to very different market segments. I’ve witnessed numerous focus groups by well-respected international research agencies where people say that they don’t understand the relationship between those brands or why they’re even working together and they still go for it, year after year. I have countless stories like these.

You might ask yourself why this financially stable guy that had a good job and even has job offers wants to move from where he is. There are two answers to that: Latin American average mindset for the marketing industry and the market itself. Allow me to explain.

I used to work with big brands. In fact, if you live in the US or Europe you or someone you know have used these brands in one way or another as I handled both mass consumption and services accounts. The problem is that they are all managed by Latin American brand and marketing managers. I find it extremely frustrating that these people always go for the safer choice. I’m tired of doing the same things for them. They loved them and praised our “excellent creativity” (something I couldn’t believe given what we had taken to that meeting), but it is not what I got into this industry for.

Regarding the market, Latin America is a region that is always behind technological advancements. I’m not talking about particle accelerators here. I’m referring to simple things like smartphone usage or even availability of newer techy gadgets (like the iPad or the Kindle) that open up doors for digital admen like me. We’re simply always lagging behind other countries in this area.

Don’t get me wrong. Even though I was born in Europe I consider myself Latin American. I’m very proud of innumerable things of our culture, just not the ones in the previous two paragraphs. I grew up in different parts of this region and have lived most of my life in it, but I feel I need to try new things.

The point of all this is that I want to move either to the US or Europe and try working for those markets and see how it goes.  Being European it should be easier to work there as far as immigration goes, but I’ve always wanted to work for the US market as well.

I’m a well-educated person and can read/write/speak perfect English and Spanish. I have a United States accent on my English (most Americans say I look and talk like someone from California) and I’m very passionate about what I do. I also have a strong work culture which some of my friends criticize when they say I work too much (some of them hate their jobs :P). I’m responsible, diligent, open-minded, and a nice person. I don’t have a criminal record anywhere and don’t do drugs.

As I said earlier, my background is in digital advertising, specifically in account handling, but I’ve also done my fair share of creative work for both digital and traditional media. I’m not an engineer, but I know enough about most things with a circuit board on them to be able to use them in a brainstorm.

I’m more than willing to do phone or Skype interviews. If you happen to be in Miami or nearby, I’m planning a trip there very soon so we can meet in person, no strings attached.

Additionally, I’m able to relocate myself and settle in at my expense. All I need is a job at an established agency to justify it.

Here’s an email address I’ve set up for this: digital.man@hushmail.com

**Can you help me out in any way to make this happen? I know this is a long shot, but I’ve seen Reddit do a lot more than this :)**


Here are some random facts about me, related or non-related to all of this:

I’m a certified private pilot (I love aviation!)

I’m a fairly decent drummer and I play some guitar and bass. (I once passed on a scholarship to Berklee when I was 18.)

I’ve visited practically all the American continent (except Canada, Belize, Suriname, and Guyana as well as the smaller Caribbean islands), most of western Europe (except Portugal, Ireland, and Scotland), and several cities in the following states: Florida, Texas, California, New York, Hawaii, and Georgia.

I once worked at a factory in a European country where I didn’t speak or understand the language. (it was a lot of fun!)

Back in 1996 or 1997 I made my high school’s first website when the head of the computer department discovered me coding HTML for my band’s website during class. Shortly after that, I landed my first job in the IT department of a company where I built their website on a Sun workstation using Solaris OS.

I was kicked out of middle school because someone sent me a naked picture of Pamela Anderson while exploring IRC (remember IRCle?)

I’m a decent cook and my friends often invite themselves to my house to eat.

not_its_father,1581272076,/r/college/comments/f1ciq8/rant_about_college/,"Why am I paying the professors salary just for them to force me to buy a fucking access code shit software that auto grades and makes content for them? Professors don't do anything anymore.

I have a professor that does not teach jack shit. ~160 kids in this class, there's only 2 TAs and 1 prof. The purpose of this class is to do all the work on your own outside of class, then show up for questions. How the fuck am I supposed to ask questions if there's 159 other kids raising their hands asking questions? I swear to fuck I spend the entire class with my hand raised waiting for a TA to show up. I send emails and they don't get answered. The best resource is other students. 

I have another prof, she is the ONLY professor who teaches a specific class which is required for my degree. There is no other option. I had an online (auto graded) assignment marked wrong, I sent her proof that I was right, and I didn't get a reply. I come into class *6 fucking days later* and confront her, and I asked ""did you receive my email or did I send it to the wrong person?"" and she says she got it but didn't read it. Well okay, a day or two or 3 is understandable. A fucking *week* later and still no reply (and no reply to this day, 10 days later) is fucking absurd. My grade still hasn't changed.

I had another professor 2 semesters ago (spring 2019), and once again, I got an answer marked wrong that was correct. Emailed this lady and she replied standing by her typo and told me tough shit, you still got it wrong. This is for a programming quiz (data structures). A typo is the difference between right at wrong. ""quizBank"" is NOT the same as ""quziBank"", those are 2 completely fucking separate variables. She ignored all further emails, which I made very polite because my grade is in this woman's hands. This lady did not do anything at all except 1 quiz a week based on zybooks. The midterm and final were proctored, not by the school, so we had to pay out of pocket to take our fucking exams. $60 I wasn't expecting to pay, which isn't too bad, but why the fuck do I have to pay for that? There's no resources on campus for proctored exams? Fucking seriously? I can say I learned absolutely nothing at all about data structures but still somehow got a B. Fuck you [removed], you're fucking lazy and absolutely useless. Google her and check out that fantastic rate my professor rating. Edit I changed my mind on putting her name.

Financial aid. I met with a financial aid bursar lady fall 2018 who was reluctantly helpful. She sighed and sounded annoyed that she found me a $500/semester grant. Great! Any little bit helps, thank you! I only got this grant for 1 year. Last year, spring 2019, I went to meet with her only to find out she doesn't meet with students anymore. Neither does anyone in financial aid. Their whole office was relocated to another building. So I go and find out *other STUDENTS* are now handling finances. Fantastic, what's better than a barely paid 19 year old handling my finances? Them bullshitting every fucking question I ask them. They don't know the fucking answers. I call them out and say it's okay to say you don't know something, but don't fucking spread misinformation, especially on something that cost me $1000 a year and other students thousands as well. Fuck you. Now that grant I had is seemingly ""lost"", I can't meet with anyone over the age of 20, and I'm genuinely fucking annoyed. Some of these kids want to be helpful, but it's like they're trained to tell you whatever answer comes off the top of their fucking head at that moment. ""hmmmm *I think* it's because -blahblahbullshitanswer-."" I've almost had to drop out on multiple occasions due to a lack of money. I got denied every federal and private loan. I applied for around 6 private loan companies. Federal is determined by the financial aid office, except parent plus which I was denied on with both my parents. My credit is great, 730, I've had an auto loan for $35k and I paid it off entirely (and my credit dropped because now my average age of credit is lower lmfao) and apparently that doesn't mean shit. My parents have $300,000 and $40,000 in student loans for my sister's private college loans, so I can't get money, my younger brother went to the military because he can't get help and had no money of his own, and now my younger sister who's still in HS doesn't believe me when I say she has to work, make money like I did, and pay your own way through college as you go. There is no money or loans that will magically appear. Just as you scrape by to pay the tuition by the due date, you're fucked in the ass with $400 in access codes and out of pocket housing / food costs. 

Back to access codes. Nearly every professor requires zybooks, Pearson mylab, wiley plus, or some other dog shit software that the students are required to pay for. Why are we paying the university and then paying a 3rd party to do our homework? These companies are determining the fucking prices. If the prof says ""we're using zybooks, this is the code"", there is *No. Other. Choice*. You are forced to pay whatever zybooks/pearson/wiley/whoever says you gotta pay. $60? $90? $120?? Pay it or fail. Textbooks are no longer as widely used because kids pirate them because they're charging $200 for a fucking textbook. What is the fucking incentive for these professors to be using this software? Zybooks is absolute shit. Complete one section, get to the next, and all the answers from last section are gone. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong. There is no learning going on here. It's only useful for information, but it even fucking sucks at that because it doesn't go in depth on anything.

Fakethrowaway2k17,1484785468,/r/college/comments/5otaha/25_year_old_starting_college_back_up_after_25/,"Very long wall of text...

I suffered from severe depression and just lost myself these past few years, I was nothing but a shell. Stayed with a mentally abusive girlfriend for almost 2 of those years and just forgot who I was. I technically dropped out after spring semester of 2014. I'm majoring in Biology traditional track at a County College and hopefully going for my bachelor's after that. I left school because there was simply too much going on for me to deal with, family fighting all the time when I got home, money problems to pay rent constantly, my ex-gf and I also fighting and I just gained a boatload of weight and felt like I had nothing to live for.

 The part I'm kicking myself the most about is that that spring semester was one of my best, I only had maybe 3 more classes left after that but I got a D in one class(Chemistry 2 Lecture) and just gave up. I originally was a pretty bad student, after my first year I got a 2.0 and was having trouble keeping up but then I said ""Fuck it, what do I have to lose if I try my hardest and fake it till I make it"" and eventually my grades started to go back up and ended up with a 3.0 my spring semester. That spring semester I was part of the executive staff for the student gov, part of college council, head chair for al clubs in my school and everyone came to me for questions, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was on a scholarship and getting that meant that I would be on academic probation. Then fall semester came around, I started to focus more on my gf at the time because she had mental health issues(abused, problems with physcially abusive mom/ex bf) that she had to deal with and just got scared to apply for fall semester then since I saw all of my friends transferring and I just felt like the biggest failure out of anyone I know. 

    Then spring 15 came around and I still didn't apply again... I stopped emailing my scholarship guy even though he emailed me, I never checked my emails out of fear and severe anxiety didn't bother keeping in touch with him since I was afraid of knowing whether or not I'd lose my scholarship over it. I'm usually that big guy with a big smile always on his face who likes to joke around with his friends and is always ready to help, I didn't want anyone to feel bad for me so I pretty much faked that smile for 2.5 years. I love motivating people and getting them to feel better about themselves, it's one of the few things that truly make me happy. I just couldn't motivate myself to get past that anxiety and depression though, I was stuck.

Fall 15 comes and goes by, then spring 16(finally broke up with my ex) and then finally Fall 16, I think about it and the days for registering comes so I finally gather up the courage to go register for classes on the first day of school but apparently after the first day of classes happen you can't pick them up anymore and you can only drop them( previous policy allowed to pick up classes up to 10 days after classes start) I just had a panic attack and left. I was depressed and anxious for a week, my life was in shambles. 

By this time I'm dating another girl who's 22 extremely supportive, intelligent and very happy and is almost done with her psych degree from a very difficult school. We're both from the east coast and she's going to school in the west, she inspired me so much when she let me visit her at her school and I just got a little spark under my ass. I can't wait around any longer, I want a life with her and I want a life for myself. I need to be successful, I need to be the old me, but the best version of me again. I want to have a family, have a career in medicine and buy my mom a house where she can retire to, take care of my older brother if he ever loses a job or is going through something tough. I feel like a failure right now, at my rock bottom but I needed to get my ass up and go apply for spring 17, I got in contact with my scholarship guy( extremely hesitant to speak to me again) but eventually met with me. I told him everything that was going on and has been nothing but a positive influence to me this whole time and I'm extremely grateful for that. 

My gf is working hard and motivates me to do better too, I decided to finally give it a try again and found out that I'm only 3-4 FUCKING CLASSES AWAY FROM GRADUATING WITH MY ASSOCIATES IN BIO. I was ecstatic, I couldn't believe it so I finally applied. I work full-time so decided to go and take 2 classes(technically 3 with lab) only since I'm moving out this may and needed money still. I finally went back to class this morning for the first time and got destroyed with all of this new information. I have to take genetics and genetics lab as well as chem 2 lecture and it's so much information, I used to be great at bio and remember some stuff but we had to take a quiz to see where we're at and I'm sure I got a 20 on it today. I felt miserable after, disgusted with myself and now I don't know what to do. The professors are awesome but I feel bad bothering them for help, I don't have a car so it's difficult coming to their hours as well. I just needed to share this with someone since I'm terrible at sharing my problems with people out of fear of disappointment and people just leaving me.

Where do I start? I used to be awesome at studying but this is truly scaring me. It's a whole lot of information until my next monday class... Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.

ThePaulitician,1472744092,/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

I also am very not looking forward to making the trip to the advising office to talk about this. I'm not looking forward to the ""Are you sure? UCF is a great place to be!"" speech.

Lowkey_HatingThis,1579927369,/r/college/comments/etm9fz/had_really_good_highschool_scores_and_a_first/,"NY state if it matters. So I graduated #10 in a class of 80 in highschool, I came out with a GPA of like 94/100 I think? Idk its been a while. I had an SAT of 1410 and an ACT of 28, but the ACT I only took once. I had AP classes throughout highschool, but only took test for 4, the APUSH, which I got a 5 on, the AP English, which I got a 4 on, The AP BC Calculus, which I got a 2 on with a subscore of 3 for the AB test (so I failed the main one but just passed the part of the test that was graded on AB content, which didn't include series and sequences and polar functions), and a 2 in the AP chem test. Technically, I did get the best scores in my grade on the calculus and chem, because I was the only one in my graduating class who took them that year. Needless to say the teachers for those classes didn't prepare as well for just one kid. 

My point is, I worked hard in high school and I thought I did pretty okay. I got into a nice school and at like 20% of the cost. I went for physics, and had a pretty good first semester, a couple A's, a few B's, and a D, in my one physics course. I had a 3.2 gpa I think

Then it started to go downhill. There was a whole mix of problems, my home life with an alcoholic, my lack of interest in my major, constant personal money issues that I had to work two part time jobs over for a while, and ultimately my gf breaking up with me during finals of my second semester. My second semester I got a B in one class, a C in another, then all F's. My third semester I got all F's, didn't show up to a single final. Eventually I just stopped coming to classes. 


Here's a bit of back story about my mental state at the time and the impact it had on my performance in school, skip this paragraph to get to my question:

My mental state at the time was wrecked. A bit on my situation, I grew up from 10 years old until I moved out with an verbally and sometimes physically abusive step dad, who isolated me emotionally from my family, and my mother who had let it go on so long I didn't really trust or love her anymore. I had no love in the world except my girlfriend at the time, who I dated for a year and a half. Still, I wanted a family connection, so much went to live with my dad, who made more than enough money to pay the remainder of my tuition ($15k at a $60k school), but was a mean, vindictive, and mentally unstable alcoholic. I knew he was bad, I lived with him on weekends before, but living in the same house permanently was hell. He drunkenly accused me of taking his pain meds during my first semester mid terms. He called me vile names I won't type out. Anyways, he was as bad as my stepfather, I was crushed and depressed. Eventually, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my fault, I had cheated on her at some point early in our relationship, and then lied a lot after that about partying. I loved her, I really did, cheating on her was a disgusting thing I did in a drunken blackout that I just can't live with myself for doing.She stayed with me for a year after that, I didn't cheat again, but she didn't want me out partying, and even tho I didn't often, every once in a while I'd sneak off and lie. Eventually sheeft and that was it, I had no contact with her anymore and when I tried to establish a friendship I could feel her lack of love or care towards what I had to say. Watching her face light up when I talked about something was the one thing of any worth I had left and I really didn't realize how bad depression could be until she was gone. I went into my third semester destroyed and unmotivated, and I just stopped showing up, got literal straight F's.  I spent the entirety of 2019 on academic suspension, getting high and working odd jobs. 



Anyways, my question is, will college's give a fuck. If I have high school scores from 2016-2017 that show I'm not a fuck up, will they give my troubles any merit, or will they just see the two awful semesters and turn me down?I want to apply to film school, even if everything was emotionally fine with me I still would have not liked physics, it was just work I wasn't interested in doing, not so much that it was hard and I struggled. But I've also had a passion for film and have recently been writing a screenplay and exploring photography. I even have an A in an intro to film class from my college first semester, which may be my best evidence of being able to do well in a film corriculum. 

My goal for now is to apply to a school I could get at like $10-$15k a year, which I think I could do for a lot of SUNY schools, I'm back living with my mom and her husband, who make less than $90k a year combined, my mom is actually unemployed, so I'd probably get a lot of financial aid benefits. I also want to go live on campus housing, I can't take it living here anymore, even if I have to pay a lot more a year for a dorm or something I'm fine with it. I want to get my gpa back up and get to 60 credits, I have 30 now at most, then apply to a nicer school I know won't accept me now, like a school in LA or NYC (I live in upstate), if I was freshly graduating I think I may have had a decent shot, but I'll be more realistic about my situation until I get my GPA up.

bl1y,1563549366,/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",college,I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,1563570966.0,can't pay for school,7.08
p_U_c_K,1339502796,/r/AskReddit/comments/uxt8f/describe_the_moment_where_you_realized_a_friend/,"I had reconnected with a friend I grew up with not too long ago. He was always kind of an experimenter, tried different things but never more than once or twice (that I knew of), smoked a shit load of weed though. He kind of fell off the map when his mom got really sick (cancer) and ended up dying, this was around when we were both 16 or 17.

I saw him briefly in college, he didn't go to school, frankly none of my friends did, but I did have a house on campus and they'd all come by to take advantage of the parties. Even then I'd ""catch"" him doing coke here or there with random people we didn't know (I saw catch because I'd drunkly walk into a room, in my own house mind you (I mean, MY ROOM) during a party with atleast 100 people (New Years, Halloween, the house was huge, old as shit, duplex, we had both levels and a basement carved out of limestone (hooray for radon!), I built a bar down there in this creepy section where steps went up to the bottom part of a full door (someone built that cut the door off halfway up, but )in the crack you could still see the rest of the door, I used to have HORRIBLE nightmares about that shit, like, other thread necessitating nightmares, I'm happy that's how I describe things now.. God, I have to go outside) anyway, when I'd walk into the room he'd be holding a straw or rolled up dollar (this happened a couple times with coke or oxy) and he'd be like ""FUCK, I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" and it was really, really awkward because A) I really didn't give a fuck and B) he was doing shit with random people, girls including, and it just looked like I was his conservative boyfriend or something, like ""HENRY, YOU LYING, GOOD FOR NOTHING! *pulls out rolling pin*, SO THIS IS YOUR ""LATE MEETING""?!?!?!). But, I was a giant alcoholic (literally, and a terrible, mean, break shit and get jumped drunk) so I was like, who am I to judge? Or more like ""Whoer erm E to Jurge you ugl..hic..ugly bithhhh!! *smashes antique clock*). 

Anyway, after college I got a regular job and his mom had been dead for awhile (like 5 years). I did know that at that point he had been stealing her pain meds, and had a problem with those temporarily (which was why he disappeared, different crowd), but from what I heard he was clean now (his dad freaked out because basically everything his dead wife owned was pawned, jewelry (including wedding band, engagement ring), clothes, old perfume bottles etc.) and we started hanging out like the good old days. He was still smoking weed, but seemed normal to me. But, I had recently lost my job and was completely out of control booze wise. So he usually had to keep me from getting killed (sometimes literally), and would drive me to pick up girls I somehow sleazed off of facebook while blacked out (I had to stop him from doing that after awhile). Anyway, we started having more people over at my house and most of the time I'd black out really early (from drinking all day) and wake up and see random evidence of shit (burnt tin foil, bags, dead people in my bath tub) but figured, as long as people aren't yelling at me about last night... I'm happy. 

Anyway, final paragraph time. Time to reiterate my hypothesis! So, he actually started drinking more, and for not being a drinker, I was surprised how much he could drink, I actually couldn't believe how long he could drink (i'd black out, fall asleep, wake up, he'd still be up with girls, drinking, I'd drink again, fall asleep, wake up, same thing). He finally admitted he had been doing coke for awhile, but it was too expensive... so... STOP METH TIME. 

I lied about the last paragraph part. So, I was like, okay, well dude, that shit is no joke, take it easy. He said he did it like once or twice a month tops, and that was it. Being in a drunken haze I didn't think much of it until one night he was just freaking out. Asking me for $100, trying to pawn shit, just all out panic mode. I had the money but didn't feel comfortable giving it to him since he never had much money and I had no job. So, in front of me, he just pops this giant white head on his forehead... ugh... puts the pus on tin foil, AND SMOKES IT. I was like (after throwing up bacardi and red bull all over my own face), what the what what? And he was like ""YOU WOULDN'T FUCKING HELP ME DUDE AND METH COMES OUT THROUGH YOUR PORES, SO, IT'S A RESI HIT.. OKAY?"" 

I was like, um... I'm worried about you and he gave me the old, you're a fucking drunk retort to which I said, yes, but I'm not aiming my dick at my face in the morning to cure my hangovers (AND IF I WANTED TO I COULD BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BIG AND THE STREAMS ARE HEALTHY IN PRESSURE AND WIDTH)... So... yeah... 

So that's my story. We're not friends no more. He stole a bunch of my stuff one night after I got sober (17 months, bing bang boom), he was over after discovering that you could DL demo's on xbox live and I was tired so I went upstairs to sleep and woke up to a missing 360, ps3, ipod etc (I found out months later he had been in my room stealing shit for awhile, mostly old jewelry from my ex). He tried to make up an excuse, but after 20 minutes of contradicting himself and using the ""how dare you!"" defense he cried, I yelled and he never came around again. 

Your turns.

TL;DR- Thank god this was before bath salts, and it my story was too long, ignore it, post yours, or leave. That's how this works.

sdls,1336575937,/r/AskReddit/comments/tert2/i_have_severed_my_relationship_with_my_parents/,"I don't want this situation to hurt my marriage or my kids. Please read if you're interested in commenting. Sorry it's so long.

When I was 5, my single Mother married a guy (stepfather, I'll call him SD) and brought my older Sister and myself into a new family. He did well for himself, but was not a Father at all. He regularly beat us, but he provided us with a nice house and food on the table. He was a condescending prick (still is) who has no concept of family and only really got married because that's what good Italian Catholics are supposed to do.

They had 2 more kids (my younger Brothers). They were raised with love and affection from both parents. Their colleges were paid for (one of them took 7 years to get through), while I had to drop out in my second year because I could not afford to pay my own way. My Sister never went to college.

I was kicked out of the house at 17. My Sister was kicked out when she was 16. My Brothers enjoyed my Parents' big home and nice neighborhood through college, and then got apartments paid for when they wanted to move out.

I'm no angel, but I have always owned my problems. I had bad grades in High school, I dopped out of my University, and I had 2 kids in my early 20's with 2 different Moms. I never did drugs, or even smoked. No run-ins with the law either. I just lived my life on my own and never asked for anything. My Sister, on the other hand, asked for a lot and squandered several offerings from my parents (about $30,000 total). I trained myself in my field and built my own career. I'm very self-sufficient. Not rich, but I pay my bills.

My SD became very rich, becoming a partner in his company. I estimate he is worth around $100 Million. When the time came, my younger Brothers inherited about 20 Million each from the people that I was told to call Grandpa and Grandma (SD's parents). SD was in charge of their finances and essentially saw this as an opportunity to let them cash in. 

I went to counseling with my Mother about a year ago to try to get over the feelings of resentment I have for my parents. The counselor (My Mom's regular counselor) pretty much told me that I'm suffering from abuse anxiety and that I should not feel like less of a person just because my SD promoted that all my life. My Mother felt uncomfortable with us talking about him without him there and wanted him to attend, but the sessions ended before that happened. 

My Mother is not a ""bad"" person. She is just ignorant. I often describe her as ""paving the road to hell""; she always has the best of intentions, but fails to understand the implications of her so-called goodwill. 

About 2 years ago, my Mother offered me $100,000 to buy a house. I live in an expensive area (California) and that's barely a down payment. I did not ask for this, but I accepted because I figured I'd never have a house any other way. My Wife and I bought a small, run-down place in an OK neighborhood with good schools. We are likely in the bottom 5% of the homes for our elementary school district. Within 2 years, my Brothers bought insanely nice homes (like, REALLY nice). And one of them bought himself a new SUV and a new 5-series for his wife. Neither of them work. My other Brother bought a 3,500 sq ft home at the top of a hill overlooking San Francisco Bay near Marin. 

This was a ""last straw"" for me. When I saw that house, I just couldn't take it anymore and I stopped contact with my parents. I have not spoken to them in about 8 months. I do not answer when they call, and I do not appear at family functions if they are there. I still have contact with my Brothers because they did not cause this situation and I don't feel like it's their fault. My Sister stopped talking to my parents years ago.

I lost my job, and my wife was just laid off. We have a meager savings and we are not in danger of losing the home, at least for now. We do not ask for, and were not offered, any assistance from anyone except for unemployment insurance. My Wife's parents offer to help often, but they are not wealthy and we refuse to share our burden with them. They are wonderful people, and they taught me what parents really can be.

My wife wants me to get back into contact with my parents. Not for money, and not for any kind of support. She thinks that our 2 kids are missing out on a relationship with their Grandparents because of my issues. I just don't want my kids to go through what I went through. They already have a relationship with my parents (from before I ""left""), but that has pretty much ceased to exist in the last 8 months. The kids don't really miss my parents, as my parents were always traveling and rarely spent time with the kids. 

My Wife wants me to up-front tell my parents that it's over and that I am essentially leaving the family. I don't want to do that right before Mother's day (I feel like that's kind of a dick move), but I have no problem with doing it after. From what I hear my Mom cries a lot, just like she always has when things are sad, but nothing has changed. Shit - I don't know what I'd even ask for if a change was offered. I don't want the money, I just want respect from them and that's something I know I'll never have.

Am I out of line here? Should I allow my kids to know my parents? Should I re-initiate contact with them? I don't feel like I should, but perhaps my anger and sadness are clouding my judgement. 

I appreciate all constructive replies.

tl;dr - It's too complicated to summarize IMHO. Please read if you want to comment. Sorry it's so long.",AskReddit,"I have severed my relationship with my parents. They mistreated me all my life, but my Mother is a sweet lady who is passive. I hate her for allowing her ignorance to hurt me and my family.

Iuvrgirl360,1668633370,/r/college/comments/yx6hoi/im_so_sick_of_my_roommate/,"i am literally AT MY LAST STRAW with my roommate. i don’t give a fuck if i sound like a piece of shit anymore, i genuinely can’t stand her anymore. she’s the most insufferable person i’ve ever had to be with. 

first of all she’s the messiest person i’ve seen in my life. i’m living with three people, in total 4 people in one room. me and my two other roommates are relatively clean; we keep our side of the room tidy. meanwhile her stuff covers the floor; her stuffed animals, trash, her clothes, literally it’s all her shit. she leaves food on her desk too, which stinks up the room. her desk area is a fucking mess too, and it doesn’t help that my desk is right next to hers so her stuff ends up near my desk. i’m so over it that i just kick her stuff over to her side if i find it on mine. one time she left a drying rack full of clothes out for DAYS and it drove everyone insane because it was blocking everyone’s access to their beds by taking up the space in between the bunk beds. i find her clothes on MY bed too and when i told her about it, she was like “oh it must’ve fallen from my bed” HOW would it have fallen. how. when your bed is the same size as mine theres no way it could have fallen. you’re just trying to cover up the fact that when you change you leave your clothes on my bed and leave it there. the lack of consideration for others and self awareness is BEYOND me. you are living with three other people, and you’re acting like our room is just yours. we are paying just as much money to stay in this room as you are, the least you can do is tidy up your own space. 

ok now moving on from the fact that she’s a messy ass person; she’s a slut. i mean it. this girl is pimping herself out to make money, and in doing so she sexiles me and my roommates. it’s so annoying because she’ll tell us in the group chat to stay out of the room with a 5 minutes notice of us coming back to our dorm because some guy is coming over. and this will be at like 10-11pm. some of us have homework to do? some of us want to sleep? hello? some of us have early morning classes and don’t want to wait for you to get done fucking. i already feel uncomfortable with the fact that there’s old men in our dorm room doing ungodly activities. it feels gross, and it’s literally unsafe for guys like that to be in our room. there’s condom wrappers all over the floor too when i get back. she also does onlyfans and tells us to get out while she films her videos. one time i got back from the library late at night because i spent the whole day studying. i just wanted to sleep. i get back to my dorm, the bitch is naked under her covers and sheepishly tells me if i can leave the room. that sparked a rage i never knew i had. i slammed the door as i left, i was FUMING. 

furthermore, she NEVER. wakes up. to her alarm. her alarm goes off for at least 10 minutes, waking everyone else up but her. she won’t turn it off unless someone wakes up (which is usually me) and tells her to shut it off. but she snoozes it instead of turning it off. which repeats the cycle of her not waking up to her alarm and me having to wake up AGAIN and tell her to turn it off. what’s the point of setting an alarm for 7:00 for an 8am class when you end up sleeping until 8 anyways. she had the audacity to ask me to wake her up if she doesn’t wake up for her class, because i wake up at 7:30 to get ready for my 9 am. girl no, that’s not my responsibility. YOU wake up. i’m not the one who has an 8 am, and i’m not going to waste MY time in the morning trying to wake YOU up when i want to relax, do my skincare, do my makeup, and eat breakfast. 

finally, as if it couldn’t get any worse, my roommate snores. i know it’s not in her control, but it’s so incredibly obnoxious when i want to sleep. i had two midterms last week, in which i wanted to get a good night’s sleep, and i barely got a wink because this girl was snoring as if she’s an obese man. she’s in the bunk directly above me, so i hear her all night. i tried wearing earplugs. and i can still hear her snoring. my other roommate has also said she barely gets sleep sometimes because her snoring is so loud. i’ve been so sleep deprived lately because of it and it’s genuinely affecting my mental health. i get anxiety everyday before bed because i know i won’t be able to sleep with her snoring. i feel really drained and exhausted throughout the day, and i just don’t know what to do. the roommate situation plus my academics is really giving me so much stress. 

she tells me she does only fans and sex work because she doesn’t have brought in savings to pay for school (she’s an out of state student). i feel sorry that she feels the need to turn to sex work for that, but at the same time, she’s just being so inconsiderate of everyone else. also, if you can’t afford the school, why would you go. the irony is that she spends so much money on alc yet she complains about not being able to afford tuition. i chose my school at the moment because 1. i could afford it and 2. it has great academics. i turned down one of my dream schools because it was too expensive, so why couldn’t she do the same thing. college is literally not worth all that money. 

tldr; i have an inconsiderate, slutty, messy roommate who also snores like an obese man. send help please.",college,i’m so sick of my roommate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/yx6hoi/im_so_sick_of_my_roommate/,1668654970.0,school is too expensive,7.04
OldOpportunity7492,1656306701,/r/college/comments/vlnpl8/feeling_incompetent_and_worthless/,"Hello. So this is a very raw, very insecure wall of text. I need advice on my very desperate situation. 

So i was a very good student all throughout high school. Good with maths, physics, biology. 

In the 2nd semester of 11th grade, quarantine hit. I stopped studying all together thinking I'm finally free from studying. 

I start painting again and keep doing it instead of studying.

I become pretty good at it, take commissions and such. Start seeing potential in taking commissions in dollars because USD is expensive in my country, and if i worked as an artist consistently I'd make better money than engineers and some doctors in my country (they're awfully underpaid, when you convert it to dollars. An average artists pay in dollars is much higher. So if i am paid by people who use USD I'm paid higher.)

I of course choose painting over studying again. I always knew I had no interest in any academic major, and hated studying despite being one of the top students. Just knew that I'd choose engineering if i had to choose one. So, easily i choose painting over that hell hole of stress and sleepless nights. Because I have a rough estimate of how it's gonna be based on my high school experience. Procrastination, laziness, stress, getting good grades but still feeling aimless. 

Here comes the university entrance exams, I'm delirious because I didn't study at all for the most important exam ever in someone's academic life. 

Get a pretty low score, it was expected though. It was all calculated. I would go into a major that pays well despite being easy to get into and easy to study, teaches valuable things etc. (Economy and finance) doesn't take too much of my time so I can spend more time drawing. And I would guarantee a 4 year university diploma by the time I'm 22, and maybe be successful in arts both level wise and financial wise. 

If i were to actually study for it though, and gotten a grade that i usually get in school, i would've chosen engineering, STEM. and I know I would've gotten it. 

But it just wasn't possible because of life circumstances (family being neck deep in depth, trying to make money from art so we could survive, telling me ""there's already an engineer in the family, becoming a doctor doesn't suit you, becoming a veterinarian doesn't shit you, what are you gonna do, stick a hand up a cows ass?""), and deciding to do art. 

Ever since i have gotten into the major I've been feeling highly insecure. I've been feeling sad to notice my scientific skills evaporate. I am aware that economics and finances is just not an impressive major. And I don't think it suits me at all. I know that I can get into a much better major, but people don't know. They assume im dumb and I hate it. I can see their energy change when i tell them i study economy and finance. I've even had a taxi driver tell me ""ew, what are you gonna do with that major? It's pointless.""  I hate it when people ask me what major I'm in or how much i scored on the entrance exam. I dread it. And it makes me angry because I don't deserve to feel this. I'm a good student, I'm smart, I'm hardworking. So why do I feel these things? Fuck. 

I'm starting to go practically insane. I'm considering retaking the exam to get into an engineering major that i know I won't enjoy, just to let people know that I'm not stupid. I feel people don't see my excellence in high school and how I was easily passing their architecture major daughter that they've been bragging about for 2 hours and comparing me to her. I don't like it.

People automatically assume my IQ is low. It's getting really irritating. I've not met my expectations in any area. Despite being a professional in art, despite having the highest gpa in my faculty across all business majors. I cannot feel satisfied and it makes me really sad. 

I hate being in the same major as people who couldn't care less to study. People who get all up in my DMS to ask for notes and how to solve a problem. 

It makes me feel like i wasted my academic potential. 

In terms of money, I'm good on that department, for sure. I make decent money from art. I've learned to crypto trade and make accurate observations (please don't make jokes about crypto-bro business major student, i cannot take it at the moment. Maybe later.) 

But i just cannot overcome this suffocating sense of INCOMPETENCY. 

So i look for solutions and one of them that is harder to solve is retaking the uni entrance exam. 

Okay, let's say I took it. I studied for a year (will reduce the time i spend drawing, learning to crypto trade etc.) Let's say I won the major in a good school. 

The score you get on these exams only last for a year, if it passes that then you'd have to retake the exam again. 

So let's say I got into the school, to show people that hey. I'm capable of this. This very thing that you accuse me of not being capable of. 

Then what? 

I would probably freeze the school. So i could continue drawing and doing my business in peace without this thing prying at the back of my mind every single day. 

Then what? 

Drop out of school? Go back to school and hate your life? Drop out and feel insecure that you don't have a degree? Get into the engineering major and maybe regret quitting econ and finances?

I have a feeling I'll feel insecure no matter what I do. 

How the fuck do I get rid of this?

(Sorry for poor English and grammar, not native and haven't slept tonight due to thinking about these things. I'm extremely sad at the moment. Not sure what i expect from this either, words of affirming? Strangers saying ""hey, don't sweat it."" I don't know. I just want someone out there to know about my struggling. I have no one to really talk to about these things, without them judging me. 

Thanks.)",college,feeling incompetent and worthless,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vlnpl8/feeling_incompetent_and_worthless/,1656328301.0,school is too expensive,7.033333333333333

No realistic backup major or anything of course, unless I'm prepared to go hungry. And that's just college; I'm so fucking unprepared for the real world.

But first, please don't bother with the ""it will get better"" pep talk. That's a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I'm downright resentful of it. I was told college is so much better than high school, then went into easy but unfulfilling and lonely community college. I've now transferred into my university and spent 2 semesters of painful Zoom U here. I've set foot on the campus once. My school's mostly back to normal next semester, but because I've been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don't know if I can adapt.

My peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I'll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I've ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably heap on me.

My sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones.

My study habits are ruined; I can't imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they've all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can't pay attention to anything. I gave up reading any scholarly articles, i've tried and tried, I just can't. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive.

My social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone's too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don't know my school, I don't know kids in my major. I do know I'm not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know how oppressive the college workload. Never mind that I'm socially stunted to begin with.

I hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it's very likely I'm exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don't tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can't promise me many things with substance behind them, so if you can only post empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I'd rather you just not post anything at all.

Please don't bother to suggest therapy either. I've always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school's counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make life more miserable. I can't take those odds. They're always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways.

I looked up those- I was gently told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn't afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (over ~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it's not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just postpone their problems.

I discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It's not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it's worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.

[deleted],1318056967,/r/AskReddit/comments/l4xvv/reddit_i_would_really_appreciate_some_advice/,"So, I really love my brother, but at the same time I really hate him. I hate everything about him. He's selfish, he's immature and he's very very self centered. My family has been a pretty average European middle class family. We live in a good neighborhood, and my brother and I have been going to a very middle classy high school, with a lot of variety of people, majority good. My parents have been such good parents it's extraordinary.

As my parents both grew up in a strict developing (then) country they've been relatively strict on both me and my brother, but still we have been granted enough freedom to be able to go out every weekend and afford certain small luxuries. We've both been educated well but a few years ago my brother had entered his rebellious age. It stared off with coming home later than curfew, but when he was about 15 he started drinking and sneaking out almost every night. I found out he became a smoker when he was around the age of 11 or 12. 

Anyway, at about fifteen and sixteen, the normal rebellious ages for many teens, he also started getting into very intense arguments with my parents. My parents trying to lead him towards a good path but he kept resisting. He started to fail in school, which was strange because he was very very intelligent. At about sixteen, he ran away from home about twice or three times after big arguments with parents. I remember I was home one time when he returned to pick up some of his clothing and my mother tried to get him to stop and talk to her about what was going on, why he was feeling so angry. She wouldn't let him go outside but my brother took his soccer boots and began hitting her on the head so my mother let go. 

After a few days he came back home and we talked it out and everything was fine, but he still began on doing these things. He would drink until he couldn't hold in any more, he smoked like a chimney and started doing drugs pretty regularly. Not very hard drugs but weed and E were the main. One day I came home from school and my mother asks me if I know where the missing money is. Apparently we had a stash of foreign money hidden and a good 400 euros went missing. Me and my brother had no idea what the hell happened to it. A few months later my mother finds that there was more money missing on a card which has rent money put on it every month from one of our apartments but we never use it as it was for holidays. She realizes that the only other person apart from her and my dad who knew the pin code was my brother. They sit him down and he confesses to taking the money after my parents told him they would not be angry. It turns out my brother had stolen more than $2000 dollars from them. My 16 year old brother stole money from my parents to be able to buy food drugs alcohol and cigarettes. He promises to pay them back but three years later he still hasn't returned a single cent to them. Ever since he has become more and more bitter towards my parents. 
            
He failed and didn't graduate high school and so he has to do a foundation course to get into university. Every day he comes home stoned and never ever does anything to contribute to our family. When my parents leave for a short well deserved vacation my brother throws parties, snorts powder, smokes weed and has many friends over. I feel sick and disgusted and unsafe in my own home and I hate it. The truth was, I have been influenced by my brother to be more rebellious than I would have been if I was a single child, but never in a million years have I not returned home for few days straight because I was on drinking and drug binges or  ever stolen anything. The worst I have ever done was probably coming home at four in the morning drunk instead of 12. He is now almost twenty, and I am almost 18. My brother had a job working at a supermarket but he got fired because he was caught pocketing money. He also got arrested. He is been getting worse. He hates my parents and I have to live caught in between them because I try to cover up for my brother while at the same time I try to understand him and make him realize that what he is doing is wrong. I see how incredibly hurt my parents are whenever he does these things. He is extremely lazy, and not once has he cared or put us in front of him. It was always me me me. He is still living at home because he could never sustain him self if he were to move out. My parents have tried but they them self think that if he were to leave he would soon ind him self on the streets. My brother is rarely home, but when he is we end up fighting because he never does anything around the house. He is basically a nuisance. He comes home, begs my parents for money, eats and leaves again. He started receiving money from the government to help him with his studies at school. He gets 160 dollars a month to spend on what ever he needs that is school related but he still has the decency to scream ""cheap bitch"" in my mum's face when she only gives him a few dollars to catch the bus to university. I have tried so many things and we've all tried talking to him, but he simply doesn't care. I never knew it was possible to hate and love someone so much.

TD;LR My brother is selfish and arrogant,he hurts my parents, steals from them, gets drunk or high almost everyday and he has no future. He can't maintain him self but he won't listen to us when we try to help him.

ididabarrelroll,1331741006,/r/AskReddit/comments/qwb3y/did_a_triple_barrel_roll_in_my_car_and_now_i_cant/,"I have a question to ask the hive mind in hopes that I can attempt to straighten a few things out.  I can be the stoic type and I hate asking for help when it comes to mental issues. 

Near the end of last July, I totaled my car in a spectacular fashion.  I crested a hill and found myself with someone crossing over into my lane on a little two lane country road.  I swerved to miss the truck and my rear end caught the soft dirty shoulder.  I over corrected leading to losing control of the car, planting it in the opposite ditch with enough energy left to force it to slide up to the end of the ditch and finally did a triple barrel roll up and out.  Finally came to rest on all four wheels though one was bent to be nearly parallel to the ground.

To make things worse, my 6 year old son was in the seat next to me.  He came out of the accident with only scrapes and bruises. I came out with cracked ribs, messed up shoulder and two compressed vertebrates.  But dammit all, we walked from that wreck.  Granted it was only about 20 feet until I was on the ground in pain.  We were told at the ER that if we didn’t have the full curtain airbags in the vehicle we would have been dead.  If I ever meet the engineers of that car, I will hug them and tell them thank you for my son’s life.

I have been to the doctors, physically my body is as good as it going to get.  I do have back pains now but honestly I can control them with a range of meds from simple OTC stuff to scripts just depending on the weather and what I did that day.

Now the heart of my questions:  I cannot get this out of my head.  Every accident I have ever been in I have learned from them and yes they do pop up in my mind but usually I can chuckle them off and that is that.  This one I cannot shake.  My everyday doctor told me that it was PTSD.  I feel like shit thinking it is PTSD.  So many people in this world have seen much worse things and considering myself to have the same issues seems to discredit what others have to deal with.  But here I sit.  I have been driving a much larger vehicle since the accident.  At first it was for the reason that it was much easier for me to get in and out of due to the back damage.  Now, I have fears of being in smaller cars.  I am going to have to move to a smaller car soon due to my larger vehicle is aging and I just cannot afford to pay to feed it with rising gas prices.

The other day I stumbled onto videos of people with dash cams and wacky winter driving.  One was a head on collision and all you really saw was the windshield instantly spidering with the impact.  I sobbed for 20 mins after that.  I haven’t been able to go to the spot of the accident.  I have to drive by the road we turned down that ultimately leads to the accident site daily and I damn near have a panic attack weekly on one of the trips.

Sometimes I am just sitting in a car and my eyes well up with tears.  I have found myself in the middle of watching Top Gear or playing Forza having a sense of dread just flow over me.  These are both something that I love and my son loves.  It is not something that is going to be removed from my life.  I have found myself snapping at my son when he starts to talk about car crashes.  He could just be talking about his Hot Wheels.  I cannot take this anymore.

The few times I have attempted to seek help in the past, I have beta-maled myself.  I have tried to explain my feelings to friends, family, and doctors.  Friends often will hear me out and it is nice to bounce things off of them but in the end it doesn’t solve the issues in my mind.  I cannot talk about this to my wife as she is too stressed with her life; she puts in 80+ hours a week on work and school.  It isn’t fair to her.  I cannot talk to my parents about this as my father is just as stoic and doesn’t understand mental issues.  He has always been the type to just deal and move on.  My mom on the other hand….she is a poster child of mental issues.  My mom’s side of the family is rife with addiction issues.  My sister is the one that understands the most with me but she is battling similar demons. 

Doctors to me are very hit and miss.  It seems like every time I attempt to seek help for any medical reason and that I try to do the right thing for my health I get a crappy doc that doesn’t want to listen or is just too damn busy to care.  I am in this loop that I don’t know how to break.  So I will ask the hive mind, how do you deal with trauma like this?  What has work for you in the past; what hasn’t work?  How did you find the courage to admit to a doctor that you couldn’t handle it anymore?  How did you admit to this “failure”?  Yes, it isn’t a failure…but it certainly feels like a failure in my mind not being able to handle this.  How did you handle the idea of taking drugs when you have a family history of addictions?  Thankfully I don’t have any debilitating addictions but I have been very active in my life being one step ahead of them knowing my family history.  But I have to say, it is nice that on the nights I use the stronger drugs I have been prescribed to just be able to be calm and have a serene few hours from my overactive mind.  I just want to be whole again.

ComradeSeaman,1552276962,/r/college/comments/azopb5/should_i_transfer_to_another_college_closer_to/,"TLDR: I go to a commuter school far from home and I feel lonely. Should I give up the good program I'm in to go back home for school?

Sorry for the wall of text.

I am a Freshman in an accelerated Pharmacy Program on the East Coast. I've been wrestling with this idea for a lot of time recently and would like some advice for what I should do.

For starters, I am originally from California. Most of my extended family lives around the same area as me, so I tend to associate the two. When I was applying for colleges, I felt that I wanted something beyond California. I didn't want to feel like I never tried to explore beyond my home. Also, I considered my talents and influences, and figured that I wanted to become a Pharmacist.

So, once the acceptances and rejections came in, I decided that I would go to this university in New York with an accelerated Pharmacy program. Not only did it provide a direct path to a career, but it was also a big change from my normal settings. Further, I received more scholarships for that school than any others I applied to, making it essentially the same price I would pay to attend a UC. So, with a set career, big change that I wanted, and (relatively) a lot of money, what more could I ask for?

Well, now that I am in my second semester of Freshman, as well as the power of hindsight, I recognize some of the issues with my situation.

For one, the school I go to is a commuter school. I failed to take this into account when I applied, but now I realize the issues this causes. Namely, it is much more difficult to create a social circle. I don't think that it's because it's a commuter school, but because it is a commuter school in another state. Beyond school hours, campus is practically dead, with little to no events besides the introductory freshman events and the like. It feels like everyone who goes here went to the same high schools or were even in the same friend groups before they went to college, and trying to join in on these groups feels awkward at best, and downright rude at worst. Further, any sense of party atmosphere is dominated by the frats which, frankly, I'm not into. There is the sense of exclusivity where you need to know the right people to go to these events. Also, because of the commuter environment, a lot of people who do live on campus tend to go home on the weekends, increasing the lonely atmosphere that campus has.

I tried to remedy this by joining clubs, but I failed to get to know anyone beyond other freshmen who joined the club at the same time. I've made a couple of friends along the way, mostly through virtue of being in the same program or club, but nothing feels substantially close for me.

But, most of all, I feel homesick. I love New York and being able to explore it on a vastly superior public transportation system is a nice bonus. But, the more I try to explore, the more alone I feel. It feels awkward trying to get to explore a place with someone who has lived there their whole life and is not even particularly close to you. I start to think more about home and all the friends and family I left to ""Do my own thing.""

From here, I feel that I have two choices:

1. Stick it out and hope the situation gets better
2. Transfer out to another college

I have reason to believe in Option 1 because it is the same thing that happened to me in High School. I didn't truly have a reliable friend group until late into my Junior Year. I still talk with them and make the effort to hang out whenever I come back home. But, I still remember the first two and a half years of loneliness and fake-feeling friendships I had to deal with until I made it to that point. Also, who's to say it'll work out like that again?

Option 2 is a much riskier path, but the rewards I might reap are also much higher. If I do transfer out, I feel that my best option might be one of the UCs. From what I observed during my college visits, the UCs tended to have more active campuses overall. Further, with a greater number of people coming from within the state, I have much more in common with the other students.

The greatest loss out of this option is transferring out of the accelerated Pharmacy Program. One of the benefits of being within the program is that I do not have to take the PCAT. If I were to transfer out, I would first have to apply to another major, graduate, and then take the PCAT and apply into another Pharmacy School. All this taking \~8 years, whereas the current program is 6.

Another option is to attend UoP in Stockton, which also has multiple Pre-Pharmacy Programs. However, I am unsure of the exact details of how my credits would transfer (UoP has 2+3, 3+3, and 4+3 programs, whereas my current college is 0-6) or if I would even be allowed to apply to those programs. Further, UoP is also quite expensive, and I chose not to attend as I originally felt that I did not receive enough scholarships to justify attendance.

Perhaps I could do a little of both - stick it out for my sophomore year and, if it still doesn't work out, transfer.

However, I can't help but hear this nagging notion that I'm simply conflating California and Comfort. As a transfer, I feel that I would have just as hard a time with creating my social circle as I do now, simply because most friendships would have already been established. I feel this sense of awkwardness would be even greater if I tried to apply as a Junior for the same reasons. Further, perhaps it is not the environment I am in that is making it difficult, but my own shyness and personality.",college,Should I transfer to another college closer to home?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/azopb5/should_i_transfer_to_another_college_closer_to/,1552298562.0,can't pay for school,6.966666666666667
antant26,1585293263,/r/college/comments/fpsle8/families_pressuring_kids_into_certain_majors_and/,"I'm just a sophomore going to a state school who is observing some trends, feel free to share your perspectives and ideas. 

I see a lot of kids being forced by their parents into fields they're not passionate and it concerns me. I absolutely love my major, the career prospects, and feel very lucky that I am driven with a passion for doing what I love. I don't know if it's just my school with a high acceptance rate, but I've been seeing a trend. 

It breaks my heart how many people in my classes are being forced into nursing by their parents. They  aren't given a license and opportunity to explore what they enjoy. They're expected to just attend classes and never question their parent's judgement. Or, they're forcing to double major and deal with a ridiculous amount of stress. My friend is trying to double major in music (demanding major with ten classes) and balance his parents' desire for him to go into speech pathology, and it's a lot for him to handle. 

I had to counsel a friend in my psychology class about his parents wanting him to go into nursing. His real passion was computer science or business, and I had to tell him that at the end of the day, his parents are just people with a certain opinion about what career he should go into. If he did become a nurse to please them but never followed his true passion, that wouldn't have been good for anyone. I dunno about you guys but I can't serve people well when I'm not happy. I can't be there, be present, if I don't love what I'm doing.

I realize not everyone has the ability to pursue a career they're passionate about. Sometimes familial financial stressors are real and a healthcare profession can help a lot. For a lot of people, college is a number's game to get a better life, and I wholly respect that. I'm just saying that parents don't have to be the end-all be all in deciding where a child's life will go. There's other fields and disciplines, and allowing exploration is healthy, even beneficial. Everything will go smoother if the student is studying something they actually enjoy. 

Forcing a child to pursue a career in one discipline while ignoring the profitability of others is my main concern. Especially when forcing someone into a healthcare field, this can have real consequences. Those who pursued a college education to please their parents who find themselves stuck in a career serving others that they do not enjoy does not serve anyone well. 

I also see an alarming number of students go straight into college without doing any market research. Lots of kids have ideas of going to grad school, but there are other ways to get into fields like physical therapy that are a lot more immediate and therefore provide more experience faster. Having all the information you can about a field you're going into is important, having a realistic view before commuting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars into something that might not be a true passion is important.  

I feel like associate's degrees are underrated. I know loads of kinesiology majors wanting to go into physical therapy, and while getting a bachelor's degree can be great, getting an associate's could make more sense. I've seen physical therapy assistant salaries are pretty great, you get your hands into the field sooner, better return on investment, and if PT does end up not being the right choice, they can always get a bachelor's degree. I've seen loads of openings for this kind of position, there is market demand, and it doesn't make sense to me to major in something you've never really tried out in the real world. 

I read somewhere that the average amount of times people change their careers throughout their lifespan is five to seven times. That's a lot of career changes. Doing market research is also important to make sure that what you're majoring in will pay off. Loads of popular majors like Biology, English, Social sciences, and others have a pretty high percentage of people that regret their major decision. While there are some advantages to these fields and there's nothing wrong with absolutely loving them, having a realistic idea of what life will be like after graduation is important.

Throughout several ""draw my life"" videos I've watched, the darkest time people mention is usually when they graduate college and face the real world. In my local area there is actually a support group for such people on how much reality can bite. It's hard when you had a great time studying anthropology, but can only get a job as a dental receptionist. My friend actually had to move to another state for better cost of living.

Going to grad school doesn't have to be right after college. My mom got her master's degree in her fifties, and her world experience gave her advantages as an applicant. I feel like lots of people say they want to pursue a PhD, and that's great. However, there are some issues with oversaturated fields and limited tenured job opportunities. Things are different in today's world than they were for our professors. 

I see lots of psychology majors who intend to go to graduate school, and that's great. We always need more healthcare professionals. However, a psychology degree on its own has limited applications (my mom said the only job you could get is being a caseworker). Grad school is hard to get into, and I feel like we should be more honest about that. Having career field experience can be extremely valuable, and it should not be undermined. Doing market research is important, and it's not worth going thousands of dollars into debt to pursue a major you don't love or one that doesn't give you the standard of living you desire.

Tl;dr Parents forcing children into certain fields completely ignoring the profitability of other options (associate's degrees) and throwing children into getting into debt without doing proper market research on market demand, profitability, job satisfaction, degree flexibility, or examining how things things in the past do not apply or are different today.",college,Families pressuring kids into certain majors and not doing market research,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fpsle8/families_pressuring_kids_into_certain_majors_and/,1585314863.0,can't pay for school,6.96
Dandelion-Taxik,1607724902,/r/college/comments/kbcmbv/thinking_of_switching_from_architecture_to_web/,"I am a 2nd-year architecture student at a CA community college, going into my 3rd year of undergrad. A month or so recently I developed serious doubts about my major, thinking of my future and what I want it to be like: job, daily life, place of living, finances, and social life. As of now, I am pretty much on track for a grad transfer for B.A. in Arch. at UCB: I have a solid network, a good transfer plan/plan of action, some insight into the industry, via interviews from people who work in it (intern, junior, senior,) and completion of most of my base arch. classes (1 year to go.) However, the more I keep thinking of architecture, the more I am anxious and pessimistic about it, especially grad school. 

The prime and most important reason is that I no longer have the same excitement about it anymore now that I've gone through the more technical architecture classes, residential design for example. Other reasons include:

1) Worrying about my ability to climb the corporate ladder after uni. education or rather the time it takes to do so per effort.

2) Not at all ok with the dismal financial prospects of the profession.

3) A commonly reported lack of the creative aspect on the job in day-to-day life compared to other elements like legal and business inquiries. I want my job to be a good deal of collaboration, design, and business work, a nice mesh/combo of elements, none of which dominate the other two unless I wish it to. (Last bit accounts for any future endeavors I might pursue in the future: not everything can be planned.)

4) Having to switch careers at 25-26 when in actuality I want this question to be figured out by my current age so by 25-30 I settle myself into a niche within the industry. I am very grateful for my current circumstances, a family that supports my prolonged time in college and does not ask me to pay for rent. I want to take advantage of this time and opportunities, not ask for them (opportunities) again by 25-26.

5) The common reported lack of life balance within the profession, specifically after years of experinece. I definitely do not expect to have any life balance in my 20s, because my 20s is just ""work."" But, I do want to be able to make my job a big part of my life, but not ALL of my life: I do want to account for possible children at age 30-35, and specifically being able to afford myself and them by that time. 

6) The common high debts reported on this major. I want to minimize costs and maximize my time so I can create other financial or business assets that I can leverage for any design endeavors I might want to pursue.

7) The specificity of this field. Sure, architecture is pretty general for other construction spheres and does touch upon other areas like industrial design, but I'm not sure its as general as I would like it to be. 

Now, I know ux/ui and generally, product design, is a hot field right now, getting saturated with a lot of people who are just starting out, a good deal of them career-switchers. And I admit, having the life that a lot of people in these professions report sounds pretty good to me. However, I am not blind: every profession is difficult, it is its own thing, and deserves one to put effort into it. Those who are the best and employ themselves are the most satisfied and financially secure individuals because they do not give up their own power to someone else. And it is important to actually like the profession for it to hold up long-term because the pursuit of interest is what ultimately drives personal satisfaction and exterior success. 

I want to actually be good at what I do, not just jump in on a hot profession for the lifestyle or money it provides. And so pursuing at least an industry of interest and an industry that fits my other life goals while in college is important to me. I know a B.A. doesn't gurantee a job, much less a related one or a good one, but I think switching my focus officially to product design and working on it by myself on the side is the best combination for my current age and situation. My family basically wants me to get a B.A. in anything, as long as it is something and affordable. Time for them does not matter, surprisingly. I think the area of interest for me now is ui design, the superficial side of product development. I like working with graphics, motion, 3D, learning new technologies, and I am definitely very excited about thinking how a user would be interacting with what I make and why: that is the core reason I pursue architecture now, just a different medium. I think ux and product design is also of major interest to me, but ui is really the field I want to zone in on.I am definitely not up for going full on computer science as a major: I want to approach ui and related fields more from design and maybe a minor in business to navigate the market.

So, here are some of my plans of action:

1) Continue architecture and graduate with a BA in it, then do a boot camp to see if product design/ux/ui is for me.

2) Abandon architecture all together and pursue product  design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit.

3) Continue architecture and take a class on product design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit, and do free courses on web design-related content over winter break, so I know what I am getting into. Not full-time, but enough to get some understanding of it. (This is the current plan for spring 2020 since I can't take many classes on product design: they are either filled up or I was stupid enough to not be applicable for them since I am not a student for those colleges. Plans 1 and 2 would apply to next summer and fall 2020.)

2) Abandon architecture all together and pursue product  design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit.

3) Continue architecture and take a class on product design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit, and do free courses on web design-related content over winter break, so I know what I am getting into. Not full-time, but enough to get some understanding of it. (This is the current plan for spring 2020 since I can't take many classes on product design: they are either filled up or I was stupid enough to not be applicable for them since I am not a student for those colleges. Plans 1 and 2 would apply to next summer and fall 2020.)

AphonicGod,1568964785,/r/college/comments/d6rftu/help_for_a_bullshit_math_class_and_a_teacher_who/,"I'm a freshman with a complicated personal situation thats adding alot of stress to my life on top of this, if thats important. 

the only general math class i have to take is a Math115 (intermediate Algebra) course. when registering for classes, this class section was at the best time for me, but teacher was TBA. i looked up all my other professors on rate my professor as i registered and they were all cool so i decided to take my chances. (this part right here was hands down the WORST decision my poor naïve self made.) 

...fast forward to first day of school. i get handed my syllabus, Professor starts explaining how it works and by the end of the class i wanted to puke. my heart dropped and i knew this class would drag me by my hair screaming and crying to the end of the semester. 

the class works like this: 

1) all work is done in ALEKS. for anyone who has been graced with not knowing what this is, its a *VERY* universally hated online math program. ""topics"" are problem subjects inside of a ""pie"" and every ""slice"" of the pie is a subject (real mumbers/linear equations/polynomials/etc.). each slice has varying amounts of topics.

2) every topic has to be completed for you to pass. all 250+ topics. it doesnt matter if you take the paper final and pass. if you dont pass ALEKS you fail. 

3) homework is open in a window of friday-thursady 11:59. you either get 10pts or 0pts. you cant get partial credit. it doesnt matter if you're assigned 32 topics for the week and you do 31. if you dont do 32 you get 0pts. 

4) ALEKS will decide when you need a calculator. also no calculators on the paper quizes ever. 

5) its a M/W/F class. M/W she lectures for 20 mins on a few of the topics then we do hmwk for the rest of class. F we get a 10 point quiz and then group work. in group work we get a packet of unfamiliar problems and we get to teach eachother what to do. (i take issue with this because i have bad anxiety about doing math around people) 

6) if you cant complete your homework you still cant complete those topics. why? well when the next hmwk cycle begins ALEKS locks every unit before it. you have to work to finish early to beable to get to those previous units. 

7) Knowledge checks!!!!! basically, ALEKS sometimes forces you to take a test (that isnt graded for the class by my professor) to make sure you actually learned the topics you completed. if you get a question wrong you have to redo that topic. see 6 for why thats horrible. 

8) if you have less than 4 abscenses you dont have to take the paper final, you can only take the ALEKS comprehensive. when asked about how hard it is Prof deadass says ""oh no one has had to try more than about 5 times."" like...the fuck? 

so. this being said we now arrive to right now. I've talked to my professor 3 seperate times about why this class stresses me out so much, and i ask for just a little bone, just something. maybe an extra day for homework, maybe being allowed to use calculators (im a bit bad at paper add/sub bc i go fast and make dumbass mistakes. i know how to do the algebraic concept but some topics take me hours bc i do small fuck ups), unlocking previous topics so i can be sure im still up to speed, less topics every week (week 1 was 25 tpcs, 2 was 32tpcs, this week was only 13 but they were very tedious and very difficult,), partial credit on hmwk, just...SOMETHING. 

i explained that ive already spent lots of time crying and stressing over this class and its so early in the semester. so she pulls up my student report and saw that last wednesday (week 2) i spent 4.5 hours working, and that i worked on my homwork a bit every single day. she asked me how many credits im taking (15), and when i  answered she simply said that it was my fault im stressed because im probably taking too many classes. i was like??? no???? i need to take 15 a semester to graduate in 2 years (im going for an associate.) i know the content of the class but the amount of work with all these resrictions is what makes this more difficult than even my 4 credit class. 

she didnt care though and she waved me away. this conversation happened about 2 more times after this. im upset and frustrated because im doing my best to make sure i succeede and following the advice of ""talk to professors early! they'll work with you if you're dilligent!""  but she just. doesnt care. it doesn't help that when she DOES actually teach its super grating to listen to because she talks like she's teaching 5th graders. i still do my part and take notes for things i dont know but im at a loss. putting so much focus on this class is fucking with my time management for my other classes' homework because i have to spent such a disproportionate amount of time here. 

ALEKS is also horribly finniky. i typed an answer as 13x-5x^2+13 and got marked wrong because it wanted -5x^2+13x+13. without stating anywhere that answers were ONLY accepted in standard notation. mind you tho, it accepts things like "" 45/9 "" and "" 2/8 "". 

Im currently doing my best but this class is making me despise math all over again, even though i know algebra can be really cool and im actually decent at it. how do i deal with this? should i keep talking to her? I've been thinking of just going to the department head, because im not the only person in this class struggling so much. I'm not withdrawing because i really dont have the money to essentially have wasted on the class and the stupid activation code for ALEKS. (my tuition is like 95% covered by federal aid, 5% im struggling to pay for out-of-pocket.)",college,Help for a bullshit math class and a teacher who doesn't care (this is long im sorry.),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d6rftu/help_for_a_bullshit_math_class_and_a_teacher_who/,1568986385.0,struggling with tuition,6.946666666666666
Gourmay,1294752679,/r/AskReddit/comments/f076t/anyone_else_have_very_difficult_parents_more/,"My mother has always been quite strict, difficult, very distant; I have a collection of pictures from my childhood birthdays with bloodshot eyes on every one of them from her screaming at me about this or that. When I got shitty grades in school, she took all my toys, put them in bin bags and locked them in the garage. 

My sister and I know very little about her life before she came to France but from what I found out very recently, she was pretty privileged. My grandfather (an army guy who wasn't a lot of fun) paid for all her studies, she spent a year in an expensive school in the UK and he bought her the place I grew up in.

I moved to another country when I turned 18 and 6 years later, because my career wasn't going the way I wanted it to, I decided to go home for a year so I could save some money, have more time to work on my projects etc. before I move to America. I assumed she would mellow out with age but she hasn't. 

She had breast cancer (caught early so masectomy but no chemo) and she was just horrendous to be around at that time. Not sad, just really angry and unpleasant to be around; I know for a fact that it was so bad, my stepdad thought about divorcing her. She's been just as bad since.
Despite already having a guest room (and that she receives guests that stay over about once every two years) she decided to redo my room and that I would have 'no choice in decoration' while I was still here which was pretty hurtful, that it wasn't going to be 'a shrine to me'. Most of my friends, some in their thirties, still have a room with some of their things at their parent's place, is that insane? I mean I'm barely 25, not married or anything so it feels normal for my stuff to be there.

She visited my sister who lives abroad and just had kids and apparently spent the whole time criticizing her home etc. My sister was anorexic for years and I'm pretty sure my mother was at least partly responsible for it. The way I now experience it, she makes you feel like you should disappear. 

She is a mega-purger, when I buy food and put it in the cupboards she presses me to get rid of it because it 'takes up space'. You can't leave a sweater in the living room without her freaking out and making you take it up to the room. I went to work abroad for a few months and she went through all my stuff, tossed tons of things, my autograph collection, some important payslips, poured an expensive bottle of sloe gin I'd been gifted down the drain etc. The other day I found my entire record collection in our public garage (30 people have access to it); she's been after my stuff for years, she opens my wardrobe and says I own too many t-shirts etc etc. It's true I do hoard a bit, I keep some news clippings every now and then and I do own a lot of clothes; I plan on selling a bunch of stuff on ebay but I'm not a 'hoarder' in that way.

Whenever my sister and I asked her how she was during or after the cancer, she would reply with a snappy fine and then get angry later for 'never asking how she is'. While I was still abroad, she called me to yell at me because my artist myspace page had written in the end of my bio that I liked 'astronomy, art, and dirty jokes!' She yelled at me to remove it etc etc. (I'm in my mid-twenties and I work in arts and video games, there's not a chance I'd ever work in a bank or somewhere they would care). 

A few years ago I had a big shoulder operation and I was quite freaked out beforehand, when I got her on the phone all she could say was 'grow up stop being such a baby'. Honestly I could write a novel with the amount of stuff that have been said and done over the years. I'm sure I haven't been the perfect kid either, but I don't do drugs, I don't even really drink, I graduated university with top marks, I supported myself since I was 19 or 20, I don't eat all their food, I don't use the phone, I don't watch tv, I don't play music loud at any time of day, I don't ever bring people over, I'm polite. I mean I try to not minimize my flaws but really there are worse kids.

Today she told me she had spoken to doctors about my case and that I was sick in the head, that I needed to see someone which was just such a horrible thing to say. There is no way to win with her, no way to make her understand she sometimes might be wrong. I actually cannot cope anymore and want to hear about what you've done in similar situations, how you've kept yourself up etc. These days I'm so upset, I don't have the strength to work on my projects, I just browse reddit and the internet to get my mind off things. Fuck and I'm a really strong person, I've been through super difficult and psychologically draining jitsu training and gradings for years, people saying horrible stuff, being poor in an unknown city, finding out my dad had kids before me, living with horrible flatmates etc etc. It gets to the point where I almost wish she was hitting me physically instead of being how she is. Honestly I try to love her and do everything to please her but it's starting to be really really not feasible. I don't think she's a bad person but as one of my close friends puts it, she is the nicest person to everyone except her daughters..

Divorced 10 years ago and was screwed over quite well by the courts. Had to pay loads of child support for (2) kids I barely got to see 4 days a month to a woman who didn't want the kids in the first place. FFWD a couple years, several visits from Children Services and quite a few arguments, my ex-wife files ""unruly child"" papers against my then 9 year old daughter and tell me to come get her, she's done. A few signed papers later, I have full custody of her and she is living with me.

I have worked my ass off making sure that she had everything that I could afford, put her to school in the best school district around...No I didn't spoil her with all the Apple products out there or overindulge in her demands for the most expensive attire, but she was allowed vacations, and visits to friends houses as often as she wanted, as long as the household rules were maintained. 

Over the years her visits to her mothers have been filled with tears, humiliation and just plain hatred. A few examples of recent: 4 months ago her mother told her that she was too much if a b*tch and she didn't want to deal with her on vacation, so she left our daughter home and took my son and his best friend on the trip. 3 months ago, on my daughters 16th birthday her mother took her out to eat with that side of her family; not a single one of them spoke to her. They all sat in the restaurant in silence, ate and left. Not one uttered a Happy Birthday. I had to pick my devastated kid up at the Restaurant because her mother wouldn't take her home after she acted that selfish (by crying)...

Anyway, I have YEARS of examples like this. They just don't get along and have gone months without talking. 

So, throughout her life my kid has tried, and failed to become a cheerleader. She has endlessly tried to get on a team, only to be cut since she just wasn't what the school wanted. This has been her life long dream, there is something about cheering that she believe is going to make her a success in life and that there is nothing more important.

Recently she found a Cheer squad local that she tried for, and was accepted to. It's a professional, travelling team, ya know, the ones you see overly caked in make-up and short skirts terrorizing Disney and  other theme parks? Yeah. It's $7,000 a year with $3K due upfront. 

While I am not broke, I do not have money just sitting around like that and so, although it hurt me to do it, I had to tell her no. It just wasn't possible to spend that kind of money annually to send her to cheer, not to mention the daily time investment in driving her back and forth until she succeeded in getting her license. Needless to say she was all kinds of unhappy and, this last weekend went to visit her mother.

One hour before she was due to come home I get a text: ""Dad, I'm going to live with mom from here on out. SHE will let me cheer while you won't. YOU have to sign the papers when we get there tonight.""

WTF??!!? Hours of conversations later it is discovered that there are cheerleading sign-ups in the town my ex lives in on the upcoming Monday (yesterday.) You have to be registered at the school there to get on the team. On Monday, my ex goes to the school in her town and tells them that I am in full agreement and that she wants to register daughter for the school. She then picks her up and takes her to the Cheer meeting, where the administration says ""as long as you get her registered for the school we will take her.""

So...here it is Tuesday. My brain is numb trying to think this all through. Do I allow her to move in with her mother for her last 2 years of school so she can cheer? I know she can't stand the woman and the household aspect will be a mess, but she has friends there, she will cheer and will have a car to leave if needed.

OR, do I fight the custody, since we know it will take 2 years to get though court and the odds of her mother getting custody are slim to none, and have my child resent me for not allowing her to reach this all important to her goal?

TL:DR I can't afford $7000 cheerleading so daughter wants to make knee-jerk reaction to move in with her uncaring mother Just so she can cheer in that school.

Missing a small bit of info, I didn't fully include. 1. she didn't make try-out on her current school, you have to be very talented to get in 2. she found a ""pay-to-cheer"" competitive program, out of school, that is $7000/mo 3. Her mothers school district will put a cheerleading costume on anyone, therefore she will be part of the team, but may not ever get to participate. It's a little over $500 to cheer there.

UPDATE: I am thinking of a possible trial attempt at this. Instead of giving over full custodial rights I am thinking instead of allowing her to use her mothers (address) to gain access to the school. Allow her to stay there through the summer and attempt the cheer camps to see if she and her mother can handle living together while doing so. My hopes here are that she is able to either a. be successful and get into the cheer team come school start or b. have the chance to realize that this was not the right decision and not have to fight to get her back.

stupidpinay1234,1496262306,/r/college/comments/6ehpfa/willing_get_50000_in_debt_destroy_my_familys/,"I am well aware that this is going to make me sound like an absolutely awful child, but please hear out my story.

My whole life I have dreamed of working in film. It is one of the few dreams that has been consistent throughout the years, and I can confidently say that I am unable to see myself thriving academically and enjoying any other major. I have my heart set on film and there is nothing else I want to pursue. My senior year of high school, I opted to commit to a liberal arts school that did not offer my major, in order to save money and later transfer to my dream school. I was thrilled to be accepted into Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California for fall of 2016. It has everything that I looked for in a college:
-Thriving film school, with an abundance of opportunities due to their 
 connections
-Prime film student location (LA)
-Large university
-Ethically diverse (I'm half Asian so this was important to me)
-Thriving varsity sports teams
-a minor in dance
-a dance team/club that I could participate in
-study abroad in the majorly unoffered country I was looking for

After attending a small liberal arts school out in Pennsylvania, that did not offer any of these qualifications, I can say that I was quite miserable that year. Even though the school worked out financially (no loans, my parents could pay out of pocket for it), I can't see myself ever going back. In addition to not offering my major or minor, which would cause me to have to change my entire career path, I did not enjoy the small campus, small student body, lack of college sports and clubs, and pretty much everything else that a small school in the middle of nowhere offers. I'm looking for the stereotypical college experience (large campus, loads of people of all ages, sports, loads of clubs, etc). The professors I encountered were great at my previous institution, but I can't see myself getting good opportunity from a virtually unknown school that can't take me in the career path I am seeking.

Because of these reasons, being accepted into LMU, that offered everything I dreamed of, thrilled me. However, it was financially horrible. The financial aid they offered was so low, I would of had to take out private loans in addition to the loans offered, and if I was able to take out private loans (which I can't because my parents cannot cosign or take on any debt due to their financial situation), I would have graduated with a minimum debt of $50,000, and that would be if I was lucky. Since I could not afford it for fall of 2016, I willing took the year and worked. I reapplied for fall of 2017, was accepted, and now I have the exact same financial issue that made my parents say no the first time.

Since I am already a year behind, and really do not want to waste another year, my parents said they were willing to let me go to LMU, but due to the financial reasons I mentioned, they said that they cannot guarantee that I could finish my degree there. They are willing to let me go for my sophomore year, but when junior year comes around, they can't promise that they will have money left to afford it - which would also mean we are out of money for me to transfer to what would be my third college to get a degree.

I've been looking around at colleges that still accept applications at this time, and I found a few that I might be able to see myself being content at, even though they don't offer everything I looked for like LMU did.

Baylor University: Large university, thriving division 1 sports (esp football), lots of clubs, well known university, offers my major and minor, and has a dance team that I can perform and compete with. The only downside is that it is in the middle of nowhere in Texas, which I think might make me a bit depressed, and I also don't think it would provide the best connections for a film job since it's in Texas)

The New School: spectacular location for film students (New York City), has my major and minor, closer to home so travel is cheaper, but it lacks the sports scene, isn't a well known school, not a lot of clubs, doesn't really offer your typical college experience, and what really sucks for me is that they don't have any sort of dance team/club that I could participate in throughout my years, which I really want to do (esp competitively). However, they offer a jazz dance class as an extracurricular, and could potentially provide good opportunity to a film student so the location is prime. Also, I've done some modeling work, and unlike the other schools I'm mentioning, I could probably continue to do it at this school because its in NYC.

American University: decent location (Washington D.C), large university, thriving athletics, has my major and minor, but there is no dance team that I could participate in, which I'm really looking for, and I probably wouldn't get in if I applied.

I've considered also trying for Syracuse, but I'm still thinking about it. I should note that I have not applied to these 3 schools I just mentioned, I've been considering if I should spent the money to do so since I think I might have to say no to LMU, but I really don't know what to do and what path to take. Also, I don't even know if these school will financially work out for me if I was accepted (I assumed they be better than LMU since LMU is ranked as being one of the stingiest school with financial aid). I want with all my heart to go to LMU, but the finances are clearly not in my favor, and I do not want to take another year off and get even more behind in my career and studies.

I'm so lost, confused, and tired at this point. I'd appreciate any advice.

Megan is pretty awesome, she is funny, sexy, caring, compassionate, and is overall a great girlfriend. I had food poisoning about two weekends ago and she took care of me the whole time while I was shaking, vomiting, feverish and getting close to going to the hospital. 

Had she not been there for me I would have ended up going to the hospital. I was on my couch under a blanket because I had the chills so bad and she sat on the floor next to the couch the whole time and held my hand until I began falling asleep and then made me get up and get in bed where she kept an eye on me all night.

The other day I went to eat with some friends where she works and when she brought the bill there was a very sweet and awesome note written on the back of it.

All in all she's great, I've never had a girlfriend that cares about me like she does and goes out of her way to take care of me, and make me happy. She does all the little things I've always wanted in a girlfriend like little notes, or even caring enough to bring me something to drink when she runs into the gas station. She also always has her own money and I don't have to spend a lot of money on her nor does she expect me to.

I do appreciate how caring and compassionate she is. The last girl I date was smart, driven, and a PHD candidate. She was also one of the most selfish people I've ever met and had a complete lack of empathy that I attributed to her being young and needing to grow up. She was also a raving cheater and has not been able to stay faithful since the first time she had her heart broken. I had a motorcycle accident one time and texted her to tell her that it happened but not to worry that I was fine. She never showed any concern, and didn't even respond to the text about motorcycle accident. I never forgave her for that and it makes me appreciate Megan.

On the other hand, here is what I don't like. Megan is not the smartest girl in the world. Any text she sends me, or note she leaves me is so blatantly rife with spelling errors that it blows my mind as to how someone could not know how to spell a certain word. She'll often stop me mid conversation and ask me what a word means.

She's also younger than me by a few years, and is on the tail end of finishing her GED due to getting in trouble in school and general life issues. She doesn't seem to have a lot of direction in life, has no idea what she wants to do, and won't even consider taking general education college courses until she can settle on a career. Her current job has no future for her either. 

This really bothers me because I always wanted, and am used to dating women who have their own careers in mind, are independent, and have direction and drive in life. I'm very well off for my age (early twenties) with two vehicles, a house, and a motorcycle. I don't care how much money I have, I refuse to be the guy with the stay at home wife who has no education or career.

I've tried to get her into reading, and learning, but she refuses to do it and absolutely hates reading. I can't make her do something she doesn't want to do or better herself if shes not willing.

I also hate her parents even though they love me. Her mother is a raging alcoholic who is constantly cheating on her husband, and I can't stand to be around her mother period, even when she's not drinking sometimes. It's to the point where I won't go into her house anymore, and constantly turn down lunch or dinner invitations so I don't have to deal with her mom.

On top of that she's not very understanding of my love of video games. She views them as a complete waste of time, and gets very upset when I want to play them to unwind and relax. For example we were at a friends house the other night and she was hanging out with his wife since she hasn't seen her in awhile. Me and my friend decided we wanted to hop on XBox Live and play Black Ops for awhile, and we only played for about 30-45 minutes. This put her in a completely terrible mood for the rest of the night and greatly upset her.

At the end of the day I just feel like its not fair that I work 40-60 hours a week, and am in a relationship with someone who smokes way too much weed, and has no drive or direction in life. She won't even take gen ed college courses until she figures out what she wants to do. She also spends far more time than I do playing video games chasing down bags of weed from various people because its such a huge part of her life. I wish she didn't smoke daily because I feel like it dumbs her down and makes her unmotivated. I'm tree friendly but not on a daily basis.

She's also pretty clingy and if she had her way would spend every waking moment with me. She just doesn't understand that some evenings after a long day of work I want to sit around in my boxers and play video games on my myriad of expensive electronics that I've worked my ass off for.

I like her, but I don't think I could ever love her, but I don't know, maybe with time it could happen. Am I just being a picky asshole who needs to shut the hell up or what?

tl;dr My girlfriend is uneducated and we are at very difference places in our lives.

Davidrlz,1486626173,/r/college/comments/5syozo/i_dont_even_know_if_i_can_pursue_being_a_doctor/,"Let me start off by saying, I love college, I really do, but I've been feeling down in the dumps and I don't know where else to post this, let's start at the beginning. I went to a state university in NYC with a Biology Major and hoped to be a M.D. I had a part time job as a busboy/expeditor and found success early on, I was able to shift into college mindset pretty quickly, the only real problem was when I got hit by a car walking out of campus (broken humerus, dislocation, and tears in my ligaments), Thankfully, my broken arm didn't deter my studies and I received a 3.5 GPA. I was ecstatic, I applied myself and got a GPA I wanted and my general shit confidence was able to go up a bit. My second semester was identical to the first(replace job with physical therapy for aforementioned wound), It was my first ""challenge"", I took Bio I, Calc I, and Chem II as my main courses(I believe I had 2 others, but they were ultimately insignificant), I got a 3.5 GPA again, and even started working in a research lab as a freshman where I worked under an amazing graduate student who taught me many neuroscience techniques, I loved it so much that the Summer between Freshman Year and Sophomore year I went 8 hours a day(typical work schedule) during weekdays to work. By the time I reached Sophomore Year, I had my first taste of Upper level classes, I ended up taking only 3 sciences(It was really the only thing I could take, it was Physics I,Orgo I, and Gen Bio II), and had my research formally added as a class for elective credits. I managed, yet again, a 3.5 GPA(A in Bio, C+ in orgo, and B+ in physics I), my orgo grade disappointed me but I believed I could apply myself even more-so, I had many connections and friends in my old university, and carefully planned out my next 5 semesters into(hopefully) Medical School. Then it all came crashing down. My parents got interested in a house in North Jersey, it was nice, bigger than our old one, but it is obviously a big commitment and came with a lot of problems, and mortgage was higher. Without going into detail, we worked with a family friend so my dad would change jobs, and help him with owning restaurants, and we found out about the move in November of my first sophomore semester (the orgo semester), It was too late to transfer to another college, so I told myself I would take a semester off, it would be easy I thought, I can study orgo, study for the MCAT earlier, and be productive, nothing happened. Being away from all my friends, not doing any work at all drove me insane. This house of mine became a prison(didn't help I couldn't find a job from Jan-Mar), I eventually got a job at Dunkin' Donuts(it was miserable there too, it also negatively affected my back, more on that below), I eventually applied to a university nearby my house and got in with a transfer scholarship, I was very happy, I finally felt like my life was back on track after so long, I was thirsty for knowledge and ready to tackle the obstacles ahead of me, I went ahead and registered for Orgo II, Cell Biology, Japanese I(needed a language a this college, and I always liked the language), and a History class. I started off strong in my classes, and even though i stumbled from being rusty, and unfamiliar with concepts, and I had my overall worst semester(this is fall of last year), I got a B in Cell Biology, a C in Orgo II, an A- in history, and an A in Japanese, It made me sad, for two reasons, 1) It's not good enough for Medical School, and 2) A professor I wanted to work(also my advisor) said that it'd be in my best interests not to start research again until my GPA is a 3.5 or higher(which makes sense), so it hit me hard, especially my self-esteem, which was already pretty low from my depression after moving. I told myself I was ready for next semester, I re-evaluated my study habits over winter, took only 1 Science class, and filled the rest with my gen-ed requirements. My current semester is now Japanese II, Genetics, Mathematical Models, Understanding Japanese Popular Culture, and another history class, it was supposed to be a ""rise of the ashes of sorts"", but I didn't pay attention to my familial situation. My father ended up getting a restaurant of his own in October of last year, I was oblivious to what was happening since I assumed he was fine, he watched how to do the job for about half a year after all, but the restaurant was not taken care of by the old owner, my father has been trying hard to bring it back, but his hopes are too high at the moment. He isn't happy, and he takes it out on others, condescending comments are always thrown my way(from my mother too), he asks me to work on less than 24 hour notice after college(ruining my plans for studying, etc.) and making me fall behind on my coursework, and since I now have chronic back pain(which work makes worse) I can't work out and I've been gaining weight, lowering my self-esteem(and receiving more condescending comments from parents), so basically, I am now working way too much(this week alone is going to be over 40), have crippling physical health issues(I don't even have time to schedule an appointment for my back), and bad mental health(from my shattered confidence, self-loathing, and not being able to succeed in college), and from all these effecting my schoolwork( the only thing I was ever good at), I now have nothing, I just want to vent, I just want advice, I want to know how to cope with having your dreams shattered in front of your eyes over circumstances you can't control, ultimately, I just want to be myself again.",college,I don't even know if I can pursue being a Doctor anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5syozo/i_dont_even_know_if_i_can_pursue_being_a_doctor/,1486647773.0,can't pay for school,6.86

(I know people in the area and have support, whereas I only have one person at my current school) I'm working on the application, but I really don't know about the process besides that, and who i need to contact to send paperwork and transcripts over. Can someone who has transferred before offer advice in this trying time?

""I landed in London well enough from Texas, then after a six hour layover I took the short one hour flight to Cork.

When I landed and went to customs they asked what the purpose was, etc. when they asked to see my return ticket I told them I didn't have one, that I was going to just stay for a few weeks at a hostel then go to England by a ferry and stay with my friend for a bit, then go back to cork and meet up with my friend from the states and travel around till she goes to school in late August.

They kept asking more questions like have I ever met these Irish and English friends, how much money did I have on me, in the bank, and kept saying how expensive Ireland is and I didn't have enough, and I kept telling them I'm not here to spend money and I was even looking into couch surfing or getting a little job, and that's when they started asking even more questions like asking where my work visa was but I told them I didn't have one and was hoping to get one from an employer, and most employers are only interested if you're actually in Ireland but they said that's not the legal way of doing it. They searched my bags and kept asking why I had so many rocks, they laughed at my Ireland for dummies book, my pictures from home they just tossed about and just made it seem like I was a criminal. I thought I had Wendy's [name changed] number from when she gave it to me a few months back but I guess I deleted the email. I showed them her info from Facebook so they called her family which I didn't want to bother them with but I think they were trying to get her number. I just told them that I'd be staying at a hostel and not with her but they made it seem like i told them she would be helping me out 100% which wasn't true. Of course she said she wasn't going to support me because I never asked, I kept telling them she was just an online friend who was out of town but when she came back we would hang out and when she had time sorta show me around. why they didn't understand that ill never know.

Now the fun begins. They decided to deny me entry due to insufficient funds, no work visa and no return ticket. They told me in the morning they'd send me on a flight back to London. In the meantime I would be taken to the local jail and put in a holding cell for the night. Two officers came who I have to say were very very nice and wished they didn't have to do that but I understood. They took me over to the small jail, booked me in and I slept on a cold dirty mattress on the floor with a hard blanket and with an open toilet in the corner. Couldn't take anything in the small cell. Again though all the officers were nice and checked on me through out the night. In the next cell though was a drunk who threw up a few times and made noises all night. they said he got drunk off beer, wine and too much whiskey. I couldn't sleep, even with the light off. it was cold, smelled like piss and I had to hear him next door.

So in the morning they took me back to the airport where I had to stay in another temporary cell till boarding back to heathrow. The heartbreaking part was cork was gorgeous. absolutely gorgeous. cool and crisp at night, and foggy wet and the greenest city I'd ever seen. I never got to really see it or even touch the ground. just the sidewalk. I was there and it felt like home. but I couldnt walk around or touch the soil or even breath in the air. It was just to and from the airport. it felt like I was literally living a dream in those 5 minutes in the car. But it wasn't.

So back to heathrow in London where as soon as I got off a customs officer approached me and led me away again. they wanted to know what happened in Ireland and I told them the everything but I did have a friend in western England who was nice enough to offer me a room at his home. again though they kept asking me questions, how much money did I have, did I know this person face to face and again went thru my two bags. this time I noticed my check in which had a bunch of selenite and that little vial of gold flakes I had I noticed they were broken. I covered them well but after they went thru it in Ireland I guess they didn't put it back like I had them so they just were destroyed.

Back to a temporary holding facility in heathrow I had to wait till they came to a decision, and 3 hours later they said I had to go back to the states. same reasons as Ireland but they didnt even care I had a friend in england who said I could stay at his place. they booked me a return flight to Dallas ft worth but because I didn't have a return ticket I had to pay £525 for it. I do have to say again the security officer who guided me around to the gate and all that was very nice and felt bad for me and kept trying to cheer me up. His name was Sandy.

That's it. I'm here in Dallas where I had to pay $350 for a hotel for tonight and tomorrow.""

He later writes that he might take a bus to stay with some relatives or hitchhike north. He is very heartbroken.

praisethedead,1645697780,/r/college/comments/t07lxj/need_help_with_a_friend_in_my_college/,"Hang on people. It’s about to get rough. 

So, I have this friend. Let’s call him “Tim”. I met him in school and we have been friends for a few years, we are both in the same music program in university. Tim doesn’t have a lot of other friends besides me. Maybe one or two, but I think friendship is something he struggles with. I’ll admit, his behaviour can be weird and childish sometimes (this could be due to a condition - I am not sure) and I can understand why other people in my cohort refuse to hangout with him and describe his presence as “annoying and uncomfortable”. I also realize this about Tim, but he’s got a good sense of humour, and I love playing music with him, so I’ve continued to stay in touch and hang out, trying to keep it casual.

Throughout the course of our friendship, Tim has become quite “clingy” and demanding of me. He always is asking who I am with, or what I am doing. He asks me for rides and favours all the time. He will call me, and message me several times a day, and if I don’t answer he just keeps going. When I answer, it’s not like he needs anything because he just tries to make casual conversation/joke around/ask me to hangout. He is always asking me to spend time with him, go to events, etc., but I am busy, I have several other friendships to maintain, a girlfriend I just started seeing, school, work, job interviews, house obligations, self care... you get the point, I am a busy guy. If I decline his offer to hangout, he asks why I can't hangout, or picks at my excuse instead of just accepting it and moving on.

I think he is also jealous of me. I am not even sure where to begin handling that. I go on dates with girls sometimes, and he always tells me that he can never get girls to like him, and that hes hopeless, you know, all that incel shit. He also seems jealous of my other friendships, and my shitty old car (even though he has plenty of money to buy a car himself). Sometimes it seems like he is trying to convince me that my life sucks, I mean, its not great but I am getting by all right.

ENTER THE LAST STRAW:

On Monday morning he asked me to come over and record some music in the evening, and I agreed. I had the night free, and I love to play and record music with Tim. I messaged him that afternoon asking what time I should come by, and he replied with ""I'm tired"". I asked again if he wanted to record and play music tonight, and he said ""I thought you would already be on your way? Don't you know that you have your own choices in life?"". I called him on his B.S and told him that there was no need to be grumpy or rude, because I'm just trying to find out what the plan for the evening is. He was triggered by me calling him grumpy, and proceeded to call me disrespectful, and use every name in the book. Then, he calmed down and asked me to come over again, and I said that I don't want to hangout if he's in a bad mood. He started telling me that he is older than me (we are both mid 20s, I think he's 2 years older) and that I need to respect him. I continued calling him on his B.S, because I am an adult and who is going to put up with this shit. I told him not to talk to me like that, and to stop messaging and calling, and that I am not coming over. He proceeded to give me vague physical threats, tell me that he would have me kicked out of the university, and evicted from my apartment. He kept telling me ""you're done"", ""you are so fucked"", that sort of thing.

At this point I'm worried. Tim is going ballistic on me. He doesn't have any real dirt on me to get me expelled or evicted, but I don't want to deal with squashing whatever bullshit that he told the dean, classmates, or whatever. So after about 1 hour of what felt like dealing with an 5 year old, I managed to talk him down from his anger. He gave me an apology, blamed in on some condition that he has, which seemed sincere but I'm really not sure. I accepted the apology, because I am TOO DAMN NICE. Maybe I shouldn't have. I don't know.

Today he messaged me asking if I can do some errands for him, because he's stressed. Like... dude ... are you serious???? I said no and he said he would pay me, I still said no and he started going off about how he has a headache and how it'll take him 3 hours by bus to do his errands. Like thats my problem or something. I'm not sure if he thinks I'm supposed to be scared of him because of his tantrum on Monday, and just agree to do favours for him, or what. He also asked me to go to punk show with him tomorrow. I told him I'm broke and can't go, because I don't want to go, and its a free show, so now I don't have an excuse. I want to tell him that he has been a lot to handle and I'm fine staying friends, but I need some space especially after all the shit he's been doing. But, its like walking on egg shells because I don't want him to snap on me and threaten me with slander again.

Mother of God, that was a long post. Sorry, friends.

I have a strange jealous friend named Tim who doesn't understand boundaries, has threatened me with slander, and is causing me a lot of stress in my personal life.

_RE_TARDIS,1520210933,/r/college/comments/8222mf/i_would_like_to_warn_you_about_the_possibility_of/,"If you grew up anything like me, a large focus from age 5-18 was the prospect of going to college. Teachers at school would often talk about it. Parents would start to ask you around age 14 which college you'd like to attend. Your parents' friends ask you if you've made your decision and what your major will be. You make your decision. You leave your crying mother in the car as she drives away after dropping you off freshman year. You change your major. You change it again. You revert back to what it was originally. Graduation day comes, you did it! You passed with flying colors, barely scraped by, or did somewhere in the middle. Selfies with your friends group abound at graduation, all of you swearing you'll remain bestest friends for forever until the end of time, no matter what. Now, you're 5 months post-graduation working your 9-5 and it hits you. ""Man, this *sucks*"". What happened?

While it's impossible to nail down specific causes of this phenomenon for everybody, what I can nail down are some near-universal truths that I've came to realize in the 5 years since I have graduated. 

* Number 1: The lifestyle change can be very jarring. 

I can't remember where I saw it, but somebody said ""College is a weird time in your life because you're effectively an unemployed alcoholic but your parents are still proud of you"". I went from not worrying about having to pay for bills, being surrounded by friends, going to one three hour lecture every other day (rest of my classes were online), and partying every weekend to busting my ass at a ""grown up"" job in a new city with very few people that I knew. Post-college can be extra hard if you move to a new city where you don't know many people or if you go to a familiar city but your friends have all moved away. College is something that is so built up for so many people that once it has came and went, the smile quickly fades as you ask yourself ""So I have worked my whole life up to this point for this moment and now that it's over, what do I do?""

* Number 2: Maintaining friendships after college is much more difficult 

When you're in college, all you have time to do is study and hang out with your friends. You have thousands of people around your age that you have something in common with. A surefire way to introduce yourself is to ask somebody what their name and major are. Easy, right? You don't necessarily have this luxury post-college. 

When you graduate from college and move away from your friends, life tends to get in the way. People get boyfriends and girlfriends. People have babies. People get busy with their careers. People find other groups of friends in their town to hang out with. In college, you may have hardly had a choice *but* to make friends. However, afterwards, maintaining friendships can take *a lot* of work. If you're not careful, you can slowly fade away from people who you thought were going to be your life long friends and that can leave you feeling destitute. 

* Number 3: You change A LOT in your 20's (most of the time)

Most people will go to college starting around 18 and graduate when they are 22-25. Zach Braff, who played John Dorian on the TV show ""Scrubs"" has a very profound quote that I agree with whole heartedly. He said ""‎""I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties."" In my experience, that is SO true. You'll be constantly changing and evolving as you progress through your twenties, your mind catching up with your body. They say that your brain isn't fully developed until you're in your mid-twenties, and I for one can attest to that. As a 26 year old, I am NOT the same person that I was when I graduated a few years ago. I have evolved mentally, physically, and emotionally into a man that any parent would be proud of. However, that comes with a lot of perspective changing and lifestyle-alterations. 

* Number 4: You might realize that the field you selected to study is not the one for you. 

I spent years trying to make law-enforcement type jobs work for me, as a Criminal Justice major (hint; DO NOT STUDY CRIMINAL JUSTICE. Minor in it if you must, but major in something that will give you hard skills such as computer science or accounting). Corrections Officer. Private Investigator. Loss Prevention Detective. I jumped from one position to the next before I came to the conclusion that this field was NOT for me. This depressed the shit out of me because I felt like I was stuck. I did not have any hard skills to show and I was desperate to get out of the field. I remember flying home to visit my parents about 2 years after I graduated. We went out to a Mexican restaurant and I cried at the table because I was so hopelessly destitute about my job situation at that time. Now, through careful maneuvering and by going back to school, I have successfully transitioned into IT and I love it. If you do not like where you are career-wise, change it. It sucks having to start all over again from the bottom, but I am a hell of a lot happier than I was making 3x what I'm making now. 

As I said in the title, this is a story of the *possibility* of post-college depression. I do realize that many people will not experience this, but many people who I have spoken to about the matter have, including myself. 

The very very TL;DR of this post is that life after college is depressing and takes some adjusting to, friendships are something that you have to work at to maintain, and if you find out your major isn't for you, take steps to get out of that field.

IFinallyWantHelp,1332293881,/r/AskReddit/comments/r61yk/today_i_honestly_did_not_care_if_i_lived_or_died/,"Please help me askreddit.  Two weeks ago on my main account I made a huge cathartic post about my dysfunctional family and how it made me an emotionally unstable and detached person.  I wanted tips and strategies to help me deal with my issues so I could move on with my life.  Now things are much worse because of the drama happening in my family.

First I tried to post in in r/relationships (I wanted a way to heal the relationship between myself and my parents) but their mods took it down.  Second I took it r/askreddit but the mods told me to move it to r/IHaveIssues.  I posted it in r/IHaveIssues where it sat for days without a single response.  After Reddit failed me I called the National Suicide Hotline, the lady on the other end gave me another phone number to call.  The other number led me to counseling service in my city but the person on the other end was adamant about me walking in to schedule an appointment.  When all else failed I opened my contact list in my phone to see who I could call to basically pour my heart out, when I realized I wasn't emotionally attached to any of my friends I broke down in tears.  It was at that moment that I realized that no one cares; here I was with my back against the wall in the most emotionally vulnerable state I've been in my life and I literally had no one to turn to for support. 

In real life I am an incredibly charismatic person, but deep down I am self-deprecating, emotionally lonely, and destructive towards my relationships.  I've been able to suppress these 3 neuroses for several years but recent events in my family have caused them to bubble up again.  

At the heart of the issue, I believe, is that the only emotion I am familiar with is loneliness and the emotional pain of being the crutch of your family's really fucked up problems (my mom and dad try to play me to take their side).  I've never experienced love (hedonic, blissful, laughing-all-day kind of love I've only fantasized about)  and the only times in my life I have been 'content' was when I drinking with my friends.  Consequently because the only emotions I've ever experienced are painful ones, it is very hard for me to get past them.  They may be painful but they're the only emotions I have ever been able feel since I was 14.  I would rather feel something than nothing.  

This is dangerous behavior for me though.  I've already begun to isolate myself from my circle of friends in order to exacerbate my loneliness.  I've destroyed one relationship already.  And I was walking back to my apartment from college I stayed edge of the highway facing away from traffic silently hoping a vehicle would hit me.  I've scheduled an appointment with my first ever therapist but they won't be able to see me until next week, I can't wait that long.  I've been in this state several times before and it's only going to become much worse very soon before I begin suppressing these emotions (which take me about 6 months to do).  

As of right now I've begun sleeping as much as I can, which I know is a sure-fire sign of depression, but I could care less right now.  Sleep and alcohol and pretty much the only thing that numbs the pain.  

**At the very least I just want to know that people are listening.  At the most I need any kind of help to help me cope with my problems until I can see my therapist.  And I'm begging the r/askreddit mods to at least humor this post for a few hours, waiting for a reply is pretty much the only thing keeping me from taking another nap.**  

Edit 1: There's alot of really worried people here that I may potentially and purposefully kill myself.  I just want to ease anxieties and say that I am absolutely not selfish enough to do that.  What I was seriously alluding to was that I became indifferent to death, I really love life it's fun an exhilarating (maybe not now, but making plans to travel overseas gets my heart racing) but with the amount of bullshit happening right now in my life death doesn't sound too bad if the endless stream of negativity would just stop (the death would have be completely accidental though the idea of amplifying the sadness in the world by purposefully taking my own life breaks my heart just thinking about it).  Simply put I would never harm myself, whatever happens was meant to happen, probably the greatest danger to myself right now is that my survival instincts have been blunted. 

**Update:** I want to thank everyone for their support.  I sent a text message to my mom and dad basically poring my heart out about how I can't deal with their negativity anymore.  I would be more than willing to talk to them individually about their lives.  But I cannot talk to them if they want to talk about the other parent.  I also told them that if they love me they will wait until Saturday to call or text me until I can work things out. 

Anyways I'm coping until I can speak to a real therapist.  My goal everyday is to not to go to bed sad or angry.  I'm talking to friends on facebook who I don't go to school with to help me with this, this really helps because they can't see my obvious terrible body language. 

We'll see what happens Saturday and Tuesday though.  In the end I know I'll come out this as a more emotionally mature person capable of experiencing happy emotions.  Right now though I just have to push through the anxiety in my chest and general lack of will to do anything productive.  I just need to reignite the passion that I had in my life earlier, it's there I just have to find it again. ",AskReddit,Today I honestly did not care if I lived or died.

[deleted],1314156172,/r/AskReddit/comments/jsh35/alright_reddit_ive_created_a_complicated_and/,"I had recently begun seeing this guy (Let's call him Eric) who lives about 40 minutes from my college town. Although it was a rather premature relationship, it was definitely pretty serious. We were staying for days on end at each others' houses and he introduced me to his family and showed PDA in front of his family/friends (which, I came to find out, he never even did with his exgirlfriend of 6 years). We would spend weekend nights in the city, go out to the expensive bars and clubs, and overall just really enjoy each others' company. He is very sweet, passionate, caring, and very intelligent. He also is about 6 years older than I am... which is a little different for both of us but we connect fairly well. In all honesty, if I were to pursue this relationship, I could see it going very well. 

Well, I left early June to Mexico for a 6 week study abroad program and right before I left, he had me promise him that if anything happened with any guys while I was abroad that I would tell him. I promised. I never expected anything to happen and I don't think he did either, but it was precautionary since we weren't anything official. Just dating/seeing each other. Very casual.

Everything in Mexico was great. About the 2 1/2-3rd week in, I found out that one of the guys (we're gonna call him Bryan) in the program has this huge crush on me. So, being the awful partying young adult that I've become, I took advantage of this knowledge when we were drunk and I made out with him... very intensely. Being single, young, abroad, and every other excuse I can imagine, it was all innocent for me. Well... just before this incident, Bryan and his friend (Tom) had met these Mexican guys (they're brothers) while at a bar and I was introduced to them. So later that week I ended up drunkenly making out with one of the brothers (let's call him Pedro -- and for the record, I had never had a drunken hook up like this before Bryan. I'd only kissed people I had any serious interest in.) and both Pedro and Bryan had hickies on their necks from me... Pedro knew about me via Bryan and Tom and knew that Bryan had this huge crush on me so he knew everything that had happened already and was fine with us hooking up. Well, Bryan wasn't too keen on it. But that's not too important. So after the first hook up with Pedro, we start hanging out a lot. Like everyday after classes/comida and we're going out together with our friends and just enjoying life. Neither one of us had any intentions of anything serious, we both knew it was just drunken hooking up. Well, the school program ended but I stayed for a week and a half longer because I wanted to travel some more/spend more time in Mexico. During that time we hung out even more than before... it was all day every day. He would come over at like 7:30am before his college courses just to say hi and wish me a good rest of the day. So, naturally, feelings start to develop. Both of us were a mess the first few days after I'd left Mexico. He has some really serious feelings for me and I feel as if I just have some puppy love crush... but I'm just not sure?

So... I never got around to telling Eric what happened because the only means of communication I had while abroad was sending him messages online, like e-mail. And I figured that telling him via the internet was a really shallow thing to do. So I decided I would tell him once I got back to the States. Well... I arrived... and still haven't told him. I 100% plan on telling him but I have yet to figure out HOW to tell him and how many details to offer up. I'm not sure if I should wait until I move into my college apartment and he visits me... or if I should call him... or what. I really like Eric and am excited to be back home so we can resume our relationship but at the same time, with Pedro, we talk absolutely everyday via skype and although I try to pull back on the affection, he is very open with it and talks about how when he visits me and the friends he made (like Bryan and Tom, because we all go to the same college) that he's going to sleep in my bed with me (nothing sexual, just cuddle and cute stuff like that) but I have firmly told him many times that he's to sleep in my second bedroom on the futon. Pedro and I have discussed multiple times the boundaries of our relationship and we've agreed to just go about our own lives as usual until we meet up again and then we'll see how it goes. He is very much still hooked on me and my friends who are still in Mexico tell me how he always talks about me, smiles when he talks about me, etc.

So I'm really confused about many things:
1. Most importantly, how do I tell Eric and how much should I tell?
2. I still feel really cloudy on how my emotions and mine and Pedro's ""strictly friendship"" boundary mix.
3. I realize it would be really foolish, but I feel almost like abandoning something great with Eric to hope for something in the future (nearly impossible, I realize -- but I've been planning on an internship in Mexico for months now) with Pedro.
4. WHY AM I SO MUCH MORE INTO PEDRO THAN ERIC RIGHT NOW?!?!!?



TL;DR: Was seeing a guy in the States before leaving for Study abroad. Made brief commitment that I'd inform him if I hooked up with anybody. Hooked up with two guys abroad- failed to inform Eric. Many complications.

yawnmasta,1531784952,/r/college/comments/8zg5ic/advice_for_college_firstyears/,"I wrote this a while ago, intending it to send it to someone. Unfortunately, we despise each other now. But I didn’t want to waste this so I’m posting it here.

BOOKS:

Books in university are a massive money pit. I’ve heard of people spending close to a thousand on supplies and materials per semester. The reason being is that these books are extremely price gouging. New books typically cost upwards $100. What typically happens is that schools will attach an access code to the book where you will do your homework online. These access codes will cost between $50 and $120 in my experience. 

Suppose you go to the school’s book store and buy a new textbook and the access code. For some, it’d be easier to explain with the tangible example of my Gen. Chem 1 class. At my school, the textbook and the access code together were $300 new. I only paid $100. How? I bought an older edition of the book for $20 on Amazon and then went online and bought the access code from the site directly for $80. A really big price-gouging method that I’ve noticed is that schools will cut a book in half and sell them separately to two different classes. The first half of my $20 older and used book was completely identical the new textbook used in my Gen. Chem 1 class. The second half was completely identical to the Gen. Chem 2 class’s text book.

For classes like biology and chemistry, you’ll also need to buy supplies. Such as lab coats, goggles, etc. At the book store, you’ll find that they are extremely expensive here as well. You can spend $20 on goggles when you can spend far less at an equipment/tool store nearby. I saved almost a hundred dollars doing this.

Absolutely do not buy your books before class starts unless your professor has told you to buy these books and have them ready before class. What typically happens is that the first day of classes, the professor will go over the syllabus, then if there’s any time left they will start a lecture. However, you will not need a textbook for this. The professor will inform you of what you will need for the course, so you should buy the materials when you know you need them. If you run around buying textbooks from older students, you will get price-gouged. A student can sell you a $120 Physics textbook and tell you that he spent $200, but in reality, there’s an $80 access code that you will need to buy later.

If you like PDFs, pirate your books. I probably can’t link sites here, but you can find them fairly easily. 

CLASSES:

Do your research. Is this going to be a hard class? Is this class going to have a high workload? How much extra credit will be given out in this class? Will your grades be mostly determined by homework or tests? Most of this you can find through the syllabus. You can also ask older students for advice on the classes. If you plan on dorming, this can be quite easy. If you take some STEM classes like Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry, you’ll find that plenty of students will have taken those classes you’ve taken already and can give you advice. 

Build a study habit. Even if it seems too easy to study for. Build your studying habit. You do not want to get into more difficult and complex classes with the same “oh this is easy, I don’t really need to study. I can go goof off!” attitude. And if you do reach those classes with that attitude, it is very hard to break. So start early, begin studying. Build your discipline.

One thing that people don’t typically take advantage of are office hours. Got a question? Go office hours or email the professor. One very important advice is to go to office hours if you’re majoring in the department that the professor is in. By going to office hours consistently, the professor gets to know who you are. And if you’re in the same department, that is a massive bonus because if the professor likes you, you can use him/her as a reference or letter of recommendation to a program or job.

CAREER:

Building off of office hours, you should be looking at internships in the field you want to go to. Ask your professors if they know of any reputable internships around. If you share an amicable relationship with your professor, you can ask him/her to write a letter of recommendation or refer you to the program.

The internship will help you figure out if you actually want to continue in this field. I did an internship and realized that what I wanted wasn’t actually the complex and abstract but rather the practical applications. And so I changed my major from Physics to Computer Science.

Should you get into the internship, try to keep an amicable and competent relationship with your supervisor. Your supervisor will now serve to be an effective and very important reference in the future. Not only that, the people you meet will be apart of your network. You can ask these people for job opportunities in the future or as references to other jobs.

Apply to scholarships, as many as you can. Take the time to write essays that sell yourself (not literally) to the scholarship. You’re essentially taking an hour out of your day to apply to some scholarships that may or may not make you anywhere upward a few hundred dollars.

Figure out if you plan on going into a graduate program. Build your extracurricular classes to fit into those. Are you certain that you’ll get into this one program? Well fuck you because there’s no guarantee you’ll get into that one. Go apply to other programs and look at their requirements. The sooner you do, the more prepared you will be. Study for the exam you’ll need whether it be the MCAT or GRE or whatever. 
",college,Advice for College First-Years,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8zg5ic/advice_for_college_firstyears/,1531806552.0,school is too expensive,6.74
ABetterGoodbye,1336144205,/r/AskReddit/comments/t6x3x/i_dug_myself_into_a_hole_in_my_life_and_i_could/,"Hey there, Reddit. I have a bit of a story to tell about the mistakes I have made in the past year that have gradually brought me to the lowest point of my life thus far. It is all a bit jumbled, but it all adds up to where I am now. I apologize if it is a bit long.

All the way up through high school, I didn't have to try to do well in school. It was a walk in the park for me. I graduated high school with a 4.0 and was accepted to a university with scholarships that basically paid for everything, which is extremely nice because my parents cannot afford to put me through school. So I picked a college that was only a few hours from home and moved into an apartment with my two best friends. When the semester started, everything was great. I had over $4000 in the bank from leftover scholarship money, a job doing web coding from home, and classes that I really enjoyed. I also had a girlfriend of over 2 years whom I went home to see every weekend. It was great.

But it didn't last.

It started with the realization that I didn't always have to go to class since attendance wasn't a big issue. I didn't have anyone but me to push me to get up and go to class in the morning, so I didn't go all the time. It caught up with me though, and at the end of the semester, I ended up with a 2.89 GPA. I told myself that I would make up for it this semester by taking 19 credit hours. In reality, I could have really helped myself by doing this, but it only hurt. I started giving zero fucks about going to class and doing homework. Instead, I sat at home and played video games all day long, which I used my scholarship money to pay for. I actually ended up spending all of my scholarship money on a variety of things, from video games, to TVs, to $300 light sabers, to whatever the fuck I wanted. Did I mention I lost the job I had at the beginning of the semester? Basically, I ran out of money, and I killed my grades by not going to class. To add to it all, I've been lying to my family, my friends, and my girlfriend about my grades, so they all think I'm doing great. I'm not.

What I have yet to mention are my relationship troubles, but here I go! Basically, I have been living a lie for the past 3 years. I acted like somebody that I'm not around her, but I did it because she was my first girlfriend and I didn't want to lose her. She fell in love with me, and I convinced myself to fall in love with her. Besides that, in the first month of being with her, I cheated on her with a random girl I met at a camp over summer. I cheated on her again my senior year with a freshman. I cheated on her two more times over summer with a close friend of mine. And those are just the times that I got lucky enough to be able to cheat. The worst part is that the reason I have been cheating on her is because I don't love her. There was a time when I did, but I don't now. We just don't fit. She doesn't find me funny, she doesn't like that I play video games, she hates Reddit, she hates my roommate whom I have been best friends with for 12 years, she doesn't like to hang out with my family (now I'm ranting), and for some stupid reason, I can't seem to end our relationship and move on, and it is eating away at me.

Now I sit here at the end of my first year in college with no money, no job, and no scholarships. On top of that, I continue letting myself be torn apart by a relationship that I can't stand. Hey, but at least I have my games! I'm just tired. I find myself saying this quite a bit. I'm just tired. When people ask me what I'm tired of, I don't even know what to say. But I do. I'm afraid to admit it to myself, but I'm tired of life.

I am really unhappy right now. It's the main reason I play video games so often. They help me escape to a life that isn't this. But I can't do that forever.

Honestly, good people of Reddit, I am not going to kill myself. I am not going to start doing meth. I am not going to give up. But I sure as hell feel like doing all of it (in that order!). The worst part for me is that I feel like these problems aren't that big of a deal, and that my life could be a lot worse. I feel like I need a reset button, like I need to go back to the beginning of August and redo everything. But I can't. I have to push on.

This is where you come in. What can I do, Reddit? What do I do about school? What do I do about my girlfriend? I am just so lost, and I need advice, guidance, anything. I need someone to tell me to quit being a pussy and get back to work. I need someone to tell me that I'm not the only one who has been through this. I need someone to tell me that everything will be ok in the long run. Because right now, I don't feel like everything is going to be ok. I used to be so happy-go-lucky about everything.

Help me get back on my feet, Reddit?

TL;DR: I am broke, jobless, going to lose my scholarships, and I'm in a relationship I don't want to be in. Any advice?",AskReddit,"I dug myself into a hole in my life, and I could use your help, Reddit.",http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t6x3x/i_dug_myself_into_a_hole_in_my_life_and_i_could/,1336165805.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,6.713333333333333
Rhodesian_Tough,1470507799,/r/college/comments/4wh1zp/8_websites_you_should_know_if_youre_applying_to/,"(x-post I made to /r/ApplyingToCollege)

Hey guys! I've compiled this handy little list for you and weighed out their pros and cons. Some of these websites have overlap with the sidebar links, so check those out too!

**1. [The Common App](http://www.commonapp.org/):** Obviously. But what isn't so obvious is this site's helpfulness beyond the ""Apply Now"" button. The site is *jam-packed* with videos answering tons of questions that have crossed every applicant's mind. If you don't find content that answers your questions - you can tweet to their highly responsive [virtual counselor](http://www.commonapp.org/virtual-counselor). Clicking literally anywhere else besides the ""Apply Now"" button can actually be extremely helpful - and it's something most applicants miss. 

**2. [The College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/):** Now look, I know the site may not be the prettiest on the *outside*, but I beg of you to give it a shot, and you will definitely change your mind. This site is absolutely golden if you're struggling to find universities which suit you. It has an easily accessible [database of statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/SurveyGroups.asp?group=2) to help guide you through the first stage of applying: choosing your university. And let me tell you, it really isn't always Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, or MIT - even though they may come to mind at first.

**3. [IvyApps](http://www.ivyapps.org):** Alright, alright. Let's say you're a big shot and want to apply to one of these top universities. One of the most helpful resources I found during the application process was a database of full applications and essays that were accepted from previous years. IvyApps has a database of over 20 full applications and over 60 essays accepted to top schools. [Here](http://ivyapps.org/essay-got-into-5-ivy-leagues/) is one of their essays which was accepted to **FIVE** Ivy League Universities. Reading essays isn’t for everyone, and if you think it isn’t for you, I still recommend you take 5 minutes out of your schedule to give it a shot! 
*Payment Warning*: Their other content does cost money to access ($14). 

**4.  [Federal Student Aid](https://fafsa.ed.gov/):** So as most Redditors know, US university is expensive. Like, [REALLY](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years) expensive. And since not all of us are heirs to cottages in Martha's Vineyard, we all have to find a way to save money. FAFSA is a really good website which can tell you what scholarships and aid you are eligible for. The first thing you should do, before you even put pen to paper and draft your essay, is sit down with your parents and have a talk about money. After the talk is over and they develop ulcers over tuition prices, show them FAFSA, and be their financial hero of the day. You may be surprised at how much financial aid you are eligible for.

**5. [Good 'Ol Sal Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat):** By now, everyone should recognize the soothing and supple voice of the one and only Sal Khan. I mean, he's probably the only reason why any of us got grades good enough to even be *eligible* for college. But it turns out Mr. Khan now teaches just a little more than algebra and economics; he's teamed up with the College Board to produce lessons specifically designed for the SAT. So sit back, relax, and press play as you learn how to ace the SAT. I highly recommend Khan Academy, and as I like to say: a video a day keeps the anxiety away!

**6. [CollegeExpress](http://www.collegexpress.com/):** It's all about the money. And beyond financial aid, it turns out you can save even more money - yeah you heard me - MORE. Just by having hobbies and being good at school. CollegeExpress has been the best search engine for scholarships in the USA that I have found so far. A little clacking of the keyboard and *voila!* Thousands of dollars at your fingertips. I really do recommend you check this out, because way too few people actually make use of the free money, all because they were too lazy to write a few hundred words. I can assure you that if you've survived high school you sure as hell can survive a few extra hours on the computer.

**7. [yconic.](https://yconic.com/):** Simply put - this is the Canadian version of CollegeExpress, but in my view, it is much more easy to navigate and use. The landing page says it all - over a hundred million dollars are available to you if you spend a few minutes on the site. Few minutes on site --&gt; few thousand in savings, now that is some return on investment a hedge fund manager would beg for.
*Side Note*: I'm literally not exaggerating when I say you only need to spend a few minuted on the computer - some of these scholarships only require you to put in your name and email. Now that's cool!

**8. [The College Board](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat?navId=gh-sat):** If you’ve made it all the way down my post - congratulations, you’ve earned the reward of the most stressful yet helpful website on the list. The College Board is the hub of *ALL* relevant standardized tests: from APs to SATs to SAT IIs (yes those exist). What I recommend you do on this website is the following: make a checklist for yourself. Research all the standardized tests they offer and make a list of all the ones you need. Add registration dates to your calendar, and if you haven’t done so already, **MAKE A CALENDAR**. You don’t know how many kids wait until the last minute to study or register - make this your first move in setting yourself apart.

jkhso,1514419531,/r/college/comments/7miwi1/10_things_i_learned_during_my_first_semester_of/,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a good break! I just finished my first semester of college and wanted to share few things I personally learned. Hopefully this can help current and future students!

&amp;nbsp;

**1. College is damn expensive**
&amp;nbsp;
College is expensive, and I think everyone knows that. Regardless of whether your parent are paying for them or you're getting a loan, do not waste money by not giving 110% effort. You are there to to learn and succeed, not to go out every night and fail classes. I'm not saying you can't have fun, but make sure you set your priorities straight before it's too late. If you're getting a loan, I think you should sacrifice more 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Talk to your parents often**
&amp;nbsp;
We are probably all enjoying this newly found freedom in college without our parents being on our ass 24/7. Although this might be nice, you will most likely never see them as often as you did in high school. Always make sure to let them know you love them because soon they might not be here anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Hard work will beat intelligence** 
&amp;nbsp;
Some people are naturally smarter, and it really does suck. But don't let this be an excuse to lowering your expectations. I have met so many people who aren't naturally smart but has worked extremely hard to get A's.  Also, if you're smart don't rub it in. It's pretty douchey. 

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Find what studying style works for you**
&amp;nbsp;
Just because your friends study a certain way doesn't mean it will work for you. I wasted the first month of my college frantically taking notes and realized that I'm just spitting the what my professor said onto a paper rather than trying to understand it. And most of them time, the professor will post lecture notes online. Finding what worked for me helped me save a lot of time.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Don't skip class**
&amp;nbsp;
Like I said, college is expensive. It might not feel like it, but you're wasting so much money every time you're skipping class. Even if you don't think it's helpful, go. Form new relationships and get to know the teacher. Who knows, you might end up needing to ask for letter of recs from the teacher of the class you always skipped. 

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Get out of your room**
&amp;nbsp;
Do not stay in your room all day. There are so many people in college, there is someone who you can connect with. Make some friends. Find a date. Do something other than being in your room all day. It's not healthy and you will regret it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**7. Find some sort of activity that will keep you or get you into shape**
&amp;nbsp;
Exercising is not only good for looking good but it will help you get better grades and stay healthy. Don't let yourself get out of shape because it's hard to get back in. Plus it's not attractive :P. Stay fit. It's good for you.

&amp;nbsp;

**8. Partying/drinking is not ""cool""**
&amp;nbsp;
As everyone probably know, partying and drinking is huge in college. I'm not against them, and I personally think they can be fun. But I do have a problem with how they are praised to be ""cool"". Like some kids think it's ""cool"" to get plastered and black out and puke. They brag to their friends next morning about how ""hard"" they went and people praise them. Honestly, this is not the case. Remember if you're only doing things to look ""cool"", chances are, you're probably not cool lol. Also, everything in moderation. 

&amp;nbsp;

**9. Keep your integrity and don't lose yourself** 
&amp;nbsp;
You will probably change drastically throughout college. I know I did. But make sure you don't lose sight of who you are. Sure you might find new hobbies and interests, but don't be someone who you're not. Don't cheat on homework or test because you didn't study. Don't be an asshole because you think it will make you look cooler. Don't fall under peer pressure. Always make sure you put school on top of the priority list. Just be responsible.  

&amp;nbsp;

**10. Have fun! Socialize! Gain new perspective and learn about new cultures!** 
&amp;nbsp;
These are 4 years of life you will never experience again. If you regret doing or not doing something in high school do it! If you like a guy or a girl, ask her out! Don't be a Pu**y! If you want to be more outgoing, be more outgoing because you are starting fresh. So is everyone else! If you think it's weird to talk to people in class or anywhere, you're wrong. I'm sure you would love if people came to talk to you! Don't only talk to people you are comfortable with. Talk to all kinds of people! It will help you become a more complete person!

&amp;nbsp;

**11. G.P.A. is just a number**
&amp;nbsp;
I'm not saying don't get good grades, but make sure you're not killing yourself over a 4.0. Although a good G.P.A. is helpful, recruiters look at your people skills and experience. I managed to get an internship as a freshmen year  even thought I don't have a college G.P.A. thanks to my ability to talk to people. Become a well rounded person and don't pull hairs for a silly number! (People seem think I'm saying GPA doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You should always aim to have a high GPA. I'm just saying, don't kill yourself because you got a 3.9 over a 4.0.) 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading guys! I just wanted to share my thoughts about college. This is purely my opinion so please don't think this is what everyone thinks. If you agree or disagree, I would love to talk about them! Feel free to ask any questions! Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I didn't proofread lol.

frustratingbrother,1336817371,/r/AskReddit/comments/tji32/fiances_brother_is_a_good_for_nothing_who_is/,"This is probably gg to be a long post and I'm relatively new here so sorry if this is in the wrong place. We (the fiance and I) need some advice, even though we are grown adults (27, 29). This has dragged on for years, and his parents are about to break down or break up because of it. He's lived with this turmoil since his undergrad days and it has caused him a fair bit of mental anguish (and scars if I may add)

Long story short: His brother behaves like the stereotypical spoilt brat asshole kid of the family. His brother has always been the baby in the family, being 6 yrs younger than him. Always got his way. Parents spoilt the crap out of the boy. Fiance's family is not well off. They live in a house they are still paying off the loan for, which I understand is quite common in the US. (Not so much in Asia, where I am from). My fiance took out a student loan for college which he has worked hard to pay off himself. His brother asked their parents to take out a loan for him to pay off college in NYU. This is wayyyy more expensive than the other college he could have gone to, which was UCLA (they are Californian). The dad is part of the problem as far as I have heard. He defends the brother and makes lots of promises he cannot keep, things like, he will always find the money to support his son in whatever he chooses to do and that is his responsibility as a parent no matter what. Now they are stuck with an 80,000usd loan to pay off for the brother. The brother rents a 1000usd room in an apt in a nice part of new york. He interns at some company for free. FREE! While his parents worry about how to support him from California. They pay all of his rent, and give him about 600 more to live on. They cannot afford this. All this while, the brother refuses to work for money even though he can (saying that he would rather pursue his dreams being poor than work for money). He also refuses to consolidate his loans, knowing full well his parents are the guarantors and they will eventually have to take care of things. This pisses the fuck out of all of us. His parents are now about to take out another loan on their house to pay off his student debt because the interest rate would be more favorable this way. Meanwhile the brother refuses to talk about his loans or his problems. And he is refusing to find a real job.

He did finally agree to TRY to sublet his NY apt out and move home, but who knows if he is actually trying. THis boy has been nothing but irresponsible and self-centered (from what I've heard). 

All this has taken a long and destructive toll on my fiance. He is sick and tired of the family drama, of his dad not knowing any better and his mum having to take all the shit but cannot and coming to him crying. He says sometimes he wishes he could just shoot everyone in the family and shoot himself (but I know he is just saying this in frustration and will not do it - he is a medical student now and wants to save lives more than anything). 

My fiance is in debt himself as he took out another loan for his medical school. He is in no position to help his brother or his family out financially. He stresses out about this constantly, and even more so each time his Mum calls to pour her heart out. He loves his family. Meanwhile, his brother sits on his lazy ass doing god knows what and avoids everything.

Latest news is, the brother grew some acne on his face and now hides at home for fear of someone seeing him. This is his excuse now for not going for any job interviews. 

My fiance suspects that his brother is gay. He also recently thinks that his brother could have some sort of psychiatric illness, like body dysmorphic disorder, or maybe some sort of personality disorder. I personally feel that could be the case too, because which normal human being can act like such an asshole and feel no remorse? They have no money to send his brother to see a psychiatrist. No insurance nothing.

I'm sorry that this was so long. While I don't actually feel any better by venting, I really hope someone can offer some advice on what to do. Maybe someone in the same situation before, or counsellors, or anyone! I am not going to lie, I am quite afraid of the future when my fiance's parents won't be around to take care of his brother's problems anymore and he will have to pay off all the debts...and whatever other situations the brother always seems to get into. Because of his brother, my fiance has sworn off having kids. He is going to get a vasectomy to make sure this never happens. I am not going to lie that I am happy about that in any way.

TLDR: Fiance's brother is an asshole and sucks money from the family, refuses to work, but may have a psychiatric illness to account for his bad behavior. What to do?

edit: the part about the brother being gay - added that because we think it might be why he acts out like this. He has identity problems... and grew up having them and now chooses to avoid all the problems in life. Fiance is making a trip to new york in a month to try and ask the brother about this. Because...we don't give a damn if he is gay or not. We just want him to be a normal, productive, responsible member of society (and the family).",AskReddit,Fiance's brother is a good for nothing who is cleaning out his parents' savings.

confused_with_life,1349734606,/r/AskReddit/comments/115tsq/reddit_i_seem_to_be_stuck_in_my_life_right_now/,"I posted this 12 or so hours ago. A friend suggested I repost it for different opinions.


Hello, Reddit. I’m a 21-year-old woman from Virginia. And, I’m afraid I need some help. My life is currently at a standstill and I can’t seem to find a way to change anything in a manner that is healthy. It’s becoming unbearable and I am in desperate need of outside advice.


My family and I live with my grandmother on a dirt road. I am the only person in the house that has a job. I work for pennies over minimum wage, 2-3 days a week, 5-6 hours a day, at a McDonalds not too far from here. My mother receives government aid in the form of SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid. However, the insurance does not extend to me because I am too old. My younger brother is covered for 3 more years and my sister has a few months left, as they are 16 and 18. When my sister turned 18 and started taking classes at a local community college satellite, she was no longer covered as a dependent in SNAP, so the total household food budget is not enough to keep everyone fed. My money goes straight to food and other necessary items such as underwear, etc. that my grandmother can’t cover for us. My checks are usually gone within hours of their deposit.


I have major depression. I first began medication for my depression when I was 17 and still covered under my mother’s Medicaid. I have since been ‘kicked’ from the system because I am too old. I called the social services office for my area and was told that I could only receive some kind of medical assistance if I was pregnant or already had a child, neither of which I am/have. I have a terrifying medical debt hanging over my head from seeing a doctor for this depression and trying different medications to get rid of the symptoms, which varied in cost from 20$ a bottle to 100$+. The last medication I was on was really ineffective in the treatment of my depression, but, because of the giant medical debt, I can’t go back to the doctor to get something else to try. And, even if I could, the medicine might be way too expensive for me to budget into my little paychecks. The depression is a huge weight on me. There are days I can’t even get out of bed. I have panic attacks bi-weekly at least. I’ve even considered suicide and harmed myself physically.


Money is an obvious issue. So, I figured that I should get a second job to help get rid of the scary debt and maybe even build up some savings. We live in a rural area and the jobs are slim to none out here. My best bet for getting hired somewhere else would be to travel into town. However, I lack a driver’s license. My mother takes me to and from work. I had a learner’s permit, which has since expired, for a few years. I don’t really have anyone to teach me how to drive. I have read all of the books, I know what the signs mean, but I have less than 4 hours total experience behind the driver’s seat. So, I need more practice. But… there is only one car, and it’s my grandmother’s. It’s her pride and joy, she’s even named it. When asked if I could practice driving on it, let’s just say that the reaction was negative. I’d like to get my own vehicle, but, again, I am the sole worker bee in the family.


My mother won’t work. She also won’t take classes or work towards any kind of certification, even though she could probably get grants, to learn a trade for a not-basic job. When asked about this, she completely shuts down. She refuses to talk about it and is completely content to use the government, myself, and my grandmother for all of her needs. My father is not in the picture, and, even if he was able to assist me in any way, would not. My younger sister refuses to work from pure laziness. She’d much rather mooch from my grandmother and me. My sweet, little brother is in High School, in all advanced classes, and does homework for hours a day. My grandmother is 70 years old and, without us living in her house, would be more than okay with social security and things left from my grandfather when he passed.


So, at this point, I’m unmedicated, broke, unable to drive, in debt, and grasping at straws for ways out of this situation. The current situation in which I live is extremely unhealthy and taxing on me both physically and mentally. I have big dreams. I want to move across the country to Colorado to attend a college out there and become a chemist. I want to make the medicines that people like me need to take so that they feel better and can do whatever it is that their hearts and dreams desire. I realize that those particular goals are out of my reach right now. So, for the moment, I just want to leave my grandmother’s house, maybe finally assert some independence, but I can’t because of money issues and medical debt. I want to get a second job so that I can get rid of some of those money issues, but I don’t have a car or a means of getting further than the McDonalds where I already work. I can’t get a car because I don’t have enough money and I also don’t have a license or any actual practice driving a car. I can’t seem to find a way to make it out of this vicious cycle on my own. Please, does anyone out there have any advice for me?

elcapitanful,1595606492,/r/college/comments/hx4dqe/50_of_whatever_tuition_you_pay_is_the_experience/,"Going onto my junior year at 20. My neighbor colleges have all decided to go online, however in my college (based around NJ) is going in person for the first few months until November where we will go full online. Besides that the classes will mix between half online/in person, online, and so on and so forth.

**My argument is despite the small talks with the science majors, the awkward hook ups at parties, the parties, or whatever social community you create - the college online subscription starting at $1,000/month is not worth it to me.** 

I have four main points and hope you will see agreement in my argument or otherwise understand my point of view.

**1 ) TRAINING/LEARNING**

Now this may not apply to more academic and online-friendly majors, but I am a performing arts major so I imagine some of you may even feel the want for an in person experience despite whatever you are training in.

As an oppose I can imagine that employers would take liking to see how prospective employees managed to be efficient during a challenge like this. This may indeed work in your favor.  In auditions, they don't give a shit - they just want your monologue.

One very important note for everyone to understand : YOU KNOW the teachers are not prepared. NOT THE UNIVERSITY, NO ONE. NO ONE WANTS TO WORK LIKE THIS. You know deep in your heart that the teachers are now unaware because they never trained for it and never had this challenge in their college days. They will half ass, and you will lose a day of fluid training over internet connection issues, let alone over the internet.

**2 ) COVID TRACING**

COVID isn't time traceable. It is getting worse, and more contagious. Yes, have everyone masks and test bi-weekly. Have them come every 14 days to quarantine, shut every interaction down. Will that stop family members? Will that stop me from meeting a friend outside of college? Is ignorance not possible?

Our college plans on returning online in November..however there is no exact projection of how COVID will hit this fall.

1 person. 10. 40. 100. Boom. School's closed. Can't open again until next year.

**3 ) COLLEGE EXPIERIENCE/INTERACTION**

College, like high school, helps you build a sense of community and interaction amongst yourself. It's like the movies, or at least it can be - wild, depressing, social, freeing. Besides that, everyone non stop talks about connections, making friends, and such. With COVID, even with going back to school for the small time, I don't think anyone would bother talking with anyone over fears.

When I graduate - I am not exactly guaranteed that anymore. As an acting major, we're not guaranteed the ensemble or a cast. We have to work - VERY HARD - to get to that and on top make a living from it. I'd move out, and have to start applying. These moments we had in college we had to work for. I could - WE could get rejected and never return to the community we are seeking for longer than anticipated. This applies to all majors - as we can't take internships for the rest of your lives. I couldn't respect myself having to live with my parents and not create an independent structure in my life. For the time I have - I just want to live in a space where I can fully create, find happiness, and **get the money's worth.**

The zoom-bombings and the ego-boost of online is another thing

Zoom-bombings are it's own thing and thankfully has died down a bit (I guess it was hitting the summer so maybe it might come back..)

The digitalized era has made it that it's easy to fuck you to a teacher instead of their face. However, this isn't the case once you graduate or even in person. You're at work, and vulnerable. You are seen in person, and not over a screen. Your hair strands and dead face is fully in the pale light. You're on stage in front of 30 people, and vulnerable. If you cry, they will see it. Is that something to be embarrassed? In the moment, but will it make you stronger?

That's the challenges we take for granted in college. The times we fuck up or triumph becomes far greater in person. You become your real self because there is no place to really hide when you're there. Online you could just turn off your video.

Point is, even back to earlier, we become better, stronger, and more ""real"" by existing in person. Not to sound dramatic, but we are surrendering to the digital that we complained of so much. Now imagine returning back after months of online.

**4 ) POTENTIAL OF GAP YEAR**

If a vaccine hypothetically comes out in January, and the country gets their shit together, the opportunities from before will return. You could even just travel in the countries we all reside in. We could volunteer at peace corps. Learn to play Clair De Lune. Run a marathon (I just ran a 5k three days ago, 13th place. Trained during quarantine.) No complaints if you spent it speed running Majora's Mask or stayed at home.

This may not even apply to some of you, as you need the degree now or just want to finish it. I just ask you that you ponder this over. I am an enemy to the college state yes, but I just think we all deserve the fullest potential of our life, young or mature.

It may seem like one year, and with talks of a vaccine maybe less, but it may not be one year for all of us. It could be an eternity of happiness that could be right there. RIGHT there!

MarriedtoMurder,1330653108,/r/AskReddit/comments/qdtyr/i_just_watched_my_friend_breakdown_in_tears_this/,"I've written longer posts about a lot less here on Reddit. Right now I'm witnessing the Government screw with my good friend, all over a gram of keef (the shake from a marijuana plant). 

My friend, Alfonso is a standup guy and he just had his first child 2 months ago (he's 25). Al's a big stoner, always has been since high-school, but he's maintained steady jobs and never gotten into any trouble. About a year ago he got his Marijuana Rec card here in CA and began going to dispensaries. Last month he had purchased a gram ($20) of keef, which is the powdery shake that accumulates from the large bags of weed at the dispensaries. One day while he was outside of his house in his friends car, a cop just walks up to the car and says that he ""smelled"" marijuana smoke. When the cop asked if it was okay to search the car, Al's friend said yeah because they both thought that Al's rec card would cover him for the marijuana that he had purchased at the dispensary.

Well, when the cop found the keef, they said that it was hash, and therefore a concentrated form of MJ. Thus, they considered it a controlled substance, akin to cocaine, heroin, speed, etc. When Al mentioned that he had his documentation in the house (card wasn't on him), which they were right outside of, the cop replied ""it's not my job to make sure you have your papers"". They arrested Al and brought him to jail. While he was going through the system, on the third day an officer told him that since the system was so backed up that Al could (wink, wink) have to wait up to 9 months to see a judge about this matter. Since Al and his girlfriend just had their child a month prior, he took the only realistic option on the table and signed his rights away to plead guilty to having a controlled substance, which automatically labeled him a Felon, and put him on 3 years probation. But, he was able to leave, go home and see his baby.

Right off the bat, Al was given a probation officer and was made to attend nightly N/A classes on a program called ""track one"". He sits in this old, run-down building and has to listen to horrid stories from ex heroin addicts, tweakers and generally fucked up people. Well, on track one Al has to call a hotline number each day before noon to see if his name has been randomly selected from a pool of people to piss test that day. One week after he was released from jail his name was called, and he pissed hot. What the fuck, of course he pissed hot within a week, THC doesn't get out of your system for up to 30-45 days. But, still - he had to go see the judge that week who ALMOST put him on Track 2, which requires a $2,000 fee and one must attend two forms of N/A classes per day, for 9 months. But, the judge told him - ""Although I'm disappointed in you, you get one more chance"". I know that Al has not been smoking because even though he's been a stoner for a very long time, even the sight or smell of weed freaks him out now. If he pisses hot he COULD go to prison. 

Today, 30 days in his name gets called again. He goes back and piss tests thinking he'd be okay now. Nope. He pissed hot again (still within 30 days). The ""tech"" at the ""lab"" (shitty building, again) informs him that although there are ways to test for levels of THC in the body (to see if someone is actively smoking), it's too expensive so they don't test that there. The tech calls up his PO (who Al hasn't even met yet it's been so recently), and she says ""put him on track 2. One more violation he goes to prison"". I know that my friend fucked up by listening to the DA who told him that it was either the deal on the table or 9 months - but put yourself in my friends shoes. Not well versed in the (45 days for speedy trail) - 1 month old baby at home, and he thought that when he went in front of a judge that his reccomendation card would suffice - would be enough. 

Also, last point - on the mention of thinking the judge would say that his rec card was enough: Under some new law, Al needs to go to his doctor to get a $200 form signed in which the doctor states that there are ""no other suitable alternatives to THC"" that Al could be taking while on the drug program. This is the only way Al can think of having some defense, or protection from the piss test sticks which keep turning up hot - which even the techs admit is valid due to THC leaving the body within 45. But still... bureaucracy. Money making schemes. All of this has led my friend to turn into a felon within a month of having his newborn boy. When we were driving home he just broke down in tears saying how fucked up this all is. Gesturing with his hands to his head like he was going to blow his brains out. I mean... they've put him through the ringer in such a round-about way, we just don't know what to do. He has no money to pay a lawyer after all of these programs, fines, fees and shit he's had to pay. Is there anything we can do? I'm sorry if this post came out poorly written, I'm just stressed, too.

Licetnemi_429,1530152670,/r/college/comments/8ufkvi/change_the_major_change_the_program_what_should_i/,"I've been befuddled for ages if I should change my major or program and would appreciate any advice and helpful thoughts. It had always been my dream to pursue a career in the art/design field. However, in high school, I also developed an interest for health and nutrition. I ended up doing volunteering work in a hospital to get a sense of what it was like to work in a hospital setting.  I've wanted to go into art/design for decades but also didn't know how I would use that medium to help people or contribute back to community/society. I thought that being a doctor would make me feel more useful? Anyway, I was sitting in the hospital one morning and had this moment when I suddenly realized that the hospital building was just as important as the doctors and staff members who were helping patients, which lead me to the field of interior design. It was almost like a bridge that combined art&amp;design and health&amp;science?

I also did some volunteering work in a museum setting and fell in love with the museum environment. I mainly wanted to do exhibition and healthcare design. There's something about exhibition design that makes my heart sing. There are times when we're enter a space and we're just so astounded and captured by the surrounding that we forget our worries or problems. I really want to  recreate those moments and design spaces that bring comfort to people and promote collaboration. I think our memories are one of most important things when we grow old in life. It would be amazing to create spaces that people can remember and treasure for a life time.

With that said, I'm currently in my sophomore year of college and  I feel a bit inadequate as a design student and artist. I'm learning everything that's being taught  and my grade for the major-related classes aren't sinking like the Titanic. On paper, it makes sense to take interior design to go into exhibition design. However, internally, I feel useless and I don't think I've improved my design skills. Every assignment assigned require effort and time. I would not call the work easy but it's more of that I'm not being challenged in a way that would make me think critically or grow.  When I took art classes in high school, I was introduced to conceptual thinking and there was so much more room to be creative. I also just really enjoyed the process of art making. When I'm doing interior design work, there are times when I'm inside a computer lab just working on floorplans/sections/layout for long hours. I've stared at a screen for 15+ hours straight before. If an architecture student is reading this, I probably sound like I'm complaining right now. But when you're staring at the screen for that long, you just can't help but to start questioning your life.  Interior design becomes more of this muddy state between fine arts and really technical work. It's certainly important to master the tools required for any field to be successful but I find that I'm not enjoying this particular type of technical work.  In fact, I start to feel like robot just pressing keys on the keyboard with a lack of creativity. It's very bland work. 

I also want to clarify that there is a difference between fine arts and design. There is more individualism in fine arts where as the requirements and standards have to be met in design. I enjoy painting/drawing as hobby but I don't see it as a sustainable source of income for me. I'm aware I want to pursue design and not fine arts. I'm in this place that I'm suppose to be but I don't know why I'm not completely fulfilled on the inside. I wish I was happier. I think for months, I've been trying to reject my feelings of not fully enjoying the work. The job growth for interior design is lower than some other fields but I chose it in the first place thinking it was the perfect job that would make me happy, which didn't turn out to be the case. The program I'm in is a 4 year bachelor of science in interior design and not a Bachelor of Art which has a different curriculum.  The school is popular for cs/engineering major but the interior major is accredited by CIDA. Since I'm not completely fulfilled with my education, I've been debating if I should transfer to a different program or if I selected  the wrong major. It's such a difficult choice because the atmosphere in the actual interior design workplace could vary from classroom setting. I may dislike some part of it now but enjoy it in the future(?)  I've also completed half of my degree. My school goes by  a quarter system which makes transferring out credits difficult/ maybe impossible. Moreover, a majority of my credits are art/major related which won't apply to other majors so I would have to be one or two years behind. It's totally normal to be changing majors and be unsure of what one wants to do in life.  While I agree with that statement, I also believe indecisiveness comes with consequences in terms of cost and time. Should I stick with my major to avoid paying tons of debt? Is it worth it to pay tons of debt to change program for  same major?  Or do I sound so unhappy that I should just change major overall?  Happiness is not guaranteed in any scenario. I can't say for sure that after the changes, I will be happier, which adds to the dilemma.  I was hesitant to share my mid life crisis on here so thank you for reading if you've read through the whole thing. Just thought it might be helpful to hear from other design majors or people who've changed career paths/majors. ",college,Change the major??? Change the program???

I'm sorry I haven't been responding to comments, I just got back to my place yesterday and so have been without a computer for about 24 hours. You all are right. Revenge is not the answer, as angry and hurt as I am. I need to be the bigger person, and get on with my life. So I guess the better questions would be not about revenge, but how can I help my mother without feeding into her neediness? And my second question has to do with her getting a divorce. I've told her, pretty much every time I talk to her, that she needs to pack her bags and leave. She says that she cannot afford a divorce, that right now, she ""has it made"" (wat) because the only bills she has to pay are credit card bills, which happen to be pretty high, and that she can't afford to pay for a lawyer, utilities and rent if she has to move out, nor can she pay what's left on the mortgage if she ends up getting the house. I've already told her that I don't want to testify against my father in court, and that she has enough evidence that she can bring in (hairs and semen on the blanket, I think she kept the finger nail she found in her bed). Any pointers for her regarding legal help? Again, thanks guys. ** 



Throw away account (obviously).

Here's the deal: I used to be in a band with my dad and this woman, we'll call her FatMulletLady, FML for short (that was not intentional haha). I was about 12 or 13 when we started playing shows, and was in it for about 7 years before I got fed up and left. She's been after my dad for years, even to the point where her parents bought her a house down the street from ours. Things got really shitty after I left for college. My dad was coming home late at night and ignoring my mom, going away for the weekends and not telling her where he was, and at the same time FML's car wasn't in her driveway the whole weekend my dad was away. Now shit has just plain hit the fan. I haven't spoken to my dad in three years, because I found some love notes between him and FML, made a bunch of copies, threw them in his face at his office, and said this little gem: ""Little girls always want to marry the type of man that reminds them of their daddy, but I sure as hell hope my husband is nothing like you. If you and mom are getting a divorce, you better get a hell of a good lawyer, and preferably one you're not screwing."" Maybe not the best choice of words, as he blames my mom now because my little brother and I don't talk to him, but we're not idiots-- he's completely different, looks and attitude-wise, and we've fucking noticed. This past christmas, he wouldn't even sit with us as we opened presents and left immediately after any lame festivities.

He treats my mother like complete shit. She doesn't have a lot of money because she bailed her brother out of jail and he hasn't paid her back a cent in 2 years. My dad starves her, refuses to buy groceries except for his own which he keeps at FML's house, and my mom is working three jobs to support herself, my younger brother, and to take care of her own mother. FML is disgusting, and evil. We live in a really small town, population 6000 when college is in session. No one, and I mean NO ONE likes this woman. She is a horrible lawyer, she's two faced, she's completely miserable, and my sister in law has even told my father that FML is not allowed around her and my older brother's house or their 5 kids. My mom is a masochist and has done some snooping around. She found FML's and my dad's hairs on a blanket in the back of my mom's truck, along with some semen stains. She washed it one week and left the blanket rolled up in the same spot, and the following Monday she found more hairs and more semen stains. Among this, she found the tip of a green fingernail in her and my father's bed, along with a pair of women's black socks, which did not belong to my mom as she only wears stockings. Hairs on my father's pajama's, pine needles everywhere from wherever they meet up, etc. etc. Details I really wish I didn't know, but what can I do.


Anyway, I really want to do something horrible to this woman. I have never met someone in my entire life who just makes me go into a hulk-like rage every time I think about them, but this woman takes the cake. I want to know if there's any kind of SAFE, HARMLESS revenge I can take on this woman. I'd really love to ruin her life like she's ruining my family's, but I also don't want to get arrested (my dad is a cop, he found weed in my room once in high school and my mom had to intervene so I wouldn't get arrested, so if I do something jail worthy, I WILL get put away if he has any say in it.)


Please help me Reddit. My mom is in a really bad way, and my dad doesn't care about anyone in our family anymore, not even his own kids. I just want to do something that will wake him the fuck up.





tl;dr: My dad is fucking a really horrible woman and my mom is on the verge of killing herself, want revenge.

I wish to go to college for accounting, get my CPA, and work for the Big 4 or a mid-tier firm. I'm a money man myself; I love money, and I love learning the language of business. Hey, I even wanted to throw in another major as well, either in finance or data science (applied statistics). But, my dreams are essentially crushed for the time being because of my parents. Pardon some of the background information, but I feel like it is needed.

My parents are the epitome of the paradox of hard-working and laziness at the same time (no disrespect, just harsh honesty); they're both extremely intelligent individuals with college educations, but they choose to work menial jobs that a high school dropout could probably do. Together, they make around 60k a year. Doesn't seem too bad right? But no, they are spenders...very big spenders. Because of this, they literally saved $0 for my college. Not to mention, they will also refuse to do the FAFSA. I've tried numerous times to convince them, but to no avail, they are firm in their stance. My parents kept telling me that they would help pay for my college, but during my senior year of high school, they suddenly throw at me that they won't be doing it anymore. As a senior, this was a major shock to me because they changed their story 180 degrees. My father told me: ""If you want to go to college, you are going to have to pay for everything. We won't help you."" Another thing that is quite annoying is how my parents are also religious fanatics. They're extremely devout Christians who basically became extremely salty towards me all because I decided that I didn't want to do religious classes anymore. For example, just because I decided to stop doing religious classes, my father did not let me drive my own car anymore (for almost a year) as well as f***ing up my checking account (a lotta money that would have paid for 2 year of community college was ""gone""). Luckily now, I opened up a new checking account at PSECU (PA Credit Union) without any chance of my father screwing up my finances. That along with what I mentioned previous have left me incredibly disillusioned as well as hopeless.

So I applied to four local colleges, knowing my situation will require me to commute, not live on campus. I applied to Elizabethtown, Lebanon Valley, Penn State Harrisburg and HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College). I tried explaining everything to the financial aid officers, but of course, since a college education in America has nothing to do with smarts but all about how much money you can wipe your ass with, they didn't do much to help at all. Even telling them that the FAFSA was not going to be completed, they still did nothing to help me. Yes, even the community college is too expensive for me (parents won't cosign any loans).

So, I have a plan; if my parents aren't going to do much to help me pay for college, I guess I'm going to have to pick up the tab right? I plan to take a gap year or two, working a full time job as a bookkeeper as well as a part time job somewhere else (that is assuming I will get the bookkeeping job). I'm going to work to my fullest capacity as well as not spending a single cent from that checking account. Also, I will be retaking the ACT and will be aiming for a really high score (32-36 range). I didn't really know about the possibilities of financial aid through standardized tests until much too late, but better late than never right? My current SAT and ACT scores are 1220 and 27 respectively.

So, is a gap year or two (working a full time job as a bookkeeper and a part time somewhere else, as well as working my butt off to get a 32 or higher on the ACT) a good idea? I really see no other alternative other than the military at this point. But that's probably not an option either because I do have chronic asthma.

So please, after my giant block text of bleh, I was wondering if any of you could please give me some financial advice. I want to go to college and I know what I want to do, but the only thing that is blocking my way is money. Do you think my plan sounds good, or do you have other things in mind? Again, the crux of my plan is assuming I get the bookkeeping job, which pays 28k a year. I really hope to read your responses because as of right now, I am at the crossroads...and am completely and utterly lost. I feel physically and mentally drained from thinking about all of this...its extremely painful to me. I know I'm smart, but colleges don't really give a damn about that; all they care about is my check to them for ten-twenty f'ing grand!

Side-Note:Plus, if I am taking this gap year to garner money and improve my test scores, do you think I'd have a chance at Wharton?

After working for about a year I changed my major to Social work to eventually get an MSW which is a means to an end regarding my end goal of becoming a psychotherapist. I love psychology and truly feel like it's a passion of mine, so for the last 2 and a half years I've been taking social work classes part time while working full time.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently reevaluated my life plans, goals, values etc and came to realize that I no longer want to pursue this. mainly because the cons outweigh the pros. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: eventually landing a part time job as a psychotherapist (on top of my full time tech job which i plan on keeping for as long as I can) which may add meaning and fulfillment to my life. that's what i'm doing this for, to do something meaningful that will be fulfilling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: expensive. both time and money. I am paying out of pocket for my education. do I want to go into thousands of dollars of debt to pursue something that won't even be my main focus? if i plan to do this part time in the future, is it really worth the $$$ and time spent in class/clinical? is this really worth so much of my resources (time and money etc) to eventually land that part time gig so that i can  feel like what i'm doing is meaningful? my heart says no. my plan was to focus on working full time and getting that social work degree part time. but that will require about a decade (minimum) and up to a few decades of work.  granted, I get it. an education is important. but this isn't something i want to do full time, I wanted to do it part time on top of my full time job. I get that an education is important, and the future me is probably going to somewhat regret this but I think it's for the better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to enjoy my 20s and 30s and 40s. I want to work full time as a tech, come home to my gf (future wife and kids one day) and work on the house. the car. spend time with family. spend time with my nephew. I don't want to get out of work to go to classes and study for hours on weekends. leaving no time for other things I want to spend my time on. I don't want to go into massive debt for this part time gig plan of mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wishes that I stayed in college immediately after high school as to get that financial aid to help me with college. but that's not the path I took. I now have to accept that my income is too high to get financial aid but I still can't pay 800$ per class minimum (CC, when i transfer to a 4 year school it'll be more expensive. when i apply for my Masters even more so etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

but I do not regret my path. I'm glad I have a great start to my tech career. a great gf who just graduated as a nurse. I have a multiple family house that I recently purchased with my mom and sister living in the same building as me and my gf which is great (at times not so great but family is family haha). 

&amp;#x200B;

I think my attention is needed at home in the next few decades. I do not want to spend it in a classroom to eventually land that side gig JUST because ""it's fulfilling work"". not to bash social work, but for my personal situation, it isn't worth the money to get that degree, it isn't worth the stress that comes with jobs within the field. I got stuck with the idea that getting that degree is the only way to find meaningful fulfilling work, but that's just not true. I can find it elsewhere in the quality time spent with loved ones. in woodworking, in mechanical skills, in computer skills, helping my nephew learn and grow while also growing myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will continue to learn about psychology and will continue to apply that knowledge to myself to embody the lessons and to lead by example in hopes of helping other people through my actions etc. I may even volunteer in the future to find a niche that I find meaning and fulfillment. 

&amp;#x200B;

but for now, I am stepping away from pursuing social work. my path is leading me elsewhere and I am choosing to follow my gut. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since dropping my social work classes this semester, a weight has fallen from my shoulders. I feel like my horizon has broadened and many avenues for opportunities are being revealed to me. I have potential, but i know that's not enough. I must DO. I must do the work. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's ""the work?"". the work is to continue going above and beyond in my job (which recently landed me a promotion), it means to continue to develop my woodworking, mechanical, house maintence skills. ""the work"" means to spend more time with my nephew to help him grow. to spend more time with loved ones before their time (and my time) on this earth is over, to be more present. to kiss and hug my gf when I'm home. to cherish my time and to stop wasting my time by allocating too much of my resources for a goal that doesn't seem as worthwhile anymore. but that's okay. we live and we learn.

kaltag,1350755852,/r/AskReddit/comments/11t0pp/how_do_i_deal_with_my_moms_situation/,"Good morning Reddit. I am at the end of my rope here with family issues and I need some sage advice. This all started many moons ago when I was in elementary school. We were a happy family with no signs of trouble when one day my parents sat my brother and I down for a talk. They were getting divorced. Nine year old me was devastated. There was absolutely no indicator there was anything wrong with their relationship previous to this. Three days later my Dad is moving his stuff out and this is where the shit starts. Literally as he is taking his stuff out this new guy is moving his stuff in, as in they are walking past each other on the way in and out of the house. I didn't realize it at the time but to me this seems pretty fucked up. It wasn't until many years later I put 2 and 2 together here...

Problems started immediately with the new step-dad. Physically and verbally abusive etc. MY brother was the football star so he rarely got any of it. I was the shy nerd so I got the lions share of shit. (sorry don't mean to rant here just some background) I was perpetually grounded and beaten from 9 to 14 years old for the the most minor of infractions. I was effectively the house slave, doing all the chores for him and my Mom. During this my Mom and step-dad would try to keep me from visiting my dad. My mom did nothing to stop this.

My father was going through hell because of all this. He was blind sided by the divorce and my Mom wasn't making things any easier. I just recently found out she used my dad's credit card to buy her engagement ring to my step-dad and stuck my dad with the bill which took him years to pay off. She took his child support and bought a new car which I wasn't allowed in because it might get dirty. He took pictures of the bruises and cuts from my step-dad's abuse to the police but they did nothing. Once I turned 15 I was allowed to choose my guardian, so on my 15th birthday I moved in with my dad and literally lived in his bedroom closet because he couldn't afford to live anywhere else. He did the best he could to raise me and I only saw my mom at Christmas and and Thanksgiving. She made no effort to contact me so I returned the favor. 

Ten years later I started to have a change of heart. I started having lunch regularly with her and found out she had a kid with my step-father and had started her own landscaping business which was doing quite well. We worked on the relationship for several years and things were getting back to normal. I still avoided talking to my step-dad and any interactions were a sentence or shorter. This brings us to about 6 months ago...

One day my mom calls and asks to meet for lunch. Cool. So during this lunch I find out she is in financial trouble and is about to lose her house. Apparently she got used to the free cash from the child support for my brother and now that my brother had moved it had dried up. She asks if I know anywhere they can stay. They can't stay at an apartment because of all the landscaping equipment they have and none of the homes for rent have enough room for it all either. I talked with my dad and he agrees to let me move back in to his place and my mom can rent my house (it has a huge driveway and backyard for all their equipment) until they get financially stable. My mom accepts the offer with tears in her eyes and they move in the day of their home foreclosure.

Immediately things start getting rocky. She has become accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle and a nice house. Mine was built in the 70s and I am in the process of updating some things but it's still a ranch style 70s house at its' heart. One day I get a bill for $500 for ventilation system cleaning because the dust was giving her a headache, I had lived there for 5 years with no problems and she didn't even ask me before doing it. She didn't transfer the utilities to her name so I got blind sided with almost a grand in power, water, satellite bills that she didn't tell me about. She demanded a new water heater because the power bill she didn't pay was too high O.o and it just keeps going. 

The last straw was I just found out last week that they are giving my half-brother up to live with my full brother and his girlfriend. Apparently he was getting beaten too by my step-dad and ran away. They did not try to get him back so he is heartbroken now as well. They live in a 2 bedroom apartment and already have 2 kids. My brother is the only one working right now because they just had a kid a few months ago so I am helping them with that financially as well as my mom is no help. Now they are planning on bailing on the lease because they can't afford to live there even though they are pulling 6 digits. I lived there alone and got by fine on 1/4 of that income. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text and ranting Reddit but I have no idea what to do at this point? Preemptively kick them out? Call child services? Murder my step-dad (kidding....maybe)?

confused_with_life,1349679372,/r/AskReddit/comments/114lt0/reddit_i_seem_to_be_stuck_in_life_right_now_what/,"Hello, Reddit. I’m a 21-year-old woman from Virginia. And, I’m afraid I need some help. My life is currently at a standstill and I can’t seem to find a way to change anything in a manner that is healthy.  It’s becoming unbearable and I am in desperate need of outside advice.


My family and I live with my grandmother on a dirt road.  I am the only person in the house that has a job.  I work for pennies over minimum wage, 2-3 days a week, 5-6 hours a day, at a McDonalds not too far from here.  My mother receives government aid in the form of SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid.  However, the insurance does not extend to me because I am too old.  My younger brother is covered for 3 more years and my sister has a few months left, as they are 16 and 18.  When my sister turned 18 and started taking classes at a local community college satellite, she was no longer covered as a dependent in SNAP, so the total household food budget is not enough to keep everyone fed.  My money goes straight to food and other necessary items such as underwear, etc. that my grandmother can’t cover for us.  My checks are usually gone within hours of their deposit.


I have major depression.  I first began medication for my depression when I was 17 and still covered under my mother’s Medicaid.  I have since been ‘kicked’ from the system because I am too old.  I called the social services office for my area and was told that I could only receive some kind of medical assistance if I was pregnant or already had a child, neither of which I am/have.  I have a terrifying medical debt hanging over my head from seeing a doctor for this depression and trying different medications to get rid of the symptoms, which varied in cost from 20$ a bottle to 100$+.  The last medication I was on was really ineffective in the treatment of my depression, but, because of the giant medical debt, I can’t go back to the doctor to get something else to try.  And, even if I could, the medicine might be way too expensive for me to budget into my little paychecks.  The depression is a huge weight on me.  There are days I can’t even get out of bed. I have panic attacks bi-weekly at least. I’ve even considered suicide and harmed myself physically.


Money is an obvious issue.  So, I figured that I should get a second job to help get rid of the scary debt and maybe even build up some savings. We live in a rural area and the jobs are slim to none out here. My best bet for getting hired somewhere else would be to travel into town.  However, I lack a driver’s license.  My mother takes me to and from work.  I had a learner’s permit, which has since expired, for a few years. I don’t really have anyone to teach me how to drive.  I have read all of the books, I know what the signs mean, but I have less than 4 hours total experience behind the driver’s seat.  So, I need more practice.  But… there is only one car, and it’s my grandmother’s.  It’s her pride and joy, she’s even named it.  When asked if I could practice driving on it, let’s just say that the reaction was negative.  I’d like to get my own vehicle, but, again, I am the sole worker bee in the family.


My mother won’t work.  She also won’t take classes or work towards any kind of certification, even though she could probably get grants, to learn a trade for a not-basic job.  When asked about this, she completely shuts down.  She refuses to talk about it and is completely content to use the government, myself, and my grandmother for all of her needs.  My father is not in the picture, and, even if he was able to assist me in any way, would not.  My younger sister refuses to work from pure laziness.  She’d much rather mooch from my grandmother and me.  My sweet, little brother is in High School, in all advanced classes, and does homework for hours a day. My grandmother is 70 years old and, without us living in her house, would be more than okay with social security and things left from my grandfather when he passed.


So, at this point, I’m unmedicated, broke, unable to drive, in debt, and grasping at straws for ways out of this situation.   The current situation in which I live is extremely unhealthy and taxing on me both physically and mentally.  I have big dreams. I want to move across the country to Colorado to attend a college out there and become a chemist. I want to make the medicines that people like me need to take so that they feel better and can do whatever it is that their hearts and dreams desire.  I realize that those particular goals are out of my reach right now.  So, for the moment, I just want to leave my grandmother’s house, maybe finally assert some independence, but I can’t because of money issues and medical debt.  I want to get a second job so that I can get rid of some of those money issues, but I don’t have a car or a means of getting further than the McDonalds where I already work.   I can’t get a car because I don’t have enough money and I also don’t have a license or any actual practice driving a car.  I can’t seem to find a way to make it out of this vicious cycle on my own.  Please, does anyone out there have any advice for me?

TL;DR: I’m caught in a circle of fuckery! Wat do?

helloalicehello,1321933899,/r/AskReddit/comments/ml10n/im_an_art_school_graduate_and_ive_been_made_a_job/,"**TL;DR: I have an art degree, live in NYC, offered a full-time job as a retoucher for what amounts to $10/hr. I make that much at Starbucks. Low office morale, didn't feel welcome, 4-hour commute. Possibly have the chance to work in NYC in a non-art position for $17+/hr. Love the office and people. Might not be able to get that job unless I firmly turn down the art job--might not get it then, anyway.**

Here's the situation. I have a four-year art degree for photography and graphic design and 30k in student loan debt. I live in NYC and currently work as a barista at Starbucks. I don't make enough money to pay my bills, and if I don't get a good job soon, I'll have to move, which I really don't want to do.

Last week, in a series of incredibly fortunate events, I met a woman who works as a pretty-high-up at a tech startup. I don't want to get too detailed, so that's all I am going to tell you about the company, besides the fact that they have a photo studio.

The woman I met (I'll call her Rachel) took an immediate liking to me, and I went to the NY office to do some freelance retouching. I got along amazingly with everyone else working there, I love the location, the vibe, etc. It's super-crowded because they're hiring new people before getting a new office, but it's bustling and exciting.

She said she wanted me to work with the company, full-time.  But the photo studio is in [location far away]. It's a two-hour commute one-way from my apartment, so four hours total. It's a 1.5-hour commute total to the NY office. So she wanted to see if there was a way I could do retouching from the NY office, maybe visiting the faraway office once or twice a week to do styling. We went to the faraway office together to meet the photo team.

The head of the photo studio is awesome. A couple of the photographers are much older guys, and they were friendly and welcoming. It's a small sector of the company, there are about 10 people working there (vs. the 50 or so I saw in NY). The girls? Yeah. Not so friendly. They weren't unkind, but they didn't make me feel welcome. They're all under 5 feet tall and adorable and stylish, while I'm 5' 5"", chubby and only own one cute outfit (clothes are expensive and I'm broke). They're overworked and underpaid and the morale there isn't very good, though the studio head is a great boss and does his best.

I went there, and in a completely unexpected move, they offered me a job.

Here's where the situation gets shitty. Rachel told me that if the NY office can't find a position for me, she'll hire me in her department. I'd be making 35k with hella sweet overtime. She thought I would be a good stylist for the photo studio, and I would, but the studio people, I believe, judged me for my outfit that day (I didn't know it was an interviewish situation so I dressed casually) and I was offered a retouching position--33k with no overtime.

Here's where it gets shittier. It's 4 hours total commuting, right? A monthly train pass will run me a gross $350/month. The photo studio regularly puts in more than 40 hours/week. Working from 8 to 6 or 7 is not unusual for them. With no overtime.

So I'm looking at waking up at 4:30/5:00 AM, leaving my apartment at 6AM and getting home at 8-9PM IF all my trains run on time, and come on, we know how that goes. So 8:30 at the earliest, I would say.

Let's do the math:  Working 50-57 hrs/wk (I'll average to 55), paying for my train pass, getting 33k, I'm looking at making, oh, 10/hr. That's about what I make at Starbucks, with tips.

Working in the NY office under Rachel, not doing anything relevant to my degree BUT having the opportunity to do any photo-related stuff they need, PLUS being in the same room as the creative department? 40 hrs/wk. 35k. Comes out to about $17. Yeah. That's a bit better. Did I mention overtime is almost $30/hr and there's usually a lot of it?

If I take the faraway job, I will barely be able to pay my bills and I will have quite literally NO free time. Once I take care of my cats, shower, do necessary things like grocery shopping, laundry, etc, I won't even have time for a good night's sleep during the week. I'll have weekends and that's it.

But am I a tool for even considering saying no to this? The store manager at my Starbucks has a GRADUATE art degree. Half the people I graduated with are in totally non-art-related jobs. This is a chance for me to get my foot in the door.

But it will also make me miserable. It will eat up all my time, and there are lots of people in the photo studio in line to be ""promoted"" before me. Retouching isn't even what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to work for an advertising agency as a photographer, designer, or creative director.

I need to give them my answer tomorrow. Help me, reddit. What do I do?

Edit: Forgot to mention that it's possible that because of in-office politics, Rachel might no longer be able to offer me the job in her dept because the photo studio will feel that she ""stole"" me. The two offices don't have a good relationship with each other. If I flat-out turn down this offer, there's a chance she can offer me the other position. However, if she can't, then I get no job at all.",AskReddit,"I'm an art school graduate, and I've been made a job offer to work in my field for a not unreasonable salary.

CaptainKernel,1323352086,/r/AskReddit/comments/n4t6g/weathered_nikon_f3_professional_camera_found_in/,"A friend of mine owns a 200 acre farm in the Yarra Valley area here in Australia. It's on the side of a mountain and is quite steep and rough in places. A few years back he was doing some clearing work on a back paddock and came across **[this Nikon F3 professional film camera](http://imgur.com/a/A5Iml)** partly buried in some vegetation. The camera is equipped with a motor drive but had no lens. He has now passed it on to me to see if I can find anything out about it as he hasn't had any success through the channels he's tried over the years.

This model is, from what I have seen, considered by some to be one of the finest manual-focus cameras ever made so probably cost a fair chunk of money when it was purchased. It was used extensively by pro photographers but was also popular with those non-professionals who were able to afford them. Putting it another way, it's the sort of thing that probably caused some fairly ripe language to be issued forth when it was found missing :-0. While it's now useless, if I could trace the owner or their family they may like it (and the film if it's recoverable) back anyhow.

Since it was found with the plastic lens mounting cover on and no lens I would hazard a guess - given the area is very rough with lots of wombat burrows - that it bounced off the back of a vehicle and was not missed until it was too late to work out where it went. The area has some pretty nice views from the higher points, and this paddock was right at the top of the farm, so I wouldn't be surprised if the camera's owner was up there taking landscape photos.

We have no idea how long it's been there, but I would suspect it's quite some time. It is corroded enough that every external movable part is frozen. I am able to lift the mirror and underneath that the shutter itself looks in decent condition. I suspect there is film in the camera as the indicator dial shows just under 20 shots taken. 

It has a surname (with no initials) on it (I've not included this in the photos or in this post due to it being personal information). There are enough folks with that surname that I haven't been able to identify anyone who is a good enough candidate to justify cold-calling and asking ""did you lose an expensive camera?"" :-/.

I guess one approach is to try and get the film out to see what condition it's in (and possibly develop it to see if that gives clues to the rough date it was lost or who the owner is) but I don't know how best to proceed since, as I mentioned, everything seems locked solid and I don't want to risk exposing the film to light. The motor drive is of course useless and, even if the manual rewind would work, I don't know if it's possible to operate that mechanism with the motor drive still mounted (needless to say the mounting knob for this is frozen too).

For those out there who have experience with the F3, just how rugged is this beast? It has been through a decent number of freeze/thaw cycles since that area gets snow in the winter. I've read that the interior seals were apparently very good, with film able to survive severe damage to the camera and still be able to be developed. If it's as good as they say, it's possible the film hasn't been contaminated (whether or not it's still able to be developed after this time is another question of course).

I guess another option, if the rewind mechanism can't be freed up, is to force the back open in a darkroom or changing bag.

Any advice how best to proceed to get this open? What's a good means of freeing up the mechanism?

I would suspect that if I do manage to get the film out, it ought to be handled by someone with skill in developing film by hand (I'm in Melbourne so it should not be hard to find someone). I'm not keen on the idea of taking it to one of those instant photo places.

Also, I'll mention I'm aware of the thread about 20 years ago (reddit time) from a guy who found a roll of film behind a toilet but never updated. This is my normal account and I *will* update with the outcome.

NB It just has occurred to me that if I could get the battery cover for the motor drive open, the batteries might have an expiry date on them which would give an idea of how long ago it was lost. This might be the first thing to try.

EDIT: tl;dr sorry for the wall of text: friend found an expensive pro-quality film camera in a back paddock of his farm. We suspect it was lying there for at least a decade, and probably longer. The moving parts (including latch) are all frozen up solid but there is film in it and I'm wondering if it's recoverable. Not overly important but an interesting little mystery (especially as to how it got there).

EDIT2: I decided to try forcing the battery compartment open to see if I could date it via the batteries. I was a little surprised to find that [it was empty](http://imgur.com/a/A5Iml#5).

EDIT3: Application of penetrating oil has started loosening things up a bit. I'm taking up [budbuds offer](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n4t6g/weathered_nikon_f3_professional_camera_found_in/c36fvwa) to open it at his photography school as they have the facilities to handle this.

**Background**
I'll be marrying my fiance in July of 2010, assuming the plans are still on.  I'm 100% into this idea.  By the wedding, I'll be 26 and she'll be 25 and we'll be together for four and a half years, living together for three years.  We recently bought a house (technically it's in my name, but we think of it as ours).  I've got a pretty decent job as a technical support analyst for a software company, and I'll be a pretty good provider.  She is a manager at the restaurant my mother and sister own and operate.  This is one hell of a sweet setup.  It's not like we're two crazy star crossed kids straight out of high school.

**Her Problem With Me**
Until recently, she was definitely happy in this relationship.  But out of nowhere, she's been really irritable.  She tells me that she feels like she doesn't have a voice and that I make all the decisions.  Last week, this discussion resulted in her taking her ring off, which is a theme we haven't really recovered from.  Since then, she's unsure about the marriage.  She contends I make a lot of important decisions without consulting her.  Examples: I bought Christmas presents for two of my friends and she thought they were too expensive (we're talking 40 bucks each)...one of them bought me camera last year that had to be around $90-$140 I'm guessing.  At work I arranged to roll five vacation days from this year into next year for the honeymoon without discussing it first with her ( ? ).  I'm letting my beard get a little long for winter.  I think my winter coat is fine and I don't want a new one, so she feels like I'm ignoring her when she brings up her contention that I should get a new one.  Most of this stuff is probably pretty petty, but since there's a lot of petty things, she views it as a large issue, which I do understand.

**My Efforts To Solve The Problem**
In the last week, I've been doing everything I can to make sure she knows she has a voice.  I've been consulting her about daily decisions: What do you want to do for dinner (previously I would just cook something for us both, otherwise we'd be forced to snack on crackers at 9pm), When do you want me to pick you up from the bar (previously I would mention that 1 am would be great for me), What movie do you want to watch (she chose Chicago...do you really think I would have watched a musical voluntarily prior to all of this?  Interestingly enough, I actually enjoyed it).  Aside from these examples, there's the wedding plans.  She chose her bridesmaids dresses, so I always thought I was going to be picking out the tuxes with my buddies, but she wants me to go with her instead so that she can weigh in.  I had always thought that was unfair, but it looks like she cares more than I do, so in the interest of picking my battles, I've since let that one go.  She wants cupcakes, I want a real cake.  Again, this seems more important to her than me, so I've let that go as well.  She likes cats, I like dogs, I finally got her a cat for her birthday.  These are just a few examples, but you get the idea.

The point is, I've been spending the last week doing everything I can to address her concerns that she mentioned about us last weekend.  Well, last night, she made it abundantly clear that she hasn't noticed any improvement whatsoever.

**My question to AskReddit**
That brings me to AskReddit.  Great minds of the Internet, help a brother out.  The problem is I'm doing everything I can in order to show her that I do care and that she does have a voice in all of this, but she doesn't see it.  

The thing that really scares me is that she's telling me she has a serious problem, and it can be solved with solution X.  When I perform X, it's as if I may as well have made no changes at all.

My question is: *What am I supposed to do--is she permanently incapable of recognizing my efforts or is she just temporarily blinded by cold feet?*  If it's the latter, then I can just wait it out and everything will be fine.  But if it's the former, then there's nothing I can do.  Anytime she ever has a problem from here on out, I'll be unable to solve it.  It's like trying to change your spark plugs but someone's changed all your tools into Jello and Twinkies.  You can't fix anything if your tools are ineffective.

Of course, I could just wait and see, but a divorce later is going to be harder to deal with than a break up now.  As a reminder, I completely want to marry this girl, so it's not like I can (at this stage) cut my losses and run.  My concern is that I'll never be able to help her with what ever bothers her in the future because she can't see when I'm trying to effect a change for her.

I'd ask 4chan what to do but I'm pretty sure they'd tell me to marry the cat instead.

**Edit: Conclusion** So we started talking last night.  She ended up reading about 70% of this thread.  Long story short, Reddit is way better than 4chan.  One of us is not as nice as all of us.

joiemoie,1582446226,/r/college/comments/f86t46/why_you_probably_shouldnt_double_major_discussion/," [Why You (Probably) Shouldn't Double Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSUZwLtFYWE)

&amp;#x200B;

I know this will be a controversial topic, so all respectful and free discussion is welcome. These are my opinions as a college graduate myself. I am also biased because I didn't double major although I considered it. I'd appreciate hearing counterarguments from those who double majored and enjoyed it.

Note: This refers to double majors where the extra major MANY extra classes. I am not referring to combined majors that actually take about the same time as one degree.  

The decision to double major can seem tempting. It lets people pick 2 loves for studies when they can't pick one. Some people are overachievers and just want to double major for the thrill and challenge. Some people want to double major because they believe it will raise their income and make them more well rounded. 

When I first entered college, I knew that I wanted to do engineering. I loved math and science, and it was the right fit for me. However, coming into college, I also enjoyed the humanities. I felt like I just wanted to be able to take on the challenge and be able to say that I was able to beat it. Because of this competitive mindset, I considered pursuing a double major when I entered college. In fact, I even thought to myself, I have enough credits. Why not pursue a triple major!  

**The first reason that you shouldn’t double major is because of cost.** Pursuing a double major basically means going after two degrees. Depending on the level of overlap, you could be looking at an additional 1 or even 2 years just to be able to finish both degrees. The cost of pursuing that second degree can basically be computed as the cost of tuition plus the time opportunity cost of having to stay in school longer and not being able to make money from a real job. If the cost of tuition is 30k per year, and you could have made 70k from a job with a single degree, then you basically lost out on 100k for one single year, and 200k for being in school for 2 years.  According to a study by PBS, double majors barely add any extra income. If you look at STEM majors who take an extra degree in the humanities, they earn **on average an extra 3.6% more income** compared to their STEM only counterparts. That’s basically nothing. When I thought about triple majoring, and finishing in 4.5 years, I realized I could just as easily do a single major, finish in only 2 years, and not have to deal with 4.5 years of stress and pain. Basically, that decision saved me 100k in tuition ALONE. This doesn’t include the savings because I was able to start working earlier, as well as the cost of food and housing when you are at school. 

So let’s answer the next question of whether a double major is truly enjoyable. The short and simple answer is no. **People who choose the route of double majoring usually really regret their decision because the courseload is too much if they really want to be able to graduate on time.** One of my friends who is double majoring rarely has any free time and literally spends all of her time just on her coursework. The only reason that she sticks with it is because she’s an international student, so staying in school longer buys her more time to find a job while she is still in school. My other friend picked a double major as well. After she realized it would take her 6 years to graduate instead of 4, she decided that she will cancel the double major. However, it’s not an easy decision. **Once you are already deep in the rabbit hole of pursuing your double major, it feels like a sunk cost to quit now. That’s why many people, even after deciding a double major isn’t for them, stick it through to the end.**  

**The real value of a single major comes from the fact that you can have laser focus. Having a major that you really like, focusing all your time and attention to it, and getting the best value out of that one degree.**  

**The first alternative is one major and one minor.** Usually a minor is just a few classes and very easy to complete. It doesn’t add much time to your degree, and you usually decide on what minor you want later.  

**The second alternative that I think is acceptable is one major and one master’s degree.** Truth is that you can literally do a master’s in anything irrespective of your undergrad. My coworker at Amazon literally did Animal Studies for her Bachelor’s. Then, she did a 2 year Master’s degree in computer science. Now, after less than a year of working, she got an offer from Amazon and is making that big money. Also, you aren’t committing yourself to hell at the age of 18 right out of high school. Instead, you are opting to pursue the master’s degree in your junior or senior year of college, ideally after you’ve focused your career path and known exactly what you want to be studying.  So overall, save your money guys! Don’t take the double major! If they are unrelated majors, you will basically be wasting it anyways, and if they are related, you could just as easily do the master’s degree and finish in just the same amount of time with even a more valuable degree!

[deleted],1299009245,/r/AskReddit/comments/fv9a4/my_girlfriend_is_uneducated_and_lacking_direction/,"I didn't have time to completely write my post the first time, and got trashed pretty hard in the comments. I left some things out the first time and generally made myself sound like a dick. I added and edited some things so I'm resubmitting my post to start fresh.

So I met this girl through a friend, and we really hit it off, let's call her Megan.

Megan is pretty awesome, she is funny, sexy, caring, compassionate, and is overall a great girlfriend. I had food poisoning about two weekends ago and she took care of me the whole time while I was shaking, vomiting, feverish and getting close to going to the hospital.

Had she not been there for me I would have ended up going to the hospital. I was on my couch under a blanket because I had the chills so bad and she sat on the floor next to the couch the whole time and held my hand until I began falling asleep and then made me get up and get in bed where she kept an eye on me all night.

The other day I went to eat with some friends where she works and when she brought the bill there was a very sweet and awesome note written on the back of it.

All in all she's great, I've never had a girlfriend that cares about me like she does and goes out of her way to take care of me, and make me happy. She does all the little things I've always wanted in a girlfriend like little notes, or even caring enough to bring me something to drink when she runs into the gas station. She also always has her own money and I don't have to spend a lot of money on her nor does she expect me to.

On the other hand, here is what I don't like. Megan is not the smartest girl in the world. Any text she sends me, or note she leaves me is so blatantly rife with spelling errors that it blows my mind as to how someone could not know how to spell a certain word. She'll often stop me mid conversation and ask me what a word means.

She's also younger than me by a few years, and is on the tail end of finishing her GED due to getting in trouble in school and general life issues. She doesn't seem to have a lot of direction in life, has no idea what she wants to do, and won't even consider taking general education college courses until she can settle on a career. Her current job has no future for her either.

This really bothers me because I always wanted, and am used to dating women who have their own careers in mind, are independent, and have direction and drive in life. I'm very well off for my age (early twenties) with two vehicles, a house, and a motorcycle. I don't care how much money I have, I refuse to be the guy with the stay at home wife who has no education or career.

I've tried to get her into reading, and learning, but she refuses to do it and absolutely hates reading. I can't make her do something she doesn't want to do or better herself if shes not willing.

I also hate her parents even though they love me. Her mother is a raging alcoholic who is constantly cheating on her husband, and I can't stand to be around her mother period, even when she's not drinking sometimes. It's to the point where I won't go into her house anymore, and constantly turn down lunch or dinner invitations so I don't have to deal with her mom.

On top of that she's not very understanding of my love of video games. She views them as a complete waste of time, and gets very upset when I want to play them to unwind and relax. For example we were at a friends house the other night and she was hanging out with his wife since she hasn't seen her in awhile. Me and my friend decided we wanted to hop on XBox Live and play Black Ops for awhile, and we only played for about 30-45 minutes. This put her in a completely terrible mood for the rest of the night and greatly upset her.

At the end of the day I just feel like its not fair that I work 40-60 hours a week, and am in a relationship with someone who smokes way too much weed, and has no drive or direction in life. She won't even take gen ed college courses until she figures out what she wants to do. She also spends far more time than I do playing video games chasing down bags of weed from various people because its such a huge part of her life. I wish she didn't smoke daily because I feel like it dumbs her down and makes her unmotivated. I'm tree friendly but not on a daily basis.

She's also pretty clingy and if she had her way would spend every waking moment with me. She just doesn't understand that some evenings after a long day of work I want to sit around in my boxers and play video games on my myriad of expensive electronics that I've worked my ass off for.

I like her, but I don't think I could ever love her, but I don't know, maybe with time it could happen. Am I just being a picky asshole who needs to shut the hell up or what?

tl;dr My girlfriend is uneducated and we are at very difference places in our lives.

I also posted this in /r/advice, but was hoping to get more replies.  I hope it's okay that I post it here.  If not, feel free to remove.

I desperately need your advice.

My family has been living without hot water or heat since August 2011. I live with my mom, dad, and younger brother (21). I'm 23 (f) and I'm at a loss as to what to do.

My parents rent our side of a 2 family house. I've lived here my whole life. The rent is expensive for what it is... My landlord raised the rent by hundreds of dollars a few years ago just because we got a used SUV. She's pretty much a slum lord and does illegal things. My parents are afraid of her and don't know their rights.

In MA, as I now understand it because of some links on rental laws that my boyfriend sent me, my landlord is responsible for providing us with heat and hot water. However, my parents are worried that my landlord will make them pay for some of it. She (illegally) made us pay half of the cost of a furnace when it broke in the middle of winter before, but they didn't know any better and didn't want to create conflict. They're terrified she'll evict us.

My dad keeps completely refuse to tell my landlord that we have no hot water or heat, for fear that she'll come in the house and see the condition it's in. He's worried she'll make us pay for it, which they can't afford. He's worried that she'll evict us, which she can't do, I don't think? I'm really confused as to what our rights our, but I don't think she'd be allowed to evict us. If she did, we don't have the money to move out, so I have no idea what we'd do, except maybe move in with my grandma. However, there isn't much space there. It's impossible to talk to my parents about this. Every time I do, they shut down. It's like they're children and put their hands over their ears and won't hear any of it. They want to ignore that we have any problems. They are not being adults. Every time I try to talk to my dad about talking to my landlord, he either passively says ""okay, I'll fix it"" until I shut up, or he'll completely blow up at me, screaming, and won't listen to me at all or be rational. He will usually then kick my mom out of their room and go to sleep, and then my family blames all our problems on me because I ""start fights.""

Our house is in bad shape in general. Our landlord has done the bare minimum to keep our house sound. She hired someone to replace the floor in our kitchen a few years back, for example, but now the tiles are crumbling because they were so cheap. We have a rug over it, but it's falling apart.

The ceiling in the kitchen underneath the toilet completely crumbled and collapsed with sewage all over the floor. My parents went months without replacing it.

Our walls are made of horsehair plaster, and there are multiple, large holes in my room because it's just crumbling. It's an old house. The wallpaper is beyond peeling off my walls and it's disgusting to live like this.

We live in filth... no one cleans up after themselves except my mom and me. My brother and dad leave their trash out and expect my mom to clean it up. It's disgusting.

My brother sleeps on the couch because there's too much junk in his room for him to live in it. Our porch is completely unusable for the same reason.

I have no drawers to put my clothes in because they broke. My parents keep saying that they'll replace them, but money apparently is an object, or something, because over 2 years later and they're still not fixed. I have my clothes in bags on the floor. However, it's gross, because moth larvae get into them. They crawl underneath all the clothes on my floor.

I have no room in my bedroom, partly because of this. I have a large amount of artwork and art supplies from when I went to art school for two years, that needs to be moved to the attic, but my dad will never help me move it there when I ask him.

So, reddit, how the hell can I improve my living situation???? It's a total drain to be stressing about all of this all the time. I don't know how I function with all of this on my mind.

I go to college full time. I don't have my driver's license and it's been hard affording driving lessons. I want to get a job, but as it is, it's my first semester back and I'm swamped with work all the time. Additionally, I'm saddled with around 70k of debt from going to art college for two years, previously. My aunt stopped cosigning my loans, so I had to leave and had no way of going back until my parents were able to cosign for me, 3 years later. I developed psychotic depression and have struggled functioning

I don't know what to do.

My therapist thinks I should move out and move into the dorms, but that would mean taking out additional loans. I can't afford any more debt.

We could move in with my grandma, but my mom has refused to talk to her about any of our problems.

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel so helpless.

Someone help me? Any advice? :(",AskReddit,no hot water or heat in my house for over a year - what can I do to help/ get through to my parents about fixing this? Long - lots of problems with our house ,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11tykr/no_hot_water_or_heat_in_my_house_for_over_a_year/,1350816345.0,school is too expensive,6.38
Known_Argument,1587083835,/r/college/comments/g2rhzx/really_stressed_and_torn_at_the_moment/,"   Whats up fellow college students. Im about to write something that might turn out to be really long so bear with me here. I'll try to keep it concise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the background info. So i'm wrapping up my first year of college at Nova Southeastern, a smaller school in South Florida. I'm in this program called Dual Admissions D.O, which is basically something that ""reserves"" you a spot in osteopathic medical school so long as you meet their gpa and mcat requirements. Nova's a private school, so even with about 25k per year in scholarships (including Bright Futures 100% scholarship) I still pay roughly 10-12k per semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the issue. I don't want to be a doctor, and I was pushed into this by my family. A common occurrence I know. However, the thing is my family knows about my disdain for medical professions. I'm a finance major and I have my real estate license. They're cool with all that, they just want me to get my medical degree for ""safety"" and then they say I can do whatever I want. Their reasoning is that if anything goes wrong in finance or real estate I won't lose everything because doctors always make a ton of money no matter what's happening in the economy, and if all else fails i can start a clinic or work at a hospital or something. The thing is, they're not necessarily wrong and I get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I took chem, my first required science class, in my first semester. And i was doing so badly I withdrew. The Dual Admit program requires an average science gpa of 3.5 or higher. If you don't do that you get academic probation and if by the end of the next semester you still don't have a 3.5 you get booted from the program. I'm currently taking chem and although i started off doing better, I did awful on my last test and i've fallen off track. I need an a minus (85%) to avoid academic probation. I've fallen to a 72%. I need to do well on the final to get anywhere near the 85, and it's not looking great. The coronavirus distraction didn't help at all. My dad at the moment is happy and proud of me, but he has no idea what's really going on. If i end up on academic probation i'll be in deep trouble. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing well in all my other classes, and I'd have a high gpa without chem. However I don't really care much about school, even the accounting and econ classes. I just do what I need to do to get the A without really trying to pay attention to the lectures. I spend all day watching videos and reading books about the real estate market, the stock market, and personal finance. I also attend all the virtual classes that my real estate company does. It's not that I don't like to learn. But something about being in class just makes me want to be anywhere else. I can't sit still. I still want to get my bachelors and i have NO plans to dropout whatsoever, but I don't want to get a finance degree from an expensive school like Nova when I couldve studied at UCF, stayed in my home city, and pursued a real estate career which I feel has at least some potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I have so many things on my mind at once that sometimes my brain can't decide what to do, shuts down, and i just end up doing nothing. I'm currently trying to work on my real estate business in the middle of a pandemic. I've got work in my accounting and econ classes that is really important to complete to keep my grades good, and then there's all this chem work and studying that needs to get done if i want to stay afloat. I have no idea what to focus on, everythings just in my face all at once. If the distraction of D.O. was gone, it would be a massive weight off my shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I would do if i could is transfer to UCF, in my hometown of Orlando. I could do my finance degree, won't have to worry about science classes that I have no drive to complete, and I could focus on building my future in real estate at the same time. Also bright futures would mean that I would pay nothing. In my senior year of high school UCF also offered me their most prestigious scholarship ON TOP of bright futures, since I was in the top ten percent of my high school class. I would be paying nothing for school, be close to home, and be able to focus on the projects that matter to ME. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really certain that doing that would make things so much easier for me. But my dad would be so angry at me for leaving the ""blessing"" of this ""guaranteed"" medical program, and he's already put thousands of dollars into this school. I would feel completely ungrateful and wasteful if i left. But that's a sunk cost fallacy, and I'm honestly not confident in my drive to complete chem 2, organic chem, physics, biochem, and then do ANOTHER 4 years of med school. But i just cringe so hard when i think of what might happen if i leave the ""safety"" of a medical degree to pursue real estate and finance. If things don't go as my mind envisions, I could end up struggling in life and my family could say ""I told you so"".

I also posted this in /r/advice, but was hoping to get more replies.  I hope it's okay that I post it here.  If not, feel free to remove.

I desperately need your advice.

My family has been living without hot water or heat since August 2011. I live with my mom, dad, and younger brother (21). I'm 23 (f) and I'm at a loss as to what to do.

My parents rent our side of a 2 family house. I've lived here my whole life. The rent is expensive for what it is... My landlord raised the rent by hundreds of dollars a few years ago just because we got a used SUV. She's pretty much a slum lord and does illegal things. My parents are afraid of her and don't know their rights.

[deleted],1337037875,/r/AskReddit/comments/tn9as/i_am_a_depressed_and_defeated_college_junior/,"Rewind to 2007, my senior year of high school.  Completely undecided with what I want to do for the rest of my life, I decide to apply to a couple schools (a technilogical university
and an engineering university) based solely on the fact that I did really well in math in high school.  Needless to say I did not take this decision, my future, very seriously.  This is reflected
by the fact that I was still undecided until I received my first acceptance letter (from the engineering university) and immediately decided that I was going to be an engineer, because I was
accepted to a top engineering university and engineers make good money.

 Fast forward a couple years,  debt piling up at an alarming rate from student loans, I am failing and dropping classes
left and right, barely passing those that I don't fail. I know I'm not the best student in the world, but I could pass all of these classes if I really wanted to, but with a complete lack of
interest in any of it and not giving as much of a shit as I should have it is becoming a real difficulty.  I receive a letter from the university telling me I am flunking out, I panic and write
a desperate letter to the appeals board and get approved to return to the university on severe academic probation.  I manage to pull my grades up enough to be removed from probation, but remain
completely and utterly depressed because of how I am spending money I don't have to take classes I don't want, debt still piling at an alarming rate. 

 It is now 2012, I have been at the same 
university for 5 years and am only a junior by credits because of how many classes I have failed/dropped, coupled with the fact that I haven't been enrolled full-time continuously since I 
enrolled (medical leave and a few part-time semesters).  One of the biggest reasons I have remained where I don't belong is because of pressure from my family (mostly my mom), telling me how 
great my future is going to be and how far I am going to go, discouraging me every time I come to them with my concerns about school (transferring to a different college for a different major, 
dropping out, joining the military) and egging me on to go the distance and how it will all be worth it in the end. 

 I've had a couple different co-op jobs with companies like General Motors, 
Bosch, etc.. and I've hated every single one, each one depressing/stressing me out to where I would get home from work, go to sleep, and not wake up until it was time to go to work the next day 
almost every night, not exactly something I am looking forward to if this is all that is going to become of my life after graduation, money be damned. 
While I no longer care what anybody thinks about my future or what I am doing in school, I am at a point where I feel as though I cannot drop out because of how much debt I am in (~$120,000) 
and I fear the only way I can ever pay it back is if I do stick it out and be miserable at a job I do not want simply because it will pay me enough to pay back all of my student loans, which 
honestly wouldn't really bother me either if my mother wasn't the cosigner on all of them, thus being stuck making the payments on tons of loans she can't afford if something were to happen to 
me or if I can't make the payments myself, and she doesn't deserve that. On a related note, however, I am afraid I will never be able to hold down a job good enough to pay it all back 
because of how much disdain I hold for my field of study and any relevant job it will help me land. 

 I apologize for how long this is and for all of the incoherent rambling, I have put no 
preparation into this and am blurting it out on a whim.  Fuck, reading through it makes me sound incredibly pathetic and I have nobody to blame but myself, but I don't know what to do without 
completely fucking over my future. So Reddit, how fucked am I (especially if I do drop out), and/or what are my options? Is there any realistic way out of this?
The only possible out I see (besides suicide, which isn't an
option because of the retarded amount of debt it would leave my mom with) to this is  to drop out and join the military, or possibly join the military while I am in school and stick it out simply to get a 
boost in rank when I am done and never have to look back at it.  I understand this is a jumbled mess, like I said I am just blurting it out, but I will do my best to try and answer any questions if it helps.

**TL;DR**: Been in school too long, retarded amounts of debt due to failing/dropping too many classes that I didn't care about because I'm in the wrong major, school I'm in only offers similar majors, family discouraged dropping out or seeking a new major somewhere else, resulting depression becoming overwhelming. Do I have any realistic/attainable way out of this?

[deleted],1339977295,/r/AskReddit/comments/v7678/my_older_sister_and_i_have_nothing_in_common_shes/,"I'm 20 years old (male) and she's 24. When we were kids up until about when I was 9, we got along fine. She did the normal older sister stuff, bossing me around, we fought, but at the same time, we were able to have a relationship. Probably because we were kids... Once she got into middle school, she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. Drug users, people who drank alcohol, and just... weird. Not to mention a lot older than her. I'm sorry but it's weird if someone in high school is hanging out with a kid in middle school. Since then, she got into loads of trouble, got shit for grades, always lying to my parents about every little thing, and it put a huge strain on the family and my parents marriage (I think). My mother is more free-spirited, so my mother and sister have always gotten along for the most part, but my dad was the one who was trying to put some sort of order into her life. Like any normal parent, he set curfews and RULES. My sister has just never been someone who did what she was told. 

And then there was me. I can't remember the last time my parents needed to tell me that I had to do my homework, clean my room, etc. I just always did what I knew I was supposed to do, and never got into any trouble. I got along with both of my parents and never really had any issues with them. 

What the hell went wrong here? Fast forward to about two years ago. She was 22 and myself, 18. My mother went to Florida for a week to visit her mom, and my dad was always working at the time. I haven't had a curfew since I was 17, went to a friends house, and get a call from my sister, screaming that I needed to be home. It was 2:30am, but I was watching a fucking movie at a friends house. Forgive me... I get home when the movie ended because let's be honest, I'm 18 years old, and I'm not going to let my degenerate 22y/o sister try to enforce a rule that she just made up for me, and she just... yells. Telling me I need to be home when I was told, blah blah blah. She calls my dad, who's at work and doesn't have the time to deal with petty crap like that, and tells him that I shoved her, and just started spewing more lies out of her mouth. I ask calmly to talk to him, she pushes me, I grab the phone from her hand and she proceeds to grab my hair, kick my balls, scratch my face and hit my kidneys. At that point, I was pissed, but I knew that if I hit her back, she'd call the police on me and come up with some elaborate story to get me arrested somehow. I finally get her off of me, and I just leave. 

I'm convinced that I was more mature than her 22 year old self, when I was 12... I'm in my third year of college, just got an amazing internship, doing well and have good prospects for my future. My sister dropped out of community college that my parents paid for, and now works as a hairdresser who can't make enough money to move out of the house. At this point, whenever I see her, I'm just irritated. She doesn't even wash her own dishes. I can think of a million other things I don't like about her, but it'd be pointless. My parents also bought her a horse and 2 cars. All of which had to be sold/junked because she couldn't afford to maintain them and neither could my parents anymore. She's a parasite. Because of the financial strain she put on my parents, I had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans just to go to school. I know I'll be able to pay them off, but I can't help but think how much better off my family would be if she wasn't around. It sounds terrible, but I have no reason to get along with her as you can see. Recently she tried blaming our lack of a relationship on ME. This was after she called me, again screaming, telling me that I needed to get home and go with her to a wake that my mom said she had to go to, or she was going to ""kick my ass"". I just hung up, because obviously, that had the opposite effect that she expected. Now we're just not on speaking terms, as usual.

My question is, what can be done about this? After texting her and convincing her that she was indeed wrong to threaten me, she still thinks that until I'm ready to have a relationship with her, we won't have one. At this point, why the hell would I want to have one with her? She's just so different from me, and we obviously cannot get along because of her control and perhaps jealousy issues. I really don't know. People keep telling me that we should try to have a relationship, but at the same time, why should we have to force something like that? I just can't. I choose my friends wisely so that I can keep drama out of my life and have done so successfully. But, I couldn't choose my sister, and she is the only source of drama in my life right now. It's toxic.

Magixal123,1599900436,/r/college/comments/ir9444/considering_dropping_out_advice/,"Hello,
This is a bit long so if you take the time to read this I seriously thank you. Just for context, I've been thinking about this for a while now. Its a shame because I'm very fortunate in having 100% of my college paid for. I dont pay for tuition, housing, books, none of it. I've earned enough in scholarships (most of these are smaller but they add up) and my dad is considered a 100% disabled veteran, which qualifies me for chapter 35 (basically a monthly check while i attend school) on top of my tuition being paid for by the military.

In all honesty I don't believe I was prepared to attend college. I went through high school like it was nothing. I never had to study because I just understood everything so easily. I graduated top 5% of my class never studying for any class outside of physics. I suppose, as egotistical as it sounds, this made me believe I was just smart and I assumed college wouldn't be that big of a step.

I tried to get in to a 4 year university of my choice, actually my dream school. I didnt even have to write the entry essay because of my SAT scores. I moved down to my dorm and classes began the next week. Im a computer science major, just realized I didnt mention that. First week of college was ridiculously easy. 2 of my classes didnt even have class because of covid, and the rest of them were online. My only assignment was to right a 100 word paragraph introducing myself (this took like a minute or two). 

The next week, I couldn't even keep up. I had to take trigonometry my first year, and during our first lecture I was keeping up with the professor just fine, understanding everything. Then he brought up cosine and sine and how they made relations to the arc of a circle, and he completely lost me. Everyone around me seemed to understand completely. Everything after that point in the lecture, everything went over my head. After the lecture I asked the processor if he could briefly cover that small section again with me, and he told me the lecture was recorded and is online if i need to rewatch it, asking me to leave the room, when I asked him where online I could find it, he just said ""On... Line..."" proceeding to close the door between us. So I went all over the processors website, clicking every link possible trying to figure out where the lecture was. And it wasnt there. Turns out he waited 2 days before even posting the video of the lecture. The audio was awful. I could barely hear the professor, and trying to actually understand what words he was saying was a different story. The video was also pointed at an empty wall, only making it harder to follow along. I picked up a textbook to try to keep up but at the pace I was catching up it seemed so hopeless. This is only one class. I have 4 other classes. I'd spent days, trying to figure out this first assignment, for one class.

This started negatively affecting my health. I found myself eating less. There have been times in the past weeks that i have gone 3 or 4 days without eating anything. As of now I'm maybe eating once a day, sometimes skipping a day. Depressed isnt a word I like to use, just because I feel like people will say I'm being dramatic, or theres people out there who have it worse, but I dont know what else to call it. I feel trapped. My girlfriend is getting worried for me assuming I'll do something regrettable. I cant drop out of college because I'll lose financial aid (obviously). If i lose financial aid I wont be able to afford my dorm. I have the option to break my lease if i drop out, but id be required to pay for the next 3 months of rent even though I'm not staying there. I've considered just not showing up for college and working full time but excessive absences could lead to an ""unofficial withdrawl"".

I know the ""right answer"" is to suck it up, study my life away, and magically become successful in all my classes. This is a big decision, and I wont ever have an opportunity again to have college all expenses covered. I feel like my past few weeks of struggling cost me a life time of success. If i fail even one of my classes this semester then my financial aid is revoked and right now im still 2 weeks behind in trig. In all honesty im afraid of what the world has in store for me. I dont know if I'll be able to provide for my girlfriend, and in the future if i have a family. Im considering other options, but it almost feels like my only options are somehow barely pass all my classes, or be forced to join the military (I am not saying the military is a bad option for those who choose to do it. But in my situation, I don't want to be sent away when theres people here who need me). I feel like dropping out of college would only make me a failure. I dont know what the odds of me actually being able to take care of myself are.

Please be 100% honest with any advice. I am not easily offended, and I'd prefer brute honesty over sugar coated lies. Thank you if you've made it this far.",college,Considering dropping out..

TheRapidTrailblazer,1603763323,/r/college/comments/jis9r6/not_really_sure_what_to_do_with_my_life_rn/,"I am currently going to a community college and my major is Science, A.S. The major is designed to transfer to a bunch of science/math courses at Universities. So far, I was originally going to major in chemistry, but after getting a difficult professor for Gen chem 1 and experiencing zoom community college with Gen chem 2 and organic chemistry 1 (even with a good professor) I became very certain that Chemistry would not be the subject I would major in, and decided to go along with Biology in the future. I looked at the University I was going to transfer to and I was looking forward to taking the upper level Bio courses even though some said they were really hard.

Now I am taking BIO 101 and 50% of the time I like it and 50% of the time its an annoying ass class with a lot of work. I can't tell if i'm disliking it because of its online-features (I don't pay attention to lectures I hate them), or maybe general biology just sucks and I haven't reached the good stuff yet, or its just not the right major for me. I'm not struggling in the class, I have an A. But now I am questioning whether I really wanna major in this subject. I am hoping that I am having a negative response due to covid tearing up the joys of learning. 

If I'm being true to myself, I am not that science-oriented. I love math and would like to major in that. Growing up my parents HIGHLY encouraged me to go to medical school and made it seems like it was the best job in the whole world and I would be making awesome money with prestige while helping sick people. Honestly I feel like medical school is blown out of proportion. Don't get me wrong and M.D is an awesome achievement and being a doctor can be rewarding but I just don't see it as something I was to slave away going to school for. I don't want to study for the MCAT, spend four years splitting my brain in half during medical school and spend 3-7 years of residency like school wasn't enough. And then watch my peers start their lives and have kids and enjoy being an adult out of school 

After making the decision that medical school is not the moves, I felt afraid that I was at an age where I pretty much had to know what I want to do in life so I can work towards that. I spent my entire life dreaming about medical school but I never even seriously considered other careers. I felt envious of my peers who had their whole lives researching and thinking of what they WANT do in life and how their parents gave them support 100%, they didn't feel pressured to choose a specific job or field.

Meanwhile I was deciding what I wanted to do in the future instead of medical school during my senior year of high school. I decided on pharmacist because even though they had to go to grad school, there was not much schooling after that and it was still healthcare so my parents wouldn't be really upset if I went against medical school. Honestly part of the reason why I choose pharmacy was because I was too scared to look at fields that wasn't healthcare. I wasn't able to take myself out of that comfort zone and really search what I want because I was afraid it was something my parents would want me to do. I think I want to do something math education related but my parents said I won't get a job with a math major and teachers don't get paid enough. LIKE FIRST OF ALL IM NOT TRYING TO BE RICH. I'm currently a math tutor at my community college and its really fun and fufilling. I like the feeling after helping a struggling student with a math problem even if it gets stressful at times. I have a sister who wants to have an art career and my parents were extremely against it and were completely unsupportive at first. She pretty much went through a mini crisis because other than art she doesn't really want to do anything else and my parents were really mad, my mom was especially livid and said things she shouldn't have said but she apologized later. Luckily for her they are supportive now and look for ways to help her

Studying drugs even looks really interesting (and it is!). So I got my pharmacy technician certification and I just got a job as a pharmacy tech after a year of job searching (Im a college student, scheduling is hard). I been working as a tech for a few weeks and I don't think being a pharmacist is for me because I been watching the ones at my job and it looks like the tasks they do are boring/difficult/and repetitive. Unless they are talking to a customer they pretty much stand in one place. At least as a technician its more of a stand/walk/crouch job. I was kinda split between being a pharmacologist (they make drugs) and being a pharmacist but I decided that being a pharmacologist is the moves for me for now. Another reason why I started leaning towards pharmacology was because the job market for pharmacists are a dumpster fire. It's not worth it to go into debt for school and have trouble finding a stable and decent paying job afterwards.

Anyways thank you for coming to my ted talk :) Hopefully its just covid school stressing me out",college,Not really sure what to do with my life rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jis9r6/not_really_sure_what_to_do_with_my_life_rn/,1603784923.0,can't pay for school,6.306666666666667
McCree_,1611125522,/r/college/comments/l13u3s/i_feel_i_dont_belong_where_i_am/," I am a master student at top 5 university, and I am studying applied math and statistics.

I have a rather long story about climbing up the the academic ladder. But now I am super unconfident in myself and never feel so doubt about myself.

When I was 16, I was kicked out of high school because I did something foolish. I was out of my friend's circle and had no one to talk to. And eventually everyone at my previous school hated on me because I was portraited as a ""bad one"" no student should hang out with, by the school community as well as some parents. So I had no place to go for one and half year. Even my parents gave up on me since we have 4 children in family, and my siblings were doing well. The days were so dark, and I became an underdog. On the edge of giving up on myself, I decided to go to a community college, because my last piece of conscience told me that it was never too late to start over again, despite what other people think about me and I was still young. Luckily it worked out, the community college accepted me and gave me the ""last chance"". I cherish the chance this time. I worked very hard and spend 3 times more work than my peers and I pulled ahead. I got straight A's in my math class (the only thing I am ""good"" at), and then I decided to major in math. Things got better and better eventually and professors started believing in my ability and wrote me letters of recommendations for me to transfer to a better college.

After 2 years of studying community college, I ""jumped"" into a top 40 university in pursing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics. This university was where I truly elevated my ability in doing math by spending 10+ hours every single day, including weekends and holidays. I believed that my hard work would pay off. I met lots of encouraging classmates as well as nice professors. I eventually forget that I was once an underdog, who everyone expected to lose at whatever I want to do. My life was getting better. After 2 years of studying in the university, I got my bachelors degree with an honor of GPA 3.947. I built my confidence by not getting a single grade below A- at the most high level math courses in my department. Also, I was so happy that I was able to get a graduate school offer from one of the nation's top 5 universities. I also had offers from other universities, which might not be that challenging, but I decided to shoot for the stars and took the challenge. I believed that since I made it here, I can make it again. I accepted the offer from the ""top 5"" university, but that was where all started to fall down...

I was expecting graduate level math to be hard but... It was not hard, it was INSANELY hard. All the brilliant minds in my department are those I just can't compete. They could finish some hard work (at least for me) fast, whereas I need 5 times more time to do. They could read notes easily and go into homework whereas I have to watch lecture videos again and again while searching all those materials online as I never seen them before. It turned out that most of them had already studied at their undergrad, or in some sense they built much better foundation then I did. They are smart, very smart. For my first quarter, I need to spent much time just to prepare for some ""pre-lecture"" material that professors don't even talk about in class, besides the fact that I have to spend even more hours on course materials. As for problem sets consists 6 questions, I needed help for 5 of them. When I ask a question in group, all other members knew the answer. It made me feel like I was so useless. I barely pulled off the first quarter with okay grades but here it comes the second quarter. Everything gets harder and harder where I don't even recognize the definitions in courses. Courses were so hard that I can't even manage time properly to get some sleep. The pace of courses were moving so fast that I cannot keep up with. Also plus the fact that 99% of my classmates got internships for the summer where I don't even have time because I need to study prerequisite for the following year. It seems they got all their futures planned out where I am the only one in the department that finds myself miserable. I think I am the worst person in everything in my department.

I am on the edge of giving up again. I have been thinking about dropping out many times throughout the week. I feel like I do not belong to a place like this, which was meant for mathematicians to be but not like an underdog like me. I think my department accepted me by accident. It might be true that I did some hard work and accomplished something for last few years. But in the end of the day, I am still the guy that was kicked out, who no college wanted to accept.

marynarasauce,1565645786,/r/college/comments/cpj0tb/clothing_essentials_for_college/,"A lot of talk is going on about dorm room essentials and tips for college but I think clothing is very important in how you present yourself, how you budget, and how you feel at college. And that is something we have yet to talk about much in this subreddit. So I wanted to make a list of some things that may be useful to get when you start college (I’m speaking for females but males may find some of this useful):

• cardigan/jean jacket (GAP, H&amp;amp;M, J Crew, Old Navy) - every girl should have at least one cardigan to keep in their backpack in case a class gets chilly. They’re good to throw onto a plain or striped shirt to complete a fall outfit. 

• tennis shoes (Nike, Adidas, Puma, New Balance) - try to invest in a good pair because it will make all the difference in how well you work out. Tennis shoes will go with any outfit and they’re super comfortable to walk in around campus. 

• sandals (Chacos, Birkenstock, Filas) - investing in a good pair of sandals go a long way. They’re the easiest to put on cause you can just slip them on and not have to worry about washing your socks. Your feet feel fresh and free and if they are a good pair, your feet won’t hurt. I have had cheap target sandals which look really cute but after a lot of walking my feet get blisters. 

• workout shorts (Nike, UnderArmour, Adidas) - so versatile and comfortable: they can be worn to bed, in class, and to the gym. Makes it so much easier to get dressed cause you can wear these with any t shirt and it’ll go together perfectly. I recommend underarmour shorts because they have POCKETS. they’re just like Nike shorts but with large pockets for your phone and keys and the quality is still amazing. They’re cheaper too! Only $18 for a pair on Amazon. 

• basic tees (UNIQLO, Target, Hanes, Amazon) - always a go-to for a chill day of class and if you want to dress it up, throw on a necklace... if you are feeling cold, throw on a cardigan. I recommend getting neutral colors like white, tan, brown, and dark green.

• rain boots/umbrella/raincoat - I recommend getting a rain jacket from Charles River and I found a cheap pair of Chelsea rain boots on amazon for $15 and they are super durable and cute. And as for umbrellas I recommend those small ones that extend when you open it so that you can keep it in your backpack bottle holder when you’re not using it

• A nice hoodie with a pocket (Champion, Hanes, Nike) I swear that pocket will save you and that hoodie will be your favorite article of clothing to wear in class during the winter

• sweatpants (Nike, Adidas, Baleaf, Lululemon) - something you can wear at home or in your dorm to sleep and head to class without changing. Try to find some with pockets. I especially like those adidas track pants with the zippers on the *giant* pockets and down the ankle. They’re expensive for a college budget but trust me they’re worth it and last a long time. 

• flannel - works like a cardigan but a little more suitable for summer 

• lanyard - you can find these anywhere so find one that expresses you well and keep your keys and perhaps an ID holder on it.

• water bottle (s’well, hydroflask, contigo) - not really clothing but it’s something that you should remember to carry on you. Some of these brands have new member discounts and S’well has a student store that you can access with discounts. If you want a hydroflask, keep in mind that you should find the standard mouth sizes so that they can fit in your side pockets instead of those giant ones you have to lug around by hand. Swell has very cute designs but hydroflask only has basic colors... that doesn’t mean it can’t be fixed a little sticker magic though!

• cap - not really an essential but I feel like every college student should have a cap in case of football games or outdoor events that get sunny. It’s a good opportunity to get a collegiate cap and show your school spirit!

Now keep in mind this is not a packing list and just some ideas for clothing items that aren’t so obvious. Some of the brands I listed are just my personal preference and I know it may not be feasible for the average student budget but some things are worth the money. There are so many ways to get a cheaper price on these things too so I recommend to check their websites for student discounts and daily deals on certain things. [Link to a complete list of discounts you can get for just being a student](https://www.retailmenot.com/blog/college-student-discounts.html) this list includes Nike, Champion, ASOS, UnderArmour, etc. Another way to save money is to get your free trial of amazon student prime for 6 months (after that I believe it’s $7/month) and buying your clothes there. Some prices are cheaper there including underarmour shorts and everything will be shipped in one box most likely which will save the earth. Just learn to check for any deals and make sure you’re not getting a 3rd party manufactured item.

solstice006,1631499244,/r/college/comments/pn6baj/should_i_keep_going/,"Like a lot of people, I just started my first term after graduating high school. I'm going to a community College that my dad suggested I go to since it's close to my step mom's house and that I didn't have to drive far to get there if I lived there for most of the time, but I wouldn't get to see my mom very often at all because of this or have any of my stuff like my computer and game consoles.

All my friends are going to a different community College so I don't know anyone here, and i had to quickly learn to drive and get a license all through out the summer so I could actually drive there, but even now I can never drive alone because of the road I'm not used to and the sun shining right on my face and the road to where the scratched out lines are near impossible to see, and yeah I could just go in a straight line since that is what it really takes, but the lanes shift from right to left too so I'm all pit of options on what to do, and I would know since the first time I actually got out to drive by myself I got myself into a wreck and now im having to deal with getting insurance and adding a whole other layer to all of this, and everyone is getting stressed out and mad because of my mistakes and I'm always getting the short end of the stick everytime

Those last couple paragraphs don't have much to do with college in itself, but that's just some of the small stuff within all this that kind of contribute to this. I mentioned I'm going to a community college so it isn't a university or anything big at all (around the size of two houses maybe) I'm taking around 6 classes, one of which is online and for First Year students, which so far isn't really a hard class, but completely unnecessary and offers practically nothing for college overall. I'm soon to enter i believe my 4th week, and I'm just not getting the hang of anything at all.

I'm taking my basics like many people do, but other than the fact that this stuff is literally the same stuff I already did in high school, it's on a whole different level at the same time. I was always able to get my work done fairly easy in high school because I always did it in class or study hall, but we dont have that stuff in college, we just do our hour long lecture, get out and go to the next lecture, and go home to do the homework I got. 

The first week or 2 I was able to pay attention well to lectures and be able to write down notes, as well as do the homework for the most part, but now, I dont even know anymore, I can't get any motivation to do half of it, and I just see myself just staring at my assignment just wondering what I'm supposed to do, and none of these lectures are helping me learn anything. I can't focus on everything the professors talk about, I'm not the best listener nor am I exactly an auditory learner either, the stuff I should be writing notes on I completely miss, and there's no notes on the board or any PowerPoint to help me write enough notes on like I would always able to in high school.

I can't even make myself do what I have to do on most of this stuff, stuff that they already made me do before with the only difference being that they added a small extra step to it, with me just sitting and thinking what I'm even supposed to be doing and repeating what I just read or wrote, and I just don't understand what this is supposed to help me with my future and career. I can really only bother doing Algebra and some career class since I actually have some interest or better knowledge of it, even classes like history or philosophy which I though would be interesting are made very exhausting and tedious for some reason, and my parents say that I'm not trying hard enough to enjoy them, but why would I have chosen those classes to begin with if that wasn't my intent.

I've already gone on too long, I just don't see a point in going through the rest if I'm not learning anything valuable for my future or career, the only thing I would have on the line is my associates degree, and I'm on the line thinking how much it would benefit me because I've been told both sides that it will help me live or that i cam do without it. The time I spend in college is time I could spend getting some job experience, I've never had a job so I can't be expected to get a high paying job without at least working at a fast food chain or something similar, or I could learn something useful for an actual career like going to trade school or learning how to code perhaps. If I do decide to drop out, what should be my next step? And how can I continue if I don't? How do I make this decision after my parents and I spent my whole senior year planning this out?

wilZow,1531696108,/r/college/comments/8z5vww/i_am_ruining_my_potential_because_i_dont_even/,"Hey guys,

bit of a sad rant here because I feel embarassed to tell my friends or family and just want to tell someone.

I live in Germany where there are 3 school systems, Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium. The best is Gymnasium, you can only study at a University with a degree of a Gymnasium, the worst is Hauptschule. After the first 4 grades you advance to one of them depending on how smart/good in class you are. I always had really good grades so I advanced on to the Gymnasium. 

At around 7th grade computer games came into my life. I spent hours and hours playing Counterstrike and World of Warcraft and my grades were really suffering under it. I didn't study for any exam ever (like seriously I can't think of any exam except my A-Levels that I studied for), but thanks to my Mom I always went to class, so that and the fact that I am not dumb (probably also thanks to my parents) guaranteed me that I pass all my exams with okay grades, so that I was able to stay at the Gymnasium, I also never did homework which really pissed my teachers off. 

So all went fine, until 9th grade, my grades have gotten so bad that my teacher adviced me to leave the school and join a Realschule, at the time I was really fed up with the Gymnasium, I only stayed there up until this point because I didn't want to disappoint my parents. 

My parents are the two most wonderful people in my life, they never put me under pressure, they only wanted me to have all the choices later on in life, and that I could study at a University if I wanted to. My dad is a Doctor and my Mom a nurse, they are both extremely bright people. 

So my Mom accepted that Gymnasium was maybe not the right thing for me, but it was, I was just a lazy idiot that wanted to game all day. So I switched to a Realschule where the level of education is so much lower that I knew everything they taught since 2 years. I easily outdid everyone else in the class and got my degree with really good grades, which only supported my lazy gaming addiction.

I wanted to do my A-Levels though, so I swapped back to a Gymnasium and finished them..... with terrible grades. I hadn't learned anything and barely passed my A-Levels. The worst grade you can get is a 4,0. I had a 3,5 which puts me in the worst 5&amp;#37; in my state. 

Even though its a terrible grade it allows me to study at a University, so I am currently studying Economics at a University  no one wants to study at because its in East Germany, but thats okay, because College reputation is not that big of a deal in Germany, this was my chance to turn everything around, good grades could get me an awesome job with high pay.

Aaaaaaand I didn't turn my life around (of course), I am currently in my 4th semester and my grade average is at 3,0 (4,0 is the worst, different from America) I failed a lot of my classes multiple times, so those aren't even calculated in there. 

Now to the reason I write this post:

The rule at my Uni is, if you fail a class 3 times you have to quit your studies, and are not allowed to study the same subject ever again in Germany. Yesterday I wrote one of the exams for the third time, I actually studied for once (not enough but still), and I knew my stuff. I went into the exam feeling a bit nervous but still okay. I nailed the two first question and felt good, the third question was tricky and I spent a lot of time on it because it gave a lot of points, I managed the first part of it but was stuck at the second, I panicked and did something really dumb. I crossed through several tries of the second part and accidentially crossed through the first part which I already had solved. Now I panicked out of control, I couldn't get the question I already solved solved again and I panicked more and more, my heart was pounding at this point.

 I don't have the grade yet, but I might barely fail. I wrote my professor begging for points, but I don't know if that will help.

What do I do if I actually have to quit, I would have wasted 2 years of my life, and I couldn't study econ again, a subject that I actually like. It would break my heart to disappoint my parents, knowing that they will be very supportive makes it even worse. 

I am just unhappy with my life, every year I tell myself I will turn everything around, but I just don't, even though I have all the chances one can imagine. If I pass the exam I want to study super hard next semester, but will I actually or is it just like all the other times?

I want to turn my life around, I stopped gaming 3 months ago completely, and haven't touched it since, but now I just piss off all my time on Netflix or Youtube. 

I just don't know what to do about the fact that I am lazy, overweight and generally without perspective.

bl1y,1567610501,/r/college/comments/czmar9/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_every_single_day/,"For those new to how academia is structured, adjunct professors are part-time, hired on a per-course basis, paid very little (I think national average is under $3k per 3-credit course), and are largely folks fresh out of grad school hoping to get a foot in the academic door. (Some others are older people with decades of experience teaching because they enjoy it, or as a form of semi-retirement.)

I used to have some hope that if I paid my dues, eventually I might be able to work my way into a term faculty position -- full time, but not tenure track. My department has basically closed the door to that. All new term faculty positions will conduct a national search for faculty, no preference is given to people already working there, and in fact having years of experience as an adjunct is a *negative* on your application. Since that happened, things that I used to let slide off have started piling up instead. It's fucking awful.

To start, the pay, god damn. I get paid less than 5% of the total sticker price of tuition for my students (their tuition just for the class, not the total each is paying for everything). I know lots of students get scholarships and stuff, but even if the average student was paying only *half* sticker price, I'd still be paid less than 10% of the total. Students might think they're paying for an education, but they money isn't going towards educating them, it's going towards creating a new vice-deanling of setting money on fire.

A ton of us got our hours cut this year. The norm was to teach a 2/1 schedule, meaning 2 courses in the fall and 1 in the spring, or a 1/2. The university caps us at 3 total. But, this year my department hired a *ton* of its own fresh graduates as adjuncts meaning there's not enough classes to go around and most of us just get 1/1.

I can't get our administrative assistant to answer a god damn e-mail and have to track them down in person, which isn't feasible when I have class starting *before* the department office even opens, and then office hours following that. When I do finally get a response I get repeatedly lied to. Just one small example, I got told by e-mail that dry erase markers are well-stocked in the supply room. Just plain false, they're under lock and key in the department office and have been for years. Last year we had to sign them out. 50 cent markers.

Our ""office"" space is a fucking joke. I'm in a windowless basement cubicle farm with ancient computers and busted up furniture and have to time-share my space with 3 other people and then get moved to another cubicle every semester.

This semester I needed IT support with both my ID card not logging in to the printers and my computer not even being connected to the printers. But, when you teach a morning class, IT doesn't even arrive until an hour after I'm done teaching.

They used to have locks on the paper trays in the cube farm for god knows what reason. And guess what happens if you need to refill a printer tray before the admin office opens? Rekt. The only reason there aren't locks on any more is because someone forgot to lock them back and I just fucking hid the locks behind the printer.

Despite massive expansion on campus (we just got 3 big new buildings) we're still somehow over-crowded and classes are now being held in an auxillary building. It's not super far, but it is about a 15 minute walk from the rest of campus. A lot of faculty and students complained, asking to have classes moved back to the main campus, so what does the administration do? It sends out an e-mail clarifying that this building is part of the ""main campus."" Not ""we're sorry for the inconvenience but we're doing the best we can,"" nope. Just ""fuck you for complaining, now watch as I lie to your face about it."" I replied to the e-mail with a link to the campus map which clearly distinguishes the building from what the map calls ""main campus.""

We have an adjunct professional development fund that amounts to a whopping $50 per faculty member to help pay for things like travel to conferences. It's only enough so that about 50 out of 650 adjuncts can get the full amount available. And it's first-come, first-serve, so fuck you if your conferences are in the spring.

There's a $17,000 projector in my classroom that I don't get to use because the university won't provide me with a $150 tablet. Their response was that if I want to use it I need to bring in my own personal laptop. You know what happens if my laptop gets damaged from the wear and tear of traveling back and forth to campus? I'm homeless.

And I know someone's going to be thinking ""you should unionize""... we are unionized, and the union sucks! The last two contracts they've only managed to negotiate wage increases to match inflation. The board of trustees allocates money for our pay way before negotiating begins, then their lawyer shows up and just says they can't give us any more and the union's been taking it for years.

One last thing, paying adjuncts more would *not* cause tuition to go up. Tuition isn't based on how much the university needs, it's based on how much the university can squeeze out of you.

curbnola,1529335527,/r/socialwork/comments/8s0d61/ive_been_thrown_into_a_situation_im_completely/,"I don't mean this in the way that working a regular 9-5 sucks but is manageable, I mean that the job I'm working at until August is so genuinely depressing that I need advice on what to do.

I'm a 21 year old male (rising senior) working at an NGO in Athens that helps unaccompanied refugee boys with social services and legal aid. These kids have been through absolute hell, and seeing them try to make sense of the shitty hand they've been dealt is way beyond anything I can handle right now. I help the lawyers that they have on staff and do some fundraising/clerical stuff, but my main job is teaching English and working at the study/drop-in center so I interact with the boys a lot.

The stories I've been privy to and the way that these kids have dealt with it is both deeply saddening and incredibly inspiring. These kids are in a country that's hostile to their mere presence most of the time (I'm not blaming Greeks at all, but fuck the EU for their handling of this) and are deeply traumatized. Most of the kids really try to make a connection with the staff, but they're very emotionally guarded and don't know what to do about it. One moment they'll be fine and just acting like kids and the next they'll lash out at one another and start fighting. I have two brothers, so I know that boys fight and it's not a big deal, but the look in their eyes is just fearful and deeply angry. I used to be homeless, so I understand the deep sense of insecurity of not knowing where you're going to sleep or how you're gonna get by. But I had my mom and brothers to lean on, and these kids are just on their own. Some of the boys (they're all under 16) have had to resort to drug dealing or even prostitution just to be able to scrape by while living in squats or parks, and it absolutely breaks my heart to see. A lot of the kids are depressed and many self harm (visible scars on their wrists).

And while the staff are all great people and genuinely want what's best for the kids, sometimes they get overwhelmed and lash out at the kids. For example my boss absolutely berated a young Afghan boy for messing up a lacquer job on a table (the NGO is partnering with a well-known US research university to do technical workshops) to the point where I had to step in and tell him to chill, and the kid didn't even react. He just shut down, and it made me so incredibly sad. This kid is 13 and did carpentry in Turkey just to get here, fuck off with shaming him for slightly messing up lacquering a table when he's never done it before. Like what are these kids gonna do? That profound sense of uncertainty about your own future is pernicious and toxic.

It's just incredibly jarring to be talking to a kid (mostly in a pidgin language of Farsi, English, and Greek) normally and have him drop an incredibly traumatic detail. Last Wednesday I was doing a private English lesson with an 11 year old Kurdish boy from Syria and we were talking about soccer, and he asked me if I were any good. I told him I liked to watch, but I'm better at other sports and told him about the time tore a ligament in my ankle playing soccer. He chuckled at the thought of that and then told me about the time he stepped on a landmine when he was 7 years old and how he can barely see now because of it. This kind of shit is so common when you talk to these kids, and we're just collectively so absolutely cold and uncaring in response. It's an incredible societal numbness that I can't even begin to understand. They're just kids, but their childhood has been robbed from them and they don't know anything else. I'm also living in one of the big immigrant neighborhoods here, and it's disgraceful to see the way that needy people who are absolutely capable of making a contribution are being absolutely left behind.

I understand their situation on a very limited level because when I was in high school me, my mom, and my two brothers were homeless for a little while and I can remember just how helpless I felt. We had to steal from grocery stores and sneak out of dingy motels when we couldn't pay, but somehow I got into a good college that's funding this whole summer for me. Believe me I don't take any of this for granted, but it shouldn't take a stroke of blind luck to make sure that kids have the opportunity for a decent life. This whole thing just makes me feel so helpless and hopeless because a lot of these kids remind me of myself when I was their age, and it's so sad to look into their guarded and leery eyes and reassure them when I have no idea what's gonna happen.

You can see from this post that I'm getting very cynical, and my thinking is maybe a little too emotional. What can I do about that? How can I cope with this job? I can't quit because I would feel so incredibly guilty about leaving these kids behind just because I'm uncomfortable.

TLDR: My summer internship is very depressing, and I don't really know how to cope.

I have been in college for a little over 3 years and have fluctuated between majors because I have no freaking idea what I want to do with my life.

I went into college wanting to become an art teacher but taking the actual art classes felt like such a joke to me and started I make me hate art. 

After that, I was uncertain of what I wanted because I had always thought of being an art teacher my whole life or at least doing something with art. 

I hate not having any direction. My mom suggested I go for accounting because I like math and would make good money. I enrolled into the ""basic"" math class and really struggled all throughout the semester. The professor had a thick accent and was throwing too much at us, at once. I barely passed that class and just couldn't see me pursuing accounting when barely getting by in basic math. I did also take business ethics that same semester and learned I really enjoyed it. 

After this mess, I had a breakdown in front of my boyfriend. He suggested I go for graphic design because it would still be something I was passionate about. I had to get on the wait list for the class because I came to my decision a week before classes started and it's only offered one semester. This class determines whether or not you get accepted into the program and only 20 of 40 students are chosen. I think I made a weird impression on the instructors by enrolling so late and had an awkward encounter by showing up to their office and asking how I could get into the class.... I eventually got in the preliminary class. As for the projects, I think I did really well on them. The grade to quality ratio always felt off though. I would put so much time, work and energy into these projects and the grades would just be so upsetting and I wouldn't understand. I can say my projects were good and really pushing my creativity and have even gotten positive feedback in critiques saying so. I really felt these professors had it out for me for some reason. Idk why because I kept to myself and never like asking for their help. Anytime I did, I could always see the annoyance on their face and one of them kind of caught an attitude with me if I asked a question and didn't know about how to do something (they said they don't expect you to know anything) 

there was this one occurrence in particular where everyone had to have the moody instructor bind your book project together. She said it was my turn to go but this girl walked over to her and took my spot, as I was getting up... when it was my turn, she asked me if I would pick up all the excess paper on the ground and throw it away. This really bothered me for some reason and felt somewhat demeaning. 

The book project was a big determining factor of if you got into the program or not. When you get your grade, you see what the class as a whole got, anonymously, and I was in the top 20, which made me think I could get into this program. I didn't get in and now I'm back to square one. I can either, wait an entire year, not being able to take any classes, and apply for the program AGAIN, with no guarantee of getting in, transfer to another school, or change majors.

I really enjoyed the graphic design class but don't feel it was ethical. I feel they had favorite students from the get go. I was surprised I wasn't accepted because this was the first time I felt so sure of a career path. I really don't want to transfer because I am just so tired of school and at this point I just want to have any degree. I'm also just scared to have to start all over at another school. It's private and would be a lot smaller and expensive. The drive is also a bit more inconvenient than what I have now. I also just like keeping to myself and don't like an instructor all up my ass. I also don't want to feel forced to make friends in all my classes because they're small and it would just be weird to not have a friend. I just wanted to be in the design program at the school I'm in. I could possibly appeal it but don't know how to go about it and the instructors would only hate me more.

My mom suggested business because it's reliable and that I just need to get A degree because most employers hire degree holders and I just need to be able to make a good living no matter what job. I enjoyed business ethics. 

Someone please give me some words of wisdom. I'm at an all time low. It's devastating that something you've done your whole life and have been told you're good at (art), gets rejected. 

Tl;dr: didn't get accepted into the graphic design program at my school when I really thought I would. My options are to reapply after a whole year of not taking any classes and having no guarantee of getting into the program, transferring to a private school with the program (don't want to transfer really), or change my major for the fourth time.

overwhelmed-student,1557288021,/r/college/comments/bm0ndd/i_was_planning_on_transferring_and_recieved_a_c/,"Sorry if this is a detailed post, but I'm genuinely floored on what to do here.



I had completed 2 semesters of college at a 4 year university before this, with a 3.76 GPA, honors college, etc. Even though I have autism, ptsd, GAD, amd ADHD, I got on meds, therapy, worked hard over breaks to learn what I wasn't taught in high school (like higher math) and have generally just been busting my ass for school.



I had attempted Calculus 2 for science and engineering majors once, the summer after my first semester. I withdrew due to a death in my family. I was told at my 4 year by advisors in my department (Computer Science) at our orientation to take Calc II at the local community college, they even readied the forms for us to enroll there immediately. My school publishes grade distributions, and hardly 40% pass calc 2 at my school. Naturally, I signed up at the community college.



I had no idea how disasterous the course would be. My professor was really disorganized, had never taught there before, and was very very strict on grading ( minus 5 if you forget + C, or write u before you plug in the original value for the integral and evaluate) I saw many classmates struggle, but I think some of them did well despite no curve. I got 60's and 70's on homework regardless of utilizing tutoring, having my answers checked by the tutors, etc. I could do the problems, but would make a minor mistake and lose 10 points.



I went to office hours almost daily, and was the only one who ever attended, I was very friendly and close with the professor. I really did try my best. I just couldn't perform to the professor's expectations. Now, I have a dilema. I cannot attend my 4 year school anymore, because it is too expensive, I don't get enough fin aid. They also don't have my intended major, Neuroscience, or any courses in it. I want to double major in Neuro and CS.



I sent out several transfer applications, but I know even if I am accepted, I will likely be rescinded because I got a C. Calc II is a pre-req for a few of the CS, Neuro, or Computational Neuroscience programs that I applied to. My cummulative GPA has now dropped to a 3.56, because I wasn't taking many credits, and got a B in another course (which I am grateful for, because most of my class failed, I will gladly take the B!)



I started crying earlier, because it feels like my one bad experience in a class will screw me over. I am going to have to attend this same community college due to costs, and my GPA there is now a 3.0, meaning I may not have access to the honors or research courses that I was planning for fall, and have seriously blown my shot at many of the univerisites I was interested in. They do not allow grade forgiveness unless the course was taken over 5 years ago, and their policy is that I cannot take the course again because I have now taken it twice, they will include the W. I did pretty well in Calc 1, I had a B and was close to an A for most of the semester, struggled with related rates and that one bad grade brought me down. I have gotten perfect grades in Statistics and Computer Science as well up until this point.




My transfer goal for next year was GA Tech or USC. I know admission for CS majors is higher for women at some schools, but I don't really put faith in that. I feel like I can do well in Calc 3, but I'm not sure if that will make up for this blunder. I have a 32 on the ACT, 33 superscore, and a ton of extracurricular activities and awards.



I've done research in high school and college, won two science fairs, presented my college research in AI and ML to a huge tech company, my contributions were included in a paper that was submitted for publication, I've been on student council in HS and college, I won a high level state writing award, AP Scholar, been learning music for a year and had several concerts, a few hackathons (including at harvard) I founded a GSA in high school and was president, volunteered a ton in HS doing STEM community service like bioblitz, tutorting, lecturing on research, leadership position in Japanese speaker's club in college, worked since I was 16, currently work in technical support for my uni, and have an upcoming research internship at a national lab for CS.



I also have a very unconventional background because I grew up really poor and living on my grandparent's farm. I have been almost entirely self sufficient since 16, one of my parents died from drugs/alcohol when I was really small and the other is severely mentally ill. This is a perspective that I talk about a lot in my essays, and how it has motivated me to become a researcher, and never give up my pursuit of learning.



Even with my extracurriculars and circumstances, do you all think that a C is going to be the nail in the coffin for a Neuroscience program or double major program? Will this bar me from entering good graduate schools? I've been so upset about this, wishing that I could have prevented it even though I studed vigorously and grinded practice problems like no one's business.",college,"I was planning on transferring, and recieved a C in a course.

40dollarsharkblimp,1353753361,/r/AskReddit/comments/13pkt4/at_a_party_with_old_classmates_i_found_out_one_of/,"My friend has always been a troubled person. Terrible home life. Abusive dad, broken mother. Minor-ish drug problems. But when we were in high school, he still managed to take care of himself, get decent grades, and maintain a normal social life. He was and is smart as a whip; we attended one of the most prestigious college prep schools in the country (certainly the most prestigious in Los Angeles). 

But for some reason, when he went to university, he stopped caring. He smoked weed all day, every day, in his dorm instead of going to classes. He was asked to leave the school before the first semester even finished out.

Things got worse when he went back home. His home life deteriorated further, to the point where he was placed in a psych ward at UCLA following a fight in which he hospitalized his father with a serious concussion. His parents divorced soon after, and his father cut off contact with him completely. 

By this point, my friend was smoking so much pot that he could no longer support his habit with the modest allowance he was still, incredibly, receiving from his mother. He began to steal, first from his house and then from his job. He was fired. His mother put him into a rehab program. He was ejected from that as well, after being caught selling drugs to the other patients.

A few years ago, when this was happening, I attempted to step up and help my friend. I called him a few times a week to check up on him, told him he needed to quit smoking so much fucking weed, and called in some favors to get him another job. However, again and again, he fucked it up. Eventually, feeling used, I stopped checking in. I got fed up.

It's been a few years since then. I'm 21 and about to graduate college. I came home this week for thanksgiving break, and earlier tonight attended a party with some old high school classmates. One of them informed me that my friend is now homeless, living next to a gas station near his old house. His mother and the rest of his family have given up on him, and won't speak to him. 

I was heartbroken to hear this, but it didn't compare to how I felt once I tracked him down. I found him asleep, right where I was told he'd been living. He looked like a skeleton. I woke him up; he thought he was hallucinating, and it took him a few minutes to become convinced that I was, in fact, there in front of him. He hadn't eaten in four days. I went into the gas station and bought him about twenty dollars worth of food. He was crying when I handed it to him. I gave him my phone number and told him to get some rest and call me in the morning.

Reddit, what the fuck can I do? Where do I start? Nobody but me cares about this person. His family has left him for dead. He's a fucking kid like me, 21 years old, and at this rate he'll be a corpse within six months. He's in Los Angeles; in two days, I'll be flying back to my job and school in New York. What do I tell him tomorrow morning when he calls? How can I help? I don't want to get totally sucked into his problems, but goddammit if I'm going to stand by and let my friend die when I know I can do something for him.

**UPDATE:** Talked to him this morning. He called me on a phone that his mother is apparently still paying for (either she still cares about him at least somewhat or she cares so little that she hasn't bothered to cancel the contract). I told him how bad his situation looked from the outside, and he acknowledged that he thinks this is rock bottom. He has, unfortunately, been supporting himself as of late by selling weed for a local dealer who pays him in checks every two weeks. I told him to cut that shit off immediately, and to stop smoking right the fuck away (not from a health perspective, but from a what-the-fuck-you-can't-afford-that perspective). He is also already on food stamps, but he says they only give him about $200 every 62 days, which he spends right away on dumb, unhealthy meals like Shakey's and Burger King... 

As per the suggestions here, I called up the local Salvation Army and they assured me that they would help him if he came in. Hopefully he's there now. Unfortunately, I leave for NY in the morning, so I feel there's little more that I can do. I gave him a pep talk, my email address and contact info, and told him to send me his resume as soon as he can so that I can edit it for him and give him suggestions (he really needs that help; he was gonna put the last job that he stole from down as a referral). I also told him to tell me the second he was unable to get food, because I can get my parents/friends to help him there.

Is there anything more I can do? Any outreach programs I should know about? I'm so new to this kind of thing I feel like I'm pretty much stumbling in the dark. I don't even care if a successful life is beyond the kid at this point. I just want him to be happy, and alive.

I have been paying for my own college education since I graduated from high school.  My parents at that time were pretty well of on paper, however all of their money was tied up in investments which ended up causing them to go bankrupt.  I have gone to community college on and off for the past 6 years.  The last time that I went was over two years ago.  It's not for a lack of desire.  I want very badly to graduate from college and get a good job so that I can start a family of my own.  I currently have one year down on my transfer degree.  47 credits that I have spent years chipping away at.  The last time that I went I was finally eligible for some financial aid assistance, due to my parents bakruptcy.  I filled out my fafsa and got everything that I needed to in to the financial aid office.  They kept asking for more and more information which was very difficult to get.  I  had to track down information from my biological father, who keeps less than satisfactory tax records, and from my mother and stepfather.  They were going through a divorce, and getting tax information and their help with paperwork was like pulling teeth from an alligator.  I finally got all of the information that the financial aid office requested, and they said that I needed to petition my reinstatement of financial aid (or something along those lines) even though I had never received financial aid before that point.  It had something to do with the fact that it had been so long since I had gone to school.  Well I did that and the quarter started.  I was working a graveyard job which got off at four in the morning, and then going to school from 7:30 am to 11:30 am.  then I had another class three days a week at 7:30 pm.  It was hard, but I was willing to do anything to get my transfer degree.  The petition for financial aid was rejected, and I learned that I was not going to receive financial aid that quarter.  I stopped going to my classes.  I was only about a month into classes.  I deeply regret this decision.  I had assumed that, since I had not been in the classes very long, and since I had no way to pay for the classes that it was unnecessary to go to them.  You know what they say about assuming.   I ended up receiving failing grades in all of those classes, and still being liable for the tuition.  Please keep in mind that I was supporting myself, and lived on my own.  I have not received support from my parents since I was kicked out at 17.  I was focused on surviving as well as school, and when the financial aid was declined after I had already started, I had a lot of other things on my plate as well.  It was a dumb decision looking back, and I now just chalk it up to being young and stupid.  It is two years after that now.  I could not go to school during that time, because I was unable to pay for the previous tuition.  It eventually went into collections and I have spent the last few years working what jobs i could and keeping my head above water.  This last year and a half I have been working full time at a decent job with good hours.  I make more than minimum wage, and I am very thankful for that.  I have now paid off all of my debt,  including what I owed the school.  I am finally in a position where I am ready to go back to school.  On top of that, I turned 24 and am eligible for financial aid based on my own income, rather than my parent's.   I have signed up for classes fall quarter and gone through the entire financial aid process.  There is only one problem, I am not eligible for financial aid.  The tree failing grades that I received bring my gpa down to a 1.97.  I need a 2.0 in order to receive any government financial assistance.  I have no idea what my next move should be.  I do not want to take out student loans before I go to university if it can be helped, but I also can not afford the $1200 a quarter on my own.  Not to mention books and parking and the other things that come with going back to school.  Are there any options that I am missing?  Any advice that a redditor could give me that would help me to get through this?  If I can get through these next three quarters, I will have my transfer degree and I will finally be on to a university, where my major will be in computer science.  I plan on paying for university with student loans, there is no other way for me to accomplish that, but I do not want to bury myself in debt again, so soon after I dug myself out.  Any advice from someone who has gone through something similar, or advice on my current situation would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

[deleted],1326231519,/r/AskReddit/comments/obctl/i_was_sexually_assaulted_and_forced_to_withdraw/,"Hi Reddit, obviously a throwaway account hope you enjoy the name

I'm a 20 year old dude who was sexually assaulted in September of last year by another student. I'm not going to get into the details of what he did or exactly what happened, so please don't ask about that. I had no physical evidence so I could not go to the police. Instead, I went to my school's disciplinary dean and went the the formal complaint process. 


It was exhausting and frankly rather embarrassing, but everyone was very supportive and the disciplinary committee found in my favor and punished the other student. For quite a while after this, I was very much in denial about the effects of the assault on my psyche and ability to function. I continually told myself that I was fine and that everything was ok. I even told the deans the same thing.


I was not ok. I went into a spiral of depression (something I've struggled mildly with in the past and take an SNRI for now), stopped going to class, and really only left my room to eat and when friends would call or come over. Because I was in such denial about it, I continually told everyone in my life that I was fine, until one point in late October/early November when it all just kind of fell apart and I stopped even communicating with the dean. This is where things really come crashing down.


My classes were obviously a mess and the dean called me in and told me that I should voluntarily withdraw (she did not tell me the consequences at the time) and not to return after Thanksgiving. I also found out the dean had no idea that I had been sexually assaulted (which is standard protocol, they aren't going to tell people without my permission). When I told her, she almost shrugged it off. It was essentially crushing. I never was looking for sympathy, I just needed some understanding.  I had no idea what to do and told myself that the situation was recoverable (Which, to be fair, it was). Despite it being recoverable, depression is a bitch and I just couldn't do, well, anything. I came back to school after Thanksgiving, and continued as if everything was normal.


I had completely cut off contact with basically everyone except a few friends and my family at this point. The dean sent police to my room to find out what the hell was going on (not to arrest me or anything, just to find me), I continued to fall deeper and deeper into depression, things went to shit. She then called my parents (completely understandable) to get them in on this and get me out. I went to see her the day before I left to ask what my options were and it was very much a, ""quit or you're fired,"" situation, so I withdrew and left within 24 hours.


I needed to leave school but I also needed help, and no one seemed to realize what was going on. I want to be very clear that I do understand my role in this and that I absolutely should have told someone what is going on, but it was just crushing me. It's hard to explain what that single night did to me, but suffice it to say, it's been fucking awful. I should note that the earlier mention of the police coming to my room was not the first time they had come looking for me (for obvious reasons), but my parents were never let in on the scenario.


Which brings me to my current status. The school wants me to leave for an entire year before coming back. This is absolutely an untenable situation. It essentially removes the school as an option. I can't wait until 2016 to graduate, I graduated high school in fucking 2009. As far as my recovery goes, I'm not going to get better sitting on my ass at home lifeguarding all day (as great as lifeguarding is). To add insult to injury, the guy who did this to me appealed and had his suspension lessened. He will be returning at the same time I will. I don't know what to do, I feel like I've been punished for something that I had no control over. My life is in absolute shambles, I'm in therapy that's too expensive for my parents to afford, and now I don't know what the hell to do. I just want my life to be normal again. I know that I'm capable of going back to school and I'm more than willing to have my therapist attest to that. I want to make a change in my life and it's not going to happen at home. Do I have any options?


a few additional details:

 * it's a private school (but does receive federal funding like pretty much every school)

 * it's in MA

 * in spite of everything, I do love the school. It was my top choice and they gave great financial aid. The professors are excellent and I have great friends there. I don't want to leave if I have any possible chance to go back

 * everything sucks, but at least I'm not as depressed anymore

 * I'm not going to kill myself, that's a lot of effort for very little reward and I'm pretty lazy

tl;dr: ~~dm;hs~~ go back and read it jerk (please)

artechniq,1463242225,/r/college/comments/4jbzh0/seeing_friends_graduate_today_and_feeling/,"Hi I'm a 22 year old, confused college student. I don't know what I'll get out of making this text post but this has been beating me up for a while now and I guess I just feel like ranting about it.


My facebook and Instagram are flooding with the people I went to high school with graduating this week/today and I feel absolutely devastated that I'm not anywhere near that goal. I was a pretty good student in high school, graduated top 10 and I was part of the national honor society, I had big plans. 
I started going to the university of texas at el paso the same year I graduated and I was going for microbiology. I took classes with a friend who was doing the same thing so we took all our classes together. It didn't go very well and I became very depressed to a point where I had counseling. I wasn't sure this was what I wanted to do but it's what I felt I had to do since my parents always pushed me towards the medical field/medical school. A lot of people, including the school guidance counselor, encouraged me to study illustration or graphic design because of my ability to draw, but I never considered it an option because I felt it wouldn't get me a stable job. 


I got out of UTEP and I decided to go for ultrasound technician at a private school, my friend sticked to UTEP despite how bad it was going for her as well (shes one of the ones graduating today). I found out that to get into the ultrasound technician program I had to become a medical assistant first. So I did, I got a job after I was done as an MA in the mean time while I got into the ultrasound program. Never happened because I began to have family issues and I ended up becoming the one my family depends on money-wise. I can't exactly stop working to go to school full time. I decided that that school was a waste of time and money since they make it so hard to get into any of the imaging programs, so I found out about the ultrasound technician program at the community college in my area. I started taking classes to get into it and now all I need is to take physics and some sort of ranking test to be able to rank for the program, they only take 7 students into this program a year, depending on their GPA and test score. I've gotten As in all my ranking courses so I'm not at a bad place, but I feel like I'm never gonna get there. 


The up-side on all of this is that I began to work at a doctor's office where the doctors and providers (PA's, nurse practitioners) need medical transcriptionists to do documentation and billing for them. I started as a medical assistant but was promoted to scribe. I'm now working with a wonderful doctor who is a nephrologist, specializes in geriatrics, is a licensed surgeon back in Argentina, and became a doctor at 24, he's 38 now. I spend 9 hours a day with him and we've gotten close. He's working at that place (horrible place, may I add) only because of certain circumstances that landed him that job. I don't exactly understand but it has something to do with some sort of waiver. He's explained it before but we don't talk about it much. He was living back in New York before he ended up in El Paso. Long story short, he hates this clinic and the bosses are jerks. He's only trying to finish his contract so that he can get out and work at another practice strictly as a nephrologist. He already signed a contract with a new dialysis company branching into El Paso and he was offered the position of medical director. He promised me to take me with him and employ me, pay me more money, etc. and he mentions that he's glad to have met me because I'm the best scribe/assistant he's ever had. He knows I'm still going for ultrasound technician and has even offered to give me a flexible work schedule while I finish school, and even after I finish, he said he'd employ me as an ultrasound technician as well since nephrologists usually order kidney ultrasounds. 

He's been a huge influence for me and I think he's the only good thing to have come out of my ""college failure"". It's nice to know that I'll have a secure job as long as he's around. But I still feel unfulfilled. I've talked to a lot of people about it and a lot of them are in the same situation I am. Everyone tells me that it's fine to fall behind, that it's normal and it happens to the best of us. That it doesn't matter how old I am or how long it takes to get my degree as long as I get it, and still I can't help but beat myself up whenever I see someone graduating or talking about finishing school and going for even higher education. What I'm doing now is just not what I had planned for myself and I feel like a complete and utter failure. 

I'll be keeping out of fb and instagram for today. Hope you guys have a good weekend. :)

memelord47,1615619562,/r/college/comments/m41cmx/how_to_overcome_feeling_like_youre_stuck_and_out/,"I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Digital Forensics and planning to go for a master's in Cyber Security after this. The thing is, I don't really have much of a passion for computer science and all that. I like using them, but the inner workings of them just don't interest me much and computer/information systems and programming aren't super exciting either. I went with this major and career path because I knew there would always be job security and plenty of money to make in the field, but often find myself looking at my school's list of majors and wondering what it'd be like to do something else. I've looked into a lot of different things, from Pharmacy to Law (my current interest), and other things just seem more interesting to me and seem like they'd be more fulfilling. My problem though is that I just feel like I'm out of time and I feel stuck with this choice. I'm 25, 26 in a few months. I know that's not very old but it FEELS old when you're still stuck at home with parents working part time and still will be for quite a while, can't afford much of anything nice like a new, let alone my own place to live, and still have just under 2 years left before I can start a career and do something with my life. I also think about things like how I won't have any health insurance when I turn 26 since I'll be removed off my parent's insurance, and whenever I mention to one of my parents about having some new ideas for what to do, they usually remind me of my age and far I still have to go on this degree and how I need to finish so I can do something with my life (my other parent tends to be more supportive). It's not really so much that this one parent isn't supportive or doesn't care or anything, they're just looking at the future and trying to look at it from a logical standpoint so I can make a smart move on whatever I choose to do and that that choice will be in my best interest

I started getting interested in being a lawyer and I've been doing some research here and there on law schools near me and what the curriculum and tuition and all that good stuff will be, but I end up getting discouraged when I think about how I'd still need to finish a bachelor's (I'd probably change to a Criminal Justice bachelor's which would take the same amount of time to finish as my current degree which is just under 2 years) and then it'll still take another 3 years to finish law school so I'd basically be 30 or 31 depending on when I could start it, and I've read that it's tough to work full time through most of law school and nigh impossible to do it during the first year (or even part time work for that matter, judging by the course load of the first year). I start thinking about how I'm already stuck at home as it is and can't afford to move out or anything like that and doing something like this I'd REALLY be stuck at home then, and it wouldn't feel good to be 30 still stuck at home and never having moved out a single time. All those feelings get coupled with what my parent says about looking ahead and finishing and pretty much not sticking myself in that very situation I think about being stuck in and I just get discouraged from pursuing anything else. I basically feel stuck with what I chose and with my age and how long I still have left until I finish this degree, I just feel like I'm out of time to do anything else, and I could always go back in the future but I'd like to get it right the first time and not have to do that, you know?? It's really my fault that I'm in this situation anyway because I didn't take school seriously enough in my earlier adult years and I valued leisure (like video games) over education and really looking ahead. I mean I have an associate's degree so I've already been in school for years but I regret not being more aggressive with school and planning my future years ago or else I might be doing one of these other things I've looked at doing. Slacking off on it and not really putting a lot of thought into it is something I'll always regret but hopefully I end up feeling happy and fulfilled and satisfied by the field I'm going into

Regardless, I'm sure all this research on law school won't be the last time I go looking at what all other opportunities are out there and wishing I could actually consider them and do them before it really is too late because of how I get closer and closer each semester to earning this degree

But like the topic says, how can I overcome these feelings of feeling stuck on this path that I'm unsure that I want to do and being out of time to consider other options?? That includes the option of just sticking with this one and going for it too, if that's the best option then how could I get past these modes I get into of looking at other things and just look forward to the career path I've chosen??",college,How to overcome feeling like you're stuck and out of time to change degrees/career paths??,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/m41cmx/how_to_overcome_feeling_like_youre_stuck_and_out/,1615641162.0,can't afford tuition ,6.18
Liz_Asher,1351359501,/r/AskReddit/comments/126hvu/reddit_i_need_help_i_think_my_boyfriend_is/,"I'm feeling really desperate right now. I have no one to talk to, and I need an outside opinion. 

So, let me explain as shortly as possible:
My current boyfriend (let's call him Howel) and I worked together as cashiers for ten months. He was nice, funny, understanding, a gentleman, very well groomed, and he took care of himself everyday. I'm a very insecure, anti-social girl with hardly any friends because I'm so shy while he's pretty much Mr. popularity. We started dating after we both quit (at the same time) because we both liked each other. It was fantastic at the beginning, I had just gotten out of a abusive relationship 4 months earlier, and Howel was so much better than my last boyfriend.

After we quit it was so hard for us to find jobs. After about a month, he stopped showering (like one shower a week) and he never washed his clothes and it stunk! Me and his parents begged him to keep up with his hygiene, but he refused. Then he suddenly moved out of his parent's house and into mine without my permission. I live in a tiny duplex with my grandmother, and it is very strict here, and we told he couldn't live with us, but he told me he was so lonely without me, so I felt bad and didn't say anything anymore. He never paid any bills and didn't look for a job.

I got a job two months later, and one night while he was driving he wasn't paying attention (I was with him) and he hit a curb going 55 mph in a 45 mph lane because he wasn't looking at the road (and I warned him constantly to pay attention and then go he'd off and rant about how good of a driver he was). He tore the transmission up and his car was totaled out, and now he doesn't have a vehicle. He then made it ""official"" he was living with me, so he could use my car without my permission. His parents were so pissed he wrecked his car they refused to allow him to live with them so I felt bad and, once again, didn't say anything.

Well he's done way much more, but I'll cut to the important problems that's going on now. This our fifth month dating, and about three weeks ago he took my car (when I told him he couldn't) and got into a wreck. My car is still drivable, but it's a shitty 2003 ford taurus with almost 300,00 miles on it (from him driving between my house, his college, and his parents who live in a different city an hour away almost everyday). This is a HUGE problem. I just started school, and I need that car to get to school because my school is an hour away (that's the closest school to my house btw). The damage is $5000+ and the car is only worth $3000 so if my car gets totaled out then I have to drop out of school! My boyfriend refuses to help. He even gave the cop my insurance information so his rates wouldn't go up. The accident was someone else's fault for hitting my car from behind, but for some reason my insurance rates are going to double, and I might have to pay for it. He won't even say sorry, and when me and my mom asked him about he always says his dad will handle it because he's the attorney general.

He also broke my bed yesterday because he was jumping on it (yes, he's extremely immature) and he made it collapse. This bed was passed down from my great grandmother so it's really special to my family, and he didn't even apologize! He laughed it off, and said he would fix it, and we gave him the tools. He then said he didn't feel like it and refuses to fix it. I asked him today about my car and my bed and he finally gave in, and told me ""Those are YOUR problems not mine. I don't have to pay shit"".

I have no money. My family is very poor, and if my insurance rates double my mom can't afford them, and then my family will be screwed. My car will most likely get totalled out, and then I will have to drop out of school (the school refused to help me at all). Without a car I can't get to work, and me and my grandmother will be evicted because I support the both of us with a job that pays $7.25 per hour (the government barely helps us at all, and this month they took away our food stamps for no reason). 

I'm so scared right now, and I feel like crying. What do I do? Getting a lawyer is not an option, so please don't tell me to sue because that would never work especially with his dad as the attorney general. Obviously I know to break up with him, but if I do his family may not help me with the insurance (his parent's are helping me at least). Please help me Redditors. Just give me some advice that might help. I have no one.

TLDR; my boyfriend stole my car and wrecked it (and broke my bed). He refuses to help, gave the cop MY insurance info and now my insurance rates will double. I might have to drop out of school because of him, and my whole family will go broke.",AskReddit,"Reddit I Need Help, I Think My Boyfriend is Screwing Me Over?",http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/126hvu/reddit_i_need_help_i_think_my_boyfriend_is/,1351381101.0,my family can't afford to pay school for me ,6.173333333333333

So about two years ago, my sister decided to buy a laptop. Now we are not a rich family, so she has never had anything nice in her life, so this was her first purchase of anything that is actually expensive (She paid roughly $1000 for a laptop).  Now a little bit of background, my sister is an incredible artist, has been since she was little.  She has always been interested in drawing on the computer so our family tried to afford drawing tablets (Which, inherently, never worked on our computers nor worked at all).  

So, she had this idea of a drawing tablet in her head for a long time; which brings me to the second characteristic: she is autistic.  Not heavily autistic, but enough to make her a little 'different' and always the subject of harassment from fellow classmates and the target of a lot of anger around the house.  So anyway, back to the problem.  She wanted to make this purchase by herself because it was her money and she knew what she wanted to do with it.  So she looked around for a bit, and she came across the HP Pavillion Touchsmart (I believe it was that one, it's the tablet laptop that had a swivle touchscreen and was small).  She fell in love with this laptop the day she bought it, unbeknownst to its flaws.  She made TONS of gorgeous drawings and pictures (I'll link to her deviant art if people are really curious enough) and this laptop was her life. 

She carried on with this laptop for roughly two years, keeping it in incredible condition.  Of all the computer problems I've fixed in this household, her computer was never one of them, unlike my other sister who is far less careful with her laptop (we will get back to that).  Now recently, my house has been stricken with a sort of computer problem epidemic.  Right before college starts for all of us, my first sister (the one who is less careful with electronics) gets both her laptop and netbook broken, and my second sister (The artistic one who only has this laptop in her life) gets the same problem.  This mortifies both my sisters, since we don't have a lot of money as it is right now and we have even less money to spend on electronics.  They take it to me and I look over them to make sure it's not a software problem (and it wasn't) before they take it to a professional computer repairman.  We have to pay roughly $100 to get them looked over and it was good news and bad news.  

Good news: My first sister's laptop only had a corrupt ram slot and worked fine when ram was taken out of that slot (She got lucky).

Bad news: My second sister's laptop had a broken motherboard.  Dead.

This was mortifying to my second sister; but she had hope.  She heard that this particular laptop had an extended warranty on it because this particular model was a piece of junk and broke easily.  She asked me to call HP and see if I could get some sort of a deal or miracle fix out of the company.  So I call and apparently this particular model of computer has its own customer service line!  I talked to them for a bit, and they told me that it would cost about $329 to repair.  We talked about it for a bit and decided that it would be best to get it repaired because it would at least last her for another year until she could scrounge up enough money for a new laptop.  So she calls HP today to ask about getting her laptop repaired; turns out it costs around $500 to get it repaired!  It was ridiculous!  The support guy apparently even recommended not getting it repaired and just buying another laptop since the repairs would only last about 6 months.  

This was the worst thing that has ever happened to her and she has been in her room all day crying her heart out.  I really feel bad for her; here is this girl that has few good things in her life, sweet as can be, and she has something like this happen to her.  We can't pay for those kinds of repairs and we don't really have the money to buy her this kind of laptop again, and she was only barely able to buy it after she saved up an entire years worth of money from her senior year in high school.  
So here it is, does anybody have any suggestions for this?  Is there anyone we can go to that can fix her laptop for a cheaper price, or are we doomed?  I mean, we could buy her a cheaper laptop, but I think after all these years - she should have at least one nice thing.  What do you say reddit?

tl;dr, My autistic and artistic sister's touchscreen laptop broke, after having it for two years and keeping it in pristine condition.  Contacted customer support, said it would cost $329 in repairs - turns out to be $500, and was advised against doing so.  We aren't a rich family, and that was the one thing she ever really had in her life that was important to her.

throwingviolently,1350600808,/r/AskReddit/comments/11ps9j/am_i_too_violent_how_could_i_control_this_or/,"Are there days you are really angry or frustrated because of what someone is doing is bothering you? And that you'd imagine a scenario where you would beat the complete shit out of him with a bat or some other very gruesome manner?

Well, I can get into that situation from time to time... I do not know why, but I am easily irritated by people who bother me. For instance, like what happened just now. I study in a university on campus, with about 15 other students in my dorm. It's a relatively small house, with small corridors, where I am on the first level. On that same level, there is one guy I particularly hate because he's a disgusting hooligan with no decency and just loves to bother me because he gets gratification from seeing my reaction (telling him off). What he loves to do, with another flatmate, is kick a soccer ball up and down the stairs, which is right beside my room. The noise it makes as it goes down, as well as the ball bouncing off a wall and hitting my door, annoys me so much I want to scream at them from the top of my lungs. To make it worse, the hooligan purposely kicks the ball at my door, scaring me, disrupting my studies(or surfing reddit) and consequently, getting me real mad to the point where I'd want take the ball, break a glass window, and taking the shard to stab his leg. I also have been violent when people enter my personal space such as my room, and not get out when I tell them too because I'm busy. I would always state ""I'm going to punch you if you don't get out"", which I do, from time to time on the arm. In high school, if a friend of mine would use some racial joke towards me (I am Chinese), I would punch his arm too. There have been other past events where I would get mad with other people, but I can't remember it right now, maybe later.

In all honesty, without wanting to seem like the angel (which I am not, clearly from what I just said earlier), I am a nice guy. I do things to help the community, always be genuinely nice to people, minimize talking about small details behind people's back because I realize that I shouldn't say anything (e.g. ""Look at that stupid Obey cap"" *I'm sorry if it may offend someone here). Also, I am polite not because it's some rule I have to abide to, but it's the right thing to do. I don't like seeing trash when someone just leaves it there, so from time to time, I pick it up and throw it away without saying anything. 

I guess, if you redditors want to find the problem about me, I should give you a little bit more details that can be relevant.

* I hate noise. When everything is quiet and someone disrupts it because they are ignorant of what's going on like in a library or in class, I get angry.
* I need my own private space, where I can be alone and concentrate.
* I have a rather large imaginative personal bubble. 
* BUT I am very social and friendly person, willing to hang out with them and have fun. I just like a lot of alone time.
* For some reason, I would get frustrated when my dad asks me to do things in the house. For my mom I would do it without complaining, but when my dad does, I get frustrated. They are not bad parents, they are great. It's just because I can be irrational and I'm closer with my mom than my dad, even if I see the former less (parents divorced) and the latter pays for everything such as my expensive university fees. I guess it's because I can joke about a lot more things with my mom than my dad. He's a very serious man, but always preparing me for the future.  
* I don't like it when people touch my things, or use it without asking and not even showing some form of gratitude.
* Weird thing about me, I can get mad but when I lash it out such as yelling at people, I start to smile because they think it's a joke, or I just can't seem to stay mad in a very serious way. It actually happened yesterday because some friends came back late at night from a club, they had a little drink, and I offered them bread with Nutella or a box of cereal, however, none of them showed any signs of gratitude and then dirtied my floor with all the crumbs and the friend with the smelly feet wouldn't get off my bed, so I had to use my memory foam pillow and smack him repetitively with it.

I am always aware of what I do, bad or good things, and I try to change the bad things but I have difficulty, such as my anger. I do not lash out regularly, but I do get irritated and calmly tell them what it does to me, however that only makes it much worse. So, what do I do? :\ Ask me any other questions that could help you determine my problem.

iamthefalsemichael,1345691872,/r/AskReddit/comments/yocxe/redditors_i_am_a_canadian_citizen_who_recently/,"So here's the deal:

I grew up in Oklahoma, but I was born in Alberta. My parents divorced and my mother took me, my sister, and by brother to OK with her, and married, and still lives there. I went to University for 4 years and got a Batchelor's of Arts in International Language (which is most useful as a platform for a higher degree, not so much in itself, esp. in a depressed economy flooded with graduates). I had a scholarship, I took out Stafford loans (which I don't intend to default on because they do not go away, and any permanent return to the US would be greeted by paycheck garnishment/ much larger debt than I started with) and I opened four credit cards, which I used because all my life I heard about how important it is to ""build credit"" (with every intention to pay them off, of course, having had little/no experience with real life living/working and no idea how inadequate my income would be to repay what I was spending. Knowing that it would be all on credit, I even took a month-long vacation to Australia in 2009. It was amazing. Totally worth it.

In the aftermath of graduation I had a series of low paying labor jobs in the USA until I finally obtained US citizenship (I am a dual citizen now) and hopped on the first flight home to Vancouver, B.C., the 3-generation home of my father's side of the family. 

Because of a $9,000 check from life-insurance policy taken out on me by my grandfather when I was born (cashed because it had began to lose money instead of grow) I was able to get an awesome reliable car (1998 Civic Si) that got me an awesome job (Pizza delivery) while I went to trade school (thanks to my awesome dad) that got me an electrician's apprenticeship. I am doing well in Canada, and I have no intention of returning to the United States in the next couple decades, except to visit my mother, who will hopefully choose to leave Oklahoma now that her children have all relocated to greener pastures on the west coast (also, Oklahoma has no more water. Fact)

I almost spent that check to repay all my credit cards.

Now, although I can afford to keep paying the minimums, in addition to my student loans...

I'm not sure I want to.

I get that it's a strange position to be in, being capable of repaying the debt but just ""not wanting to"" - and I could be accused (and will be) of being selfish, immoral, and whatever else, because there are people out there who CAN'T pay their credit cards and live in stress because they can't just leave the country and forget about them.

But I honestly do not feel morally obligated to pay. Not in the least. I know how credit card companies operate. I know they prey on the inexperience and I was inexperienced. I also view the interest rates as usury, regardless of whether or not I accepted them in order to have a card. I was brought up to believe that I had to build credit in order to have a decent future.

Without those credit cards I would have learned *years* earlier the value of money and what it really takes to earn money and how carefully we should treat it.

**what I plan to do**
Stop paying my credit card minimums. Allow all of them to go into default. This is not declaring bankruptcy. They can sue me for the full amount if they feel it is great enough (which they may) and I will obviously not show. This is not a criminal issue, it is a civil issue between me and creditors. The court would issue a judgement against me, allowing the credit card companies to try and get me to pay up the full amount. I have no assets in the country. They don't know where I live and even if they did, the court in Oklahoma has no jurisdiction here. The statute of limitations on credit card debt in OK is 3 years. Then I am not responsible for the debt. They might try to sell the debt to a collection agency, but if that was ever a problem for me I would only have to show up and tell the court that the debt was outside of the statute of limitations. I realize that this would damage my US credit score. It would not destroy it for life, and it would not affect my Canadian credit score. (Yes, they're separate). **even bankruptcy only remains on your credit history for 7 years** so I don't see this being a problem for me if I return to the USA many years from now with a good job, experience, and savings..

Addresses I have used with my credit card include my mother's address in Oklahoma. But she was never cosigner on any of my financial accounts. The worst inconvenience I am aware of is that an officer might show up and ask her if I live there, to which she may reply that I moved to Canada. Jurisdiction is a bitch, eh? Please let me know if that's not the case.

Looking for work in the UK is very different from here. They operate a lot with employment agencies so there are a whole load of them dedicated to just social work / social care. Also they have equal opportunity laws so they're are no internal postings - all jobs are open to everyone. MSW positions were rare.

The agencies often recruit from overseas and sometimes offer flight bonuses. My flight was paid for after 3 months of working for them. When I first went to meet them they set up 3 interviews for me within a couple of days. From the time I arrived, I had a job within 7 days (including settling in, seeing some sights, meeting with my agency, going to 3 interviews &amp; landing all 3). There are so many agencies out there so sign up with a few - whichever gets you the job you want where you want it, stick with them. Don't feel you have to be loyal to agencies, they make money off your back so if another agency finds you the job you want, switch over. The agency that paid my flight was paying me less than a student so I switched over as soon as I found that out.

You can begin the registration process from overseas - ask them to do the criminal record check (CRB) as this is the part that takes the longest. (I knew people who waited 9 months to get theirs &amp; you can't work until that's done) I suggest you have one done where you live so that it shows no record right up to that point. I had one done just before leaving Canada &amp; that sped things up significantly. A new CRB check must be done before starting any job there (thanks to the school caretaker who murdered 2 ten year olds) which is why it can take so long.

There is also the social work weekly magazine - Community Care - so have a look online for more permanent positions.  http://www.communitycare.co.uk. One Council I worked for actually went to job fairs in North America to recruit &amp; had people come on 2 year contracts but I don't know the details.

In my time, you had to be a member of the General Social Care Council but it has changed names to the Health Professionals Council. http://www.hpc-uk.org  It's the professional order that allows you to practice with the social worker title. Since you qualified overseas you will need to do the extensive application to ensure your qualifications meet their standards. A definite must before arriving in the country. (The Republic of Ireland has their own so if you want to go to Dublin - it's a separate country with separate rules - Northern Ireland, Wales &amp; Scotland operate the same as the UK)

Depending where you want to go, get a job before finding a place to live. London is huge! Everyone uses public transport so make sure you're not too far from where to work. But not too close! You don't want to live in the same area where you work because you will run into your clients everywhere (really!). There's no harm in some traveling to avoid that! I got the same job in different areas so I found a place to live &amp; accepted the closer job.

Lots of different advice for living there but doing a flat share is the best way to integrate &amp; not get isolated. Gumtree is one of the best sites for that (similar to Craigslist). https://www.gumtree.com You'll also find employment agencies on there. I booked into a hostel for the first 4 weeks. Don't do it for too long, it's expensive &amp; you don't want to be sharing a shower with 20 other people when you have to get to work. Flat share is the best way to go - try to set something up ahead of time. A hostel is good in the sense you then have flexibility to move where to find work. Whatever works best for you but don't wait until you get there.

Banking will be your biggest challenge. To get paid you need a bank account. To get a place to live to need a bank account. To get a bank account you need a place to live. See if there's any way you can open an account from home - that was the biggest challenge. I opened a HSBC account in Canada and they reluctantly opened an account for me. My ex had to go through an old family friend who had to vouch for him. It was not easy but maybe online banking has improved things.

Refer to immigration/traveling websites for this kind of advice.

I think that's it for now. If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer throughout the day but here are the most important things you'll need...

Essential things:

1-Membership in Health Professional Council (professional order) http://www.hpc-uk.org

2-Employment Agency (including CRB)

3-Bank account

4-Temporary place to stay at the beginning

Good luck!

that_veg,1458088184,/r/college/comments/4alc9f/my_dad_doesnt_want_me_to_major_in_what_ive/,"The title is exactly the way it sounds. I'm a sophomore in an out of state college and have barely gotten close to past the GenEds stage of college yet I have already declared a major in Exercise Science/Kinesiology, Pre Physical Therapy. This major is science heavy, and it turns out I actually really dislike science and am not doing well enough to get into a grad school in my important major courses (I have done fine in my GenEds). I'm a terrible test taker and I don't retain memorized knowledge very well. I am better at learning when I have an actual physical task at hand. I did terribly in my second general Chemistry course and I am doing even worse in Anatomy. My advisor warned me that if I do poorly in courses like Anatomy and Physiology, graduate school is almost out of the question. It's only going to keep getting more difficult.

I figured out that I am really passionate about writing. I thought about changing my major to something more English-related about 5-6 months ago. I realized I wasn't happy in my science courses and I couldn't continue faking it for my parents, who both had/have science careers. I decided journalism seems like something for me - every teacher or professor that I have encountered in an English related setting has told me I have some kind of talent for writing - and I felt like a very tangible career could come from this. I met with an advisor to get my credits in order - I have 57 credit hours in my kinesiology major, and those would transfer over to the journalism major perfectly, meaning I can still graduate on time. We got all my classes for the next four semesters lined up for registration.

I waited a few weeks to hit my parents with the news. I told my dad first and his response was not at all what I expected. Right when I told him ""Hey, dad, I've been thinking that I am going to change my major to journalism."" Right off the bat, he said there is no career in journalism. Then he said immediately after that if I pursue that as my major, he is not going to pay for it and I can come home and take a year off to figure myself out and finish out my degree at home because he's not going to waste any more money on me. The funny thing is, it's taken me two years to finally feel like I know what I want to do. Not only that, but it's taken me this long to finally build up a community for myself that I feel comfortable in at my college, I've joined a cultural sorority, and I've been really involved in campus and I can't see myself letting that go. If I take a year off of school, how am I going to figure out what I want to do if I'm not taking classes that harbor that kind of growth and self-actualization?

My school is expensive, but he's not realizing that I wouldn't be attending 3+ years of graduate school on top of my out-of-state tuition already if I pursued journalism. He would rather see me unhappy making a decent check in a science career than to see me in a writing/arts career. All of the sudden he has decided that he no longer has the money to pay for my school, because scholarships and financial aid as well as me working as much as possible don't exist outside of his bank account. I'm willing to do what I can to stay exactly where I am.

This morning he sent me this email:
""I just want to write to you to tell you what is on our minds regarding school plans and what I think you need to do over the next year.

With the cost of out of state tuition at [college x] we would have to consume all or our non retirement savings which would leave no emergency funds in case I lost my job if you were to remain at [college x]. Given that your are uncertain about your major and you want to change plans with school I think the best thing for you to do would to be to come home in June and finish your education here, maybe take a year off to work to get a better idea of what you want to do continuing your education. There is nothing wrong with taking time to make a good decision for your future. I am not sure how you became interested in photo journalism. I am sure that you could pursue that here as well as at [college x].""

I have felt for the past two years that my parents have been looking for reasons to pull me out of this school due to the out of state fees. It's funny because, just last summer, my dad was arguing against my mom to keep me going here - she wanted me to take a year off and stay home and work, and he wouldn't let her decide that for me.

I sent an email back explaining my stance and reasoning, and it was quite long. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I understand that my dad pays the checks, but I feel like it doesn't give him the right to disallow me to attend college because I am not pursuing the major he wants me to.",college,My dad doesn't want me to major in what I've decided to,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4alc9f/my_dad_doesnt_want_me_to_major_in_what_ive/,1458109784.0,can't pay for school,6.14
[deleted],1328582522,/r/AskReddit/comments/pe2ka/how_do_i_save_my_drug_abusing_brother_from/,"Firstly, my brother is a smart and attractive guy. He would be totally capable to do anything he set his mind to if he wanted. That being said, he doesn't want to do a thing. He's a college senior now, and his grades have steadily tanked the past 4 years. He stopped applying himself, quit all athletics, and now has a bottom quartile GPA. (Ranked around 700 in a class of 800) He is in mostly AP classes and scores well on tests. He just won't do the leg work. His SAT score is a 2150. He only applied to 2 colleges, both very large public schools in Texas, and I don't think he is going to get into either.

While I am an ent myself, and do recreationally use drugs, he abuses them. He is high constantly and steals money from everyone in my family to support his pot habit. I know he has used other drugs but this is the only one he uses daily. It makes me so sad to know that he can't balance his priorities. On more than one occasion he has stolen prescription medication from me, which totals to more than $300. When I catch him stealing money from me and my family members, he apologizes, but makes no effort to pay us back. He doesn't even seem to regret it. He has said before that ""he isn't upset about the stealing, but that I always catch him.""

He is capable of being sweet, when he wants something. For example, food, money, or a ride somewhere. He gets nasty when he doesn't get what he wants. Just not wanting to do something for him isn't a valid excuse. If I am not using my car or computer, and he wants to borrow it, in his mind I am not allowed to say no. He is entitled to my things if it isn't 'putting me out'. When I flatly refused to give him the car keys, he went out and stabbed two of my car tires, which I had to pay to replace. His logic was ""if he couldn't go somewhere, I shouldn't be able to either."" Later he admitted that the action was disproportional to how angry he should have been, but that he was still in the right for doing so.

He justifies stealing from me because I have an income. I have a job and therefore have money. I am also a student. I have to pay for all of this. I am already stretched very thin, which he doesn't seem to understand or even consider. He just sees that I have something that he doesn't, and seems to think he is entitled to it just because it's there and not being used. He refuses to get a job to help afford his lifestyle. He ""never wants to work a day in his life."" He aspires to go to film school.

How do I live with this!? If I comply with his ridiculous behavior and demands, I have a house full of his druggie friends who steal from my family. One of his best friends, who we let live with us for a year, stole my ipod and my 8 year old brother's Nintendo DS and sold them. They come over every day and smoke in his room or our backyard. If I don't comply, his behavior is worse. He will still steal my things and abuse everything I own. When I stand up to him, he will take his frustration out on my younger siblings, usually in a violent manner. He has never really hit my sister or I, but will hit my brothers. It's a constant lose-lose battle.

My mom and dad are pretty much out of the picture. My mom, when not at work, is out at bars or with friends. She is almost always drinking and prefers to not interact with us. While she does bankroll the house and food funds, she does no parenting whatsoever. The nights she comes home, she will go into her room to drink and watch TV. If any of the children interrupt this time, she will verbally lash out at us. Besides that, she has no real control over any situation in the house. We do our thing and she does hers. My dad is separated and in Afghanistan, so he is out of the picture as well. My older brother tries sometimes, but has a job and can't really be concerned with what's going on at home. I'm 20 and am raising 4 kids and an alcoholic mother basically on my own. One of which is a manipulative drug abuser. I want to protect my siblings. I just don't know how to get him to see that his actions negatively affect us all and that he is detrimental to everything I have worked so hard to keep intact.

Will this ever cease? How do I stop a violent and manipulative person who will not leave our home? My mother will never allow us to kick him out, no matter what he does. Am I forced to live with his choices and terrible behavior forever? Even if I leave, I am leaving 3 younger siblings who won't be able to escape him or my alcoholic mother for another 4-8 years.

I was optimistic. I chose the cheapest school I could find that supported my major. I had received two scholarships from my school. I qualified for federal aid. Perhaps it would all be enough to cover the cost of my first year. But it wasn’t. I received the bill, and to my dismay, came short by $12,000. I had never liked the idea of loans, having heard countless horror stories over the years, but I asked my parents to co-sign anyway. They refused and I’m inclined to believe that’s a good thing, as it made me reconsider wether college was really necessary, even if it would be easier than other options. (For my major it’s not, but I acknowledge that for some it is.)
                 I did a bit of research and a lot of calculating, curious to know what kind of outlook would await me had I been able to borrow loans for school. In the worst case scenario I would NEVER, ever be able to pay off the debt because the interest would outpace what I could contribute. In the best case scenario, it would take me 17 years to pay it off, if, and only if, I spent every single dollar I had on my loan. That would mean almost two decades barely scraping by, forced to give up any small joys in life. That would mean no fun trips and outings, no new video games or other personal items, no gifts for loved ones, not even so much as a movie ticket.
             But realistically it would be much harder than that to pay off because there would be necessities I would have no choice but to spend money on. Most household appliances and essential devices (such as a phone) are designed not to last longer than 5-7 years. I would have to replace something at least twice in that time frame. And a set of clothes lasts about 1-3 years depending on quality and how often it’s worn. That would mean I would have to pay for a new wardrobe at least 3 or 4 times. Each one of these purchases would push the time it takes to be debt free further and further. It would be quite possible, even, to find myself under the hand of the law if I simply couldn’t pay. 
               With these facts in mind, it’s safe to say that education is no longer about teaching the youth, passing knowledge to the next generation, nor empowering people with better career options. it’s about marketing, profits, and most importantly, lining the coffers of those who sit at the top. The only person benefiting is someone you’ll likely never meet, someone who certainly doesn’t care about you. 
          Yet people talk about student loans so flippantly, as if it isn’t completely disastrous for a nation to enslave the majority of its young with unplayable debt. From an early age we’re pushed in this direction. At first we’re asked what we want to be when we grow up. It’s an innocent enough question, but that’s not where it ends. We’re drilled all throughout school to achieve good grades because if you don’t, no college will accept you. In high school we’re told to join clubs because it will look good on college applications. Then we’re presented with aptitude tests to see what career we should pursue and as we get closer to our senior year, we’re hounded to pick one, assured that college is the only way we can obtain it. Afterwards we’re urged to apply to colleges and enter private scholarships we’re not likely to win. We’re sent home with pamphlets for our parents, informing them of all they need to know to fund our success, including loan options. Meanwhile, the whole time we’re being marched right into the gaping maw of a wolf. 
         The whole idea of higher education has become predatory. Why else would there be an entire market dedicated to private student loans? Surely they wouldn’t exist, or be as prominent as they are, if there was no one at the other end reaping in the benefits. Colleges also gain in this process because they know no matter how high their asking price is, students will still attend, enabled to do so by private loans. The schools get paid with no risk to themselves, meanwhile students build their futures overtop sinkholes. This incentivizes them to continue raising the price of tuition and fees year after year. And raise it they shall. Over the past couple years I watched as a few schools I had been prospecting raised their tuition by 10% per year. While other institutions didn’t take such a dramatic price hike, they still make a steady climb of at least a couple thousand per year. I doubt any one of them has a reason to quit anytime soon, and I imagine the same thing is happening in schools all over the United States.
          In the end, I chose to spare myself the nightmare and walk away, though I’ll be looking for less expensive ways to reach my goals. As a message to anyone reading this, think long and hard before you sign on that loan. Do your research, figure out how much your target career pays vs. the cost of living. Then take into account interest rates and how they’ll affect the overall cost of loans after you graduate. Remember that federal loans add up too. Look at all your alternative options. I wish you the best of luck.",college,College is No Longer About Learning,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wam721/college_is_no_longer_about_learning/,1659066033.0,school is too expensive,6.12
[deleted],1426938672,/r/college/comments/2zsr52/cant_decide_where_to_go_to_college_help_is/,"I've received most of my admissions decisions back from the colleges that I applied to, and I truly cannot decide the best college to attend. I'm not looking for any definitive decisions right now, but I was hoping that the collective knowledge of r/college could possibly help guide me in the decision making process. 

I've been accepted to the University of Michigan (LSA), Washington University in St. Louis (Arts and Sciences), Northeastern University (D'Amore-McKim School of Business), Indiana University (Pre-Admit to Kelley School of Business, Hutton Honors College), Bentley University (Honors Program), and the University of Maryland (Scholars Program, Pre-Admit to Smith School of Business). I was rejected by the University of Virginia, and I was waitlisted by Boston College. I am still waiting on decisions from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Lehigh University.

Before I discuss what I think about these colleges, here's some context that will most likely make the decision much harder. My parents have agreed to contribute a significant amount of the cost of college, but I will certainly have to take out student loans to pay for school, wherever I go. Accounting for merit aid that I have received, my family contribution, and the total cost of attending each of these schools, I will have to take out the following in loans to attend each of these schools: UMD ($24,000), IU Bloomington ($40,000), NEU ($56,000), WashU ($70,000), Bentley ($48,000), UMich ($108,000). These estimated costs also account for the increasing rate of tuition (Adjusted for 5% annually), the increasing cost of housing (Adjusted for 2% annually), books, meal plans, personal expenses, and transportation costs. I really do not want to put myself in a position where I'll have to pay off student debt for decades after I graduate, but at the same time, I want to attend the best school that I can, and graduate in a position to get a job in the financial services industry. Currently, I'm thinking that I'd like to enter corporate accounting, investment banking or consulting, but I am open to really any position in a similar field. 

In terms of what I want out of a college, I do value the opportunity to go to big sports games and have a sense of school spirit (Which I really wouldn't have at a place like WashU or Bentley). I would also like to be at a medium to large sized school (which discounts Bentley). The idea of flying to a school isn't too appealing, but I am not opposed to it if it's necessary to go to the school that's right for me. Being in or close to a city is something that appeals to me as well, which is why I'm hesitant to go to a place like Indiana. I also want to be at a college with a relatively active social scene and things to do on the weekend, which I'm sure is really possible at any school I go to. Additionally, I don't want to put myself in a position where I have to study relentlessly on the weekends and have no social life due to the work load or course rigor, which is why I'm also hesitant to go to a place like WashU. I've heard from current students and relatives of current students that WashU is incredibly hard to succeed at due to the nature of the coursework and the difficulty of the programs offered there. I also recognize the fact that it's unrealistic for me to expect to satisfy all of these needs at one college while also keeping my student debt to a minimum, which is why I'm so conflicted with this decision.

One of the things that's factoring into my decision greatly is school rankings and the general reputation of the schools I'm considering. I recognize the fact that rankings really have no bearing on the quality of education or job placement at a school, but for some reason I can't justify going to a school the caliber of UMD or Indiana after being accepted to a school like WashU. 

Wherever I go, I'll most likely be attending the undergraduate business school within that college, which also factors into my decision. While Indiana University isn't necessarily highly regarded nationally, the Kelley School of Business is very highly ranked in terms of undergraduate business programs. I really don't know how a program like Kelley at Indiana compares to a program like D'Amore-McKim at Northeastern or Smith at UMD. While the other aspects of this decision are certainly important to me (School spirit, location, social life, etc), really the most important thing to me is that I put myself into a position to get a well-paying job right out of college. I'm unsure whether or not I'll want to pursue graduate school after my undergrad education, but I think that's a decision to make further down the road. 

Any input on my decision is appreciated, particularly from those redditors that currently attend/attended the school's that I'm considering. If you have any input on my conflict with student debt, my decision with regard to the caliber of each school, or any of the aspects that I mentioned that play a factor in this decision, your help would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any experience with or knowledge of the standing of these schools with regard to employers in the financial services industry, that input would be greatly appreciated as well.

Demosthenes72,1280514830,/r/AskReddit/comments/cvl8a/upgrades_looking_for_advise_on_potential_laptop/,"My years old laptop died recently (unmountable boot drive) and I need a computer for school. Thus, I’m going to buy, through a school program, a new Dell Latitude E6510. I am now trying to determine which of the upgrade options I will purchase, but I have questions about many of them. I’ve tried to answer all of my questions with Google and Wikipedia. Some have been answered and some have not. For those still unanswered, I’ve come to you. 

My computing needs are modest; I will use this machine primarily to browse the internet and to type papers, but if I should take a course in digital video or java or anything of the like, I want it to be usable there. So I ask you this: 


**Processors**

* What will it mean to my experience that my computer will have an IC i5-520M 2.4GHz processor; should I splurge on either an i5-540M 2.53Ghz, an i7-620M 2.66Ghz, or an i7-720QM 1.66Ghz?

   * What do Ghz mean with respect to processors?
   
   * How significant is the practical difference between dual and quad core processors? Doesn’t it depend on whether a given piece of software is designed to use the cores properly? If so, how much mainstream software (e.g. Microsoft Office, Firefox, et. Al.) will be able to make full or even appreciable use of a quad vs. dual core processor?

   * What else should I know about my processor before I decide to buy it?

**RAM**

* Should I get 2, 4, or 8 GB of RAM? I know RAM's function and I know that in theory, more is better, but I can't tell you how much RAM most of the machines I've used have had (I think my most recent had 1 GB after an upgrade. I think it was shipped with some measure of MB of RAM), so I have almost no frame of reference regarding the practical significance of different amounts of RAM.
   
   * Am I reading the spec “8GB DDR3 – 1333MHz 2DIMMS (64-bit OS)” correctly if I interpret it to mean that my RAM modules will have their own OS? If not, what is the 64-bit OS and what will it mean to me? If so, will that OS cause any problems for me in its interactions with Windows? Will it make it more complicated for me to re-format if/when I need to? Will it do anything strange with my external HDD?

**Storage**

* Why are SSDs more expensive than even those HDDs with more storage space? Are they really that durable? Do they really operate so swiftly? Wikipedia would have me believe that their ability to preserve information in the absence of power is noteworthy; am I mistaken in thinking that my HDDs have always done that? In other words, what do I misunderstand about “As of 2010, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, which retains memory even without power. SSDs using volatile random-access memory (RAM) also exist for situations which require even faster access, but do not necessarily need data persistence after power loss.”? Should I choose a SSD over a HDD?

* The battery options include a 6-cell, a 9-cell, and a 9-cell Li ion w/3 yr warranty. I don’t care about the warranty; will I be safe in assuming that the first two options are also Li ion batteries? 

* How probable is it that built in Bluetooth will be useful? Could it interfere with WiFi? Regarding wireless peripherals, is there anything more to it than that it will allow me to use them without plugging a USB receiver into my computer?

**OS**

* I will choose either Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate; these questions are about features present in Ultimate, but absent from Professional. 

   * Have you ever found it useful or necessary to employ drive encryption to protect your personal computer? Is it likely that an undergraduate student will have need of such encryption? 

   * What UNIX applications might I find useful if I splurge on Ultimate? 

   * Would a license to run virtual machines on my computer do me any good if I ever choose to replace Windows with a UNIX OS? Would it do me any good in any other situation? Would it actually provide a tool to help me set these VMs up or would it just make it legal for me to help myself in setting them up? 

   * What’s the difference between Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit and Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit? Why are both upgrades offered at the same price?

**Graphics**
 
* My potential graphics cards are: Intel HD and NVIDIA NVS 3100M. I’m no PC gamer, but I like my pages to scroll smoothly, and my DVDs or web videos to play smoothly, even when I have 70+ tabs open in my browser and few other apps running. I do play some RTSs, mostly older stuff like Metal Fatigue and Civ 3, but I may buy Starcraft 2 and I want it to play well without my disabling too many features or its lagging. Do I need more than the Intel card?

Edit: Having reviewed gman1023's Asus link and other Asus laptops thereafter I've come to wonder why Asus computers are so much less expensive than their comparably equipped competitors. Just about every Asus on amazon is cheaper than my school's ""deal"". Are they really as good as anything else or (if I buy one) will it be as if I had bought Walmart toaster pastries expecting real Poptarts?",AskReddit,Upgrades?

I’m in my late-20s and disabled.  I have a litany of medical conditions: several respiratory conditions, a heart condition, a muscular condition, and a degenerative kidney disorder.  I also suffer from clinical depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and mild Autism.  I am under treatment for these conditions, and have been since high school, but they have left me unable to hold a job all of my life.

My parents divorced when I was 14 and I have lived with my mother ever since.  She has been supporting me all of her life.  Three years ago she was forced to retire from her job with the state government (new boss, new team, etc.) and has been supporting us with her retirement pension and savings ever since.  She never let me know just how bad things were until the last few months, I suppose she didn’t want me to worry or feel ashamed.  But things have gotten bad.

For the last three years she has been drawing money from her savings every month to cover our bills; her retirement pension hasn’t been enough.  She’s had to take out something like $1600 a month from savings, and now the money has run out.  There isn’t anything left in her savings.  For the last couple months she has been trying to find ways to cut our expenses down and break even with her retirement pension.  One of the first things she tried was calling creditors and asking them for help lowering monthly payments.  She has $22,000 in credit card debt.  Of all the creditors she spoke to, only two were willing to do anything and the savings amounted to maybe $20 or $30 a month.  

She was encouraged by her credit union to seek debt counseling from a service they have.  She went through the process and gave them all the information.  The process was quite slow and didn’t amount to much.  Their conclusion was that out of the $700 a month in credit card payments she makes they could lower it by about $300; but they saw that as immaterial because she would still be $1300 in the hole each month.  So they told her that her only option was to earn more money.

She tried to refinance the mortgage on our house but didn’t go well.  She spent several weeks talking to so many people, trying to apply for programs like HARP and HAMP or Making Home Affordable, only to find out she doesn’t qualify for one reason or another: the mortgage is not expensive enough, she earns too much money before taxes, it doesn’t seem to matter that she has to support her disabled son, not just herself.  She’s spoken to several FHA counselors who have told us there’s nothing we or they can do.  The mortgage company itself said the same, as our home is worth less than what we owe because of the housing crisis.  Her attempts to refinance her car loan were also fruitless.  No companies want to help you out when you’re in debt and over your head.

It’s become pretty clear that the only option to significantly reduce our monthly bills is for her to file bankruptcy.  She’s spoken to a lawyer and begun the process.  The lawyer said that we’ll probably be able to keep our house as they won’t want to touch it because of the value vs. what we owe.  Her car is another matter and up in the air.  But there’s a larger problem; even after a bankruptcy our expenses still outweigh her pension by about $900 a month.  She doesn’t know what to do and is despondent and so am I.  I have all these expenses, medical bills, medications, health insurance (State insurance of last resort, it’s incredibly expensive), and she has her own health problems and medications as well.  Not to mention the normal costs of living.

I don’t know what to do.  I’m ashamed I can’t hold down a job to help her.  I feel terrible about myself and I can’t think of any way to help.  I know I’m a burden on her and if I wasn’t around she would be able to pay for her own expenses.  I’ve thought about Social Security Disability, but from what I’ve read I don’t think I qualify as I’ve never worked and held a job before.  Even if I did everything I’ve read says it can take more than a year to get benefits and will almost certainly require that I appeal decisions repeatedly and may need a lawyer.  I’ve thought about food stamps but I’m not sure I qualify for them either.  She’s talked about getting a part-time job, but she’s in her mid-60s and not in the best of health, and even then a part-time job might not be enough.

Reddit, what can I do?  Please help me think of things I or my mom can do to help turn this around.  Are there programs I can apply for that I don’t know about, or that she can apply for?  Are there grants I can apply for?  What can we do?

[deleted],1352682530,/r/AskReddit/comments/131cts/reddit_when_have_you_been_friends_with_a/,"Just wanted to share a slice of my life with people and hear some stories. I’m a college sophomore, 19 year old average joe.

Let’s begin with how I met this person: I was at my college apartment on the internet fucking bored to tears since school wasn’t to start until a few days later. I log on to my school email and realize that I have been dropped from all my classes due to college fees not paid in time. (Not my fault, don’t ask me why please)

I panic and decide to go to my school counselor that day for help. I was then waiting anxiously in line for the office, until I bump into this random person. I like to compliment people, especially whenever they have nice sunglasses, and his looked either super expensive or super cheap. I decided to anyway. He proceeds to thank me and then we sign-up for counseling. After he asking me where the transfer center is, we introduce ourselves and began talking about where we came from, what major, blah blah blah. He seemed like a really nice guy, so I invited him to have dinner at my place.

I call him up at the time we agreed to meet, and we have a casual conversation. I never expected anything, especially since he did not drive a super-fancy car or wear extremely expensive clothes. We then talked about entrepreneurship, one of my great passions.

Then **BANG.**

It turns out he is a major celebrity and son of one of China’s wealthiest families. A private yacht is worth pennies to him. He has more luxury suits alone than I have clothes combined. He is literally everything a girl could ask for; rich, talented, smart; funny, fun to hang out with. The mind boggling question exploded in my mind: What in the fuck are you doing in my apartment eating dinner with ME? It was my first time meeting a celebrity, and I was surprised as how he never flaunted his wealth or acted snobbish. When I went shopping with him he would even buy the cheapest brands ironically. I just continued to act normal around him. 

A few more times we hang out and then I notice some bad qualities about him; he is a cheating bastard. He has had so many past girlfriends it makes my head spin, and he continuously cheats for the “better” girl. By this point I’m pretty good friends with him, so I ask him why he does it. “He responds, “Because I’m a guy and I like hot girls.” This makes my stomach cringe. I just naturally shrug and say “oh.” =/ I also noticed he blames mistakes on other people and never takes responsibility; his arrogance with money also slowly shows itself over time.

As school starts we hang out less…and less. Until he stopped responded to my texts to hang out or grab lunch. I then bump into him a couple days ago after weeks, and he says “I’m not ignoring you, I’m just busy.” (With a fraternity of course) I never expected to see him after the dinner alone, so I wasn’t too hurt or surprised by the silence. I never wanted to be friends with him because of his money or fame…I simply liked hanging out with him since he was nice. I viewed him as a human being; not a celebrity, not a god, just a human. I am still FB friends with him, but I feel we have completely lost connection. I just don’t think he gives a shit anymore. I mean, why would he? He’s super rich and doesn’t need a guy like me I guess, I don’t think I can blame him. What truly makes me sad is that I thought he was a good person who liked me for who I am, and I feel I have lost a good friend.  My past relationships with people have never been exactly too good, so it was just a familiar pain I suppose. He kept telling me I should join a fraternity, but I feel that a fraternity is buying your friends. It just isn’t for me. 

Overall, he was a fun, cool person to hang out with at first. Then I realized he was just another person, and people change over time. It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life, but also one of the most valuable lessons I've learned. I’m still young, so I have a lot more to learn and experience. The question I ask myself is whether if I was lucky or not to have lost contact him.


**Tl:dr** I met one the son of one of China’s wealthiest families. Was a normal and modest guy at first, then I notice some stereotypical “rich kid” characteristics about him and lose connection as school starts.

What are some of your friendships with celebrities like?

Srry if it sounds like a rant or is one, I'm not really good expressing myself virtually.

**EDIT 1** I am not generalizing that all fraternities are bad, I only meant that it's something not meant for me. If a fraternity you're in allows you to build friendship and values, good for you. It's only my opinion I feel it's buying friends for ME alone. I have hung out with some fraternities before blindly accepting the ""movie"" stereotypes about them. Check out a frat or sorority at your school before making judgements though.

i_hit_a_parked_car,1309601688,/r/AskReddit/comments/iewy1/i_hit_a_parked_car_the_person_i_hit_may_not_have/,"I hit a parked car yesterday morning in the lot of my office building as I was heading to work. I was checking to see if I had my key card to the building in my glove compartment when it happened. The passenger side of my car hit the driver side of the other car. My car had some minor cosmetic damage, but the frame and engine were fine. The car I hit has scrapes from the driver-side door and the front left fender, I also took out his driver-side view mirror and scratched up his door as well as other parts of body on the driver-side which is all cosmetic damage.

I met with the owner of the car, ""Carlos"", hoping to work something out. Carlos is a Mexican construction worker working next door, and he can't speak English. His co-worker, also his cousin ""Frank"" was present on-site to interpret for us and out of guilt I told him I would write him a check to cover for the damage I caused if he could get back to me with a quote, so that way we didn't have to get our insurance companies involved which he stated he prefer to do. ""John"" wanted some collateral so that I could prove that I wouldn't run away from the incident, I provided him with my phone number but I reiterated that I didn't want to get my insurance company involved, assuming that he wouldn't want his insurance to get involved neither. ""Frank"" kept pushing for me to give up my and driver license number or my address, I told him that I wasn't comfortable with that but I asked them to give me a benefit of the doubt that I would do my best to rectify the situation, especially since the construction workers had a still had some work to finish in the building for the next two weeks which ensured that I would have to run into them in the near future. The owner finds this reasonable and agrees to this. Nothing is signed, we have only made a verbal agreement, and I have never found out if Carlos is insured in the first place.

My driving record is relatively clean, I have only had one traffic ticket ever (making a right turn at an intersection just before a red light), that occurred last year which has been cleared through the traffic school, and the one accident I had was 5 years ago when I began driving. In hindsight, I should of exchanged insurance information as it would of been less work for me to commit too. I have a ""fully-covered"" plan and it would help me get my money's worth of the insurance so it would spare me from paying an immediate expensive repairs. Lastly if Carlos didn't have insurance it would free me from any threat or liability that I would have if he was going to make a claim to my insurance company. I still want to compensate Carlos even if he didn't have insurance as I caused the damage to his car in the first place.

I get a text later from Frank on stating that I might have hit the front-left tire which caused Carlos to steer wobbly on his way home, he offered to let me take pictures of it so that I document this, I agree to this and we will plan to meet over the weekend to arrange this. At this point I am griping at the fact this repair may be much more costly than I thought, especially if I have to pay for it out of my own pocket which I am really dreading as I am broke college student making barely enough to pay for tuition and living expenses. 

I consult with a friend who just graduated law school who stated that getting my insurance involved would of been the best option in the long run, but since I had already chosen to agree to handle this issue without my insurance company, I should draft and notarize an agreement to prevent him from going after me and my insurance company after he gets my money. I consult with another friend who works as a claims representative at an auto insurance company, and he agrees with the law student's statement, but he adds the cost of repairing the the vehicle could exceed my budget in which case it would be best to get my insurance company involved. He also mentioned that if the Carlos was insured and if I didn't have enough to help him, that we would all be SOL.

I am going to approach Carlos and ask him if he does have insurance. I hoping he does so we can let our companies try to resolve this if he is willing to agree, but I don't know what to do if he is uninsured, especially if the cost of his repairs exceed my budget.

Redditors, is there anything else that I should take into consideration before proceeding? Are there any mechanics that could give me a rough estimate if I were post up pictures of the damage? Any substantial advice is appreciated, and thank you in advance!

**tldr: I hit a parked car, the other party might not have insurance, in which case I might not be able to afford compensating them for repairs on the damages I caused, what should I do?**

[deleted],1294530463,/r/AskReddit/comments/eyp5k/i_just_got_my_first_semester_college_grades_and_i/,"So here's the scoop - and I apologize if it seems long and rambling, there are a lot of things I'd like to try and fit into this, and it's difficult to arrange them all.  I just finished my first semester at a liberal arts college in the pacific northwest.  I got my grades a few days ago, and it turns out I failed my calculus class (I'm a politics and government major).  I know I got at least a C in the class itself, but my professor had a clause in her syllabus that stated ""if you do not perform up to standards on the final exam, I reserve the right to fail you.""  Well...the final ended up focusing mainly on all the things I didn't study for/had a hard time with, and I did really bad on it, thus failing the class.  In my other classes I got two A minuses and a B plus, so my GPA ended up being a 2.7 for the semester.  

  Now, going to a private liberal arts college is expensive.  I get a LOT of financial aid (merit and need based), but given that tuition is 50 grand, we end up still having to pay roughly 18 grand of it - which, given that my dad is unemployed, my mom works a blue collar job, and we're also paying for my older sister to finish school (at a REALLY expensive university, way more than mine) is kind of a lot.  I've done all the research and I meet all of the requirements to keep all of my financial aid, merit and need based - that is, that I need to have a 2.5 and complete at least 3/4 of my classes.  This guarantees that I can still attend in good standing and for the same cost as before.  Our university also has a take-over policy, which allows me to take the class again at any point in my college career and have the new grade replace the old one.  Taking all this into account, my failing this class can be remedied without any extra cost to my mother - paying for four years with this on my record will cost exactly the same if it hadn't happened, and the grade can be done away with.  I can fix it all without any harm. 

  Here lies the problem, however.  My mom already seems to consider sending me to a liberal arts college to be a waste - she constantly questions my choices of classes, stating that they sound too easy and unguided, and I should be taking 200 and 300 level classes to fulfill my core requirements AND be taking 200 and 300 level classes for my major (in my first year of college).  I've explained to her countless times that the reason I'm taking classes in various areas is due to core requirements as set forth by my university, that 200 level classes are difficult to get into due to freshmen quotas (3 per 200 level), that 300 level classes don't go towards core requirements, and that university policy states that if I take any upper level class in a specific field of study, then I cannot take any preceding classes for credit.  The reason my classes (for instance, ""postpunk music"", my freshman 2nd semester seminar) are so ""easy"" sounding is because I go to a liberal arts school.  To name a few other options: ""buddhism and beats"", ""the economics of coffee"", ""life, death, and meaning"", ""evil"", and ""Japanese aesthetics"".  Now, I think all of this makes a lot of sense.  But my mom still comments how she thinks it'd be better to just send me to the local state university and save herself the money.  I disagree with this for a number of reasons - first, the local university is terrible.  100 and 200 level classes are taught by TAs who can't speak english, most professors don't care, the classes are laughable in difficulty, it takes five years to graduate if you're lucky (meaning you take summer school every year), and they don't even have my intended major of choice (political theory, that is).  It's cheaper, sure, but the quality of education is so vastly different I think it's worth it in the long run.

  I try not to have a sense of entitlement, and I'm thankful for how hard my parents work, but I feel it would be unfair to pay over 20 grand for four years to send my older sister to a private university and then decide that I'm not worth it despite the fact that I've shown I can do the work, AND she graduates next semester, freeing up a lot of money.  I'm also trying hard to bring down the costs  - applying to be an RA to save on housing costs, and applying for numerous outside scholarships.  Anyways, the big question here is how do I convince her that 1. I should still continue to attend my university of choice despite my bad grade in calculus, and 2. that my university of choice is worth the money we pay.


tl;dr - I failed calculus due to a bad grade on the final and I can make it up with no extra cost and replace the bad grade, and I still have maintained all my scholarships - but first I need to convince my mom that it's still worth it to send me to this school.",AskReddit,"I just got my first semester college

*throwaway* And sorry if I jump around, I'm really mad/sad and need to get it out.       
    
**TL;DR I feel like my dad cares more about his siblings than his own children, I feel like he's lying to me, and he doesn't seem to care about my feelings/life.**
    
My dad had never been a huge part of my life. My mom pretty much raised my siblings and me by herself while my dad worked. That wouldn't be such a problem if my dad had attended events that were important to me: Birthday dinners, ""family nights"", etc. He could never attend those, but we *always* attended events that were important to him, even if it was extremely inconvenient to us. That had been going on my entire life. As of last year, he and my mom decided to get a divorce (they went through marriage counselling and everything).    
    
I expected it, but whatever. My dad gave old cars to his serial unemployed brother, money to my other deadbeat relatives on his side, etc. because he is practically the only one in his family that has a steady income to support a family. He and my mom have decided ""their weekends"" and when to eat dinner at my dad's house since he moved out. They were almost always inconvenient due to school and jobs and my small social life, but I usually attended if I could. He *is* my dad. Then he got worse.    
    
We're going through economic difficulties. My mom found a job about a year before the divorce, but it's only part-time because my brother is still young and needs help. The house I currently live in is too expensive, so we have to move out. My mom has a lot of job opportunities in her hometown, it's a great opportunity for me/my little sister/my brother and my older sister is fine with moving, but because it's about a 2.5hr drive away, my dad, who was pretty much absent my entire life, doesn't want us to move there. It's a great school district, I have family that I like there, I have some friends there, etc. My dad constantly tells my brother that it'd be terrible to move there, so my brother is adamant on staying in this town, even though we have to pay for him to go to private school due to education/bullying. My dad said my siblings and I can only move if my brother stays here, which is not an option for obvious reasons. Despite economic troubles, my dad (who lives with his deadbeat brother) buys aforementioned brother/my uncle cigars, cigarettes (which are $10 a pack here or something), alcohol, and pays the rent. He also bought 2 bikes for a total of $20,000, pays insurance on his *4* bikes, his car, and his deadbeat brother's bike. Oh yeah, that brother is unemployed. My dad also gave him old cars that he no longer used, and that brother gave them to his step-wife's children. They aren't even really married; it was only for legal issues.        

My dad makes a decent amount of money, but for some reason, he can't buy plane tickets for my siblings and me to visit our dying relatives, but he *can* afford for us to go on a multi-day trip with another one of his siblings in a town a few states away. He also promised me a good computer (which I'll need for school this year and for college, along for entertainment) as just a gift. Then it became a Christmas gift. Then birthday and Christmas. Then birthday, Christmas, and graduation gift. My graduation is *next* year. We ordered one, but after 3 months it was still backordered so I canceled it. He said he never got the money back yet, so he can't afford a different computer. I get straight A's in school and work really hard in hopes of getting a scholarship, so I also kind of feel like I deserve a good computer. That's only a big deal because he still buys my uncle a load of crap and I feel like he's lying to me.    
    
At first, I honestly tried to have a strong bond with him. Then I felt like he cared more about his useless, government-mooching, family-mooching brothers than he did about his own children. I still feel that way. I went to his house for dinner today, and I'll admit that I have been cold and rude to him for about a week because of how hurt I am, and a bunch of people I didn't know were there. He never told us that they were coming and he *knows* I'm an introvert, so I felt even more hurt. While they were away, he told me I was being rude, entitled, selfish, prissy, etc. That's when I just left and went home.

HepRob,1630689958,/r/college/comments/ph9qx1/how_do_engineering_students_with_no_parental/,"I'm about at the end of my rope here. 

I'm currently enrolled at Columbus State Community College. I hope to transfer to Ohio State University if/once I earn an Associate degree in pursuit of a Chemical Engineering Bachelor's degree/career. But I am not enrolled in any classes yet because I don't see how I can afford it. And again, I'm at a community college. Tuition is not the issue here. It's living expenses. I need to come up with about $1500 a month, pure cash. I wish it could be less, but I have a mother/family to support. But here's the thing, I thought that was a lot, but according to The College Board, that's ""moderate spending"" in the 2016-2017 academic year.

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-07-05/estimate-living-expenses-to-determine-college-affordability

A job could cover that, and I have one. Hence how I'm able to support my family right now. But the time a job takes prevents me from going to school. Even if I could somehow schedule my shifts so that I had time to go to class, my academic advisor explains that 1 credit hour of class comes out to 3 hours per week outside of class, studying and doing homework and the like. 

https://www.aic.edu/academics/credit-hours-calculator/

At LEAST. This is an especially hard rule for engineering students, which I am/hope to be. So going from class to work with only an hour between wouldn't leave me enough time to get my coursework done.

But there are full time engineering students. Lots of them. And they don't all come from rich families. So how are they affording their living expenses if they aren't working full time? My academic advisor didn't know. So she referred me to a financial aid advisor. She told me the financial aid advisor could advise me on the proper pursuit of full-time studenthood. 

We must not understand what a ""financial aid advisor"" does. Because this financial aid advisor was fucking useless as far as that. What she did know was how to say ""Have you accepted your reward package yet?"" I explained to her that the reward package alone isn't enough to cover school + living expenses, and I needed to know, based on her wisdom and what she's seen of other students and how this tends to work out, what the wise steps to take are if I'm looking to cover what The College Board alleges are moderately typical expenses. If these expenses are so typical, I'm assuming she as an advisor has seen many students in this situation, who need to cough up this kind of money, and did somehow cough up that kind of money. But no, she knew dick outside of what everyone already knows about the financial aid process. I know what a federal loan is, I know what its limits are. Obviously gambling on scholarships is of no use to me if I need money right now. Not in March of 2022. So she says ""Well, you could take out private loans..."" And I'm like ""Is that wise?"" And she's like ""No, no loan is wise."" So can this just not be done??? She, whose job I assumed was advising about a tenable path to paying for college, is giving me advice and then immediately following it up with ""That's bad advice by the way. I don't know what to tell you.""

The closest thing to valuable advice I could find was on Reddit. r/CSCC is a ghost town. r/OSU has mostly suggested things that only apply if I'm an actual student at Ohio State. Some have suggested part time work, but are there really jobs out there that are so part time that I can go to school full time AND do all my homework AND all of my labs/group projects AND study AND go to work? The College Board says people are doing it. But I can't find a job like that. People say ""Get a part time job as a waiter. The hours are short &amp; flexible, and the tips are plenty."" But you can't just get a job as a waiter. I've tried. It takes training before they make you a waiter and I need wait staff money now. I can't support my family without it. And that's if they even give you a chance. In Columbus especially they talk a big game about how desperate they are for wait staff &amp; other restaurant staff. But the only place that didn't turn me away because they're ""not looking to train someone new"" offered me a door job that averages only $40 in tips a night. If I worked every night I would be barely scraping half of what I need. I appreciate them being honest with me though.

I need to talk to someone who's done this. So I can follow their example. Crunch the numbers as might, it just don't add up. Everyone warns me, Chemical Engineering, or any engineering at all, is a dreadful undertaking. My academic advisor expressly warned me against pursuing an engineering degree while working full time. So where are engineering students getting money for food and rent if they're busy with schoolwork all the time??? What part time jobs are covering their living expenses? Can I have one of those jobs???

Hope is waning. I have a CLEP test coming up, but I'm losing motivation. Grip on integral calculus and logarithmic functions loosening. But if I can just find people who've pulled this off...",college,"How do engineering students with no parental contribution afford living expenses?

*throwaway* And sorry if I jump around, I'm really mad/sad and need to get it out.       
    
**TL;DR I feel like my dad cares more about his siblings than his own children, I feel like he's lying to me, and he doesn't seem to care about my feelings/life.**
    
My dad had never been a huge part of my life. My mom pretty much raised my siblings and me by herself while my dad worked. That wouldn't be such a problem if my dad had attended events that were important to me: Birthday dinners, ""family nights"", etc. He could never attend those, but we *always* attended events that were important to him, even if it was extremely inconvenient to us. That had been going on my entire life. As of last year, he and my mom decided to get a divorce (they went through marriage counselling and everything).    
    
I expected it, but whatever. My dad gave old cars to his serial unemployed brother, money to my other deadbeat relatives on his side, etc. because he is practically the only one in his family that has a steady income to support a family. He and my mom have decided ""their weekends"" and when to eat dinner at my dad's house since he moved out. They were almost always inconvenient due to school and jobs and my small social life, but I usually attended if I could. He *is* my dad. Then he got worse.    
    
We're going through economic difficulties. My mom found a job about a year before the divorce, but it's only part-time because my brother is still young and needs help. The house I currently live in is too expensive, so we have to move out. My mom has a lot of job opportunities in her hometown, it's a great opportunity for me/my little sister/my brother and my older sister is fine with moving, but because it's about a 2.5hr drive away, my dad, who was pretty much absent my entire life, doesn't want us to move there. It's a great school district, I have family that I like there, I have some friends there, etc. My dad constantly tells my brother that it'd be terrible to move there, so my brother is adamant on staying in this town, even though we have to pay for him to go to private school due to education/bullying. My dad said my siblings and I can only move if my brother stays here, which is not an option for obvious reasons. Despite economic troubles, my dad (who lives with his deadbeat brother) buys aforementioned brother/my uncle cigars, cigarettes (which are $10 a pack here or something), alcohol, and pays the rent. He also bought 2 bikes for a total of $20,000, pays insurance on his *4* bikes, his car, and his deadbeat brother's bike. Oh yeah, that brother is unemployed. My dad also gave him old cars that he no longer used, and that brother gave them to his step-wife's children. They aren't even really married; it was only for legal issues.        

My dad makes a decent amount of money, but for some reason, he can't buy plane tickets for my siblings and me to visit our dying relatives, but he *can* afford for us to go on a multi-day trip with another one of his siblings in a town a few states away. He also promised me a good computer (which I'll need for school this year and for college, along for entertainment) as just a gift. Then it became a Christmas gift. Then birthday and Christmas. Then birthday, Christmas, and graduation gift. My graduation is *next* year. We ordered one, but after 3 months it was still backordered so I canceled it. He said he never got the money back yet, so he can't afford a different computer. I get straight A's in school and work really hard in hopes of getting a scholarship, so I also kind of feel like I deserve a good computer. That's only a big deal because he still buys my uncle a load of crap and I feel like he's lying to me.    
    
At first, I honestly tried to have a strong bond with him. Then I felt like he cared more about his useless, government-mooching, family-mooching brothers than he did about his own children. I still feel that way. I went to his house for dinner today, and I'll admit that I have been cold and rude to him for about a week because of how hurt I am, and a bunch of people I didn't know were there. He never told us that they were coming and he *knows* I'm an introvert, so I felt even more hurt. While they were away, he told me I was being rude, entitled, selfish, prissy, etc. That's when I just left and went home. I'm crying right now because of how mean and detached he is from me and how little he seems to care.

FuriousPeanutButter,1600127951,/r/college/comments/isxbo8/how_my_addiction_to_video_games_destroyed_my/,"This is a post I wanted to make for a while. Not only to remind myself of my mistakes but to also help others by sharing my experience.

I'm studying computer science in a European University. And yes I know, ""video game addiction"" is kind of a lame subject but I see so many people affected by it. Especially students. So I figured my view on it might help a few people. 

I was always a gamer, spending a lot of hours in my youth years, until my parents told me that I should quit so I could get in a good school. And so I did. I quit gaming and focused on studying in my high school years. I was always one of the top students in my class and even though I had a tendency to procrastinate, I did well in every exam.

My university is public which means I don't have to pay anything and I'm also (currently) able to study there for as many years as I need to complete my studies without any consequences. While I was on my second year a few of my friends introduced me to PC gaming. So I built a gaming computer and started playing. And I was hooked. First it was PUBG. I started staying up late with friends so I could become the best. When I didn't play the game, I watched streamers for hours in order to learn how to become better and better. Then I found out about fortnite. At this point I was playing 10 hours a day and watching streams for 5 or 6 hours. I had 0 revenue out of it but I thought that as long as I was happy and becoming better at it, everything's ok.  


I was in my third year, I was failing all my classes and I was not helping my friends in our group projects. That was in my opinion, rock bottom. Not only did my parents see me wasting my life away, but I disappointed my friends as well. They didn't say anything much about it. But deep down I know they were so angry at me, and they were so right. Thankfully I'm lucky enough to still have them in my life.  


As my friends from my school started to quit gaming to focus on their studies, I started looking for new gaming friends. I met a few friends of a friend and we started playing together. Everything was fun again. Every time I had an assignment I would just open Fortnite and forget about anything else. I was ignoring my assignments, my studies, my future... on purpose.  At that time I started playing Rainbow6Siege. For those who don't know it's a game that requires knowledge on maps, strategies etc. So I had no other choice but to grind it. This went on for months.  


After a one-month trip to another country, free of games, I started wondering if me wasting the last 3 years of my life on games was worth it. I got back ready to live life. I quit gaming. For a month. Then I started playing again. My addiction grew and it was being fed from my pour choices. Every time I was worried about my life or my studies I just launched a game and forgot about them. When lockdown came some of my friends were begging me to stop playing and to start studying instead. ""This is your chance to make up for the last years."". Nope. I played probably 16 hours a day.  


After my latest failure in the recent exams + the fact that I got bored after having more than 4000 hours in games, I quit. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't always in my house. I was going out, drinking coffee or alcohol and had a good social life. That didn't change the fact that when I was home(most of the time), I was gaming.  


I know some of you reading this are probably thinking that this is pathetic, and it is. But I know there are people out there struggling with the same problem. Making them depressed, making them fail, making them waist their time in the sake of having fun. I'm talking to you now guys.   


* Start going to the gym. It will help you let off steam and help you relax. Competitive gaming does the complete opposite. I remember arguing with my parents because I was angry at my teammates, the game, or something else. It's not worth it. 
* Go on a trip. I would suggest going alone. If you can't do that, grab a bunch of friends and go. The longer, the better. Try to appreciate life. Try to find yourself again outside of games. 
* It's pretty obvious but... uninstall every game in your computer. Yes. Minesweeper is considered a game too.

During the last 4 years I was so frustrated when I watched youtube videos saying ""How to be productive 24/7"", ""How gaming destroyed my life"". So I get that this post might feel annoying to some of you. But if you've made it to here I know that you see my point. And hopefully you'll consider it. I don't want you guys to be productive/to make money/to finish your studies, I couldn't care less, I just want you to reconsider if it's worth spending so much time (and money) into it.",college,How my addiction to video games destroyed my studies.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/isxbo8/how_my_addiction_to_video_games_destroyed_my/,1600149551.0,can't pay for school,6.033333333333333
[deleted],1294049885,/r/AskReddit/comments/evcrw/due_to_wikileaks_and_the_past_couple_years_of/,"So I'm reading some wikileaks cables, obviously some regarding my own government here in America.. and I lose it. I've been paying close attention to all the.. BULL SHIT.. that goes on in our society and I broke down and started crying in front of a random fuck-buddy girl. I immediately start thinking what I need to do to make a difference somewhere and how, and the first thought that pops in to my head is the Peace Corps. So I go to their website in an attempt to contact somebody and tell them that, I.Need.To.Go. I need to go help feed the starving, I need to go educate humans, I need to provide ideas to better the efficiency of their society.. and I type up this letter in an attempt to convince some random fuck that they should let me do something of importance despite me not having obtained a BA or equivalent:

I'm a 23 year old male living in Northern California. I've completed nearly all of my general education requirements and have done little study deeper as a political science and digital arts major. For the past few years I've been disregarding the school system I've been offered as it is A) Becoming far too expensive and I simply do not have the means or the will to want to acquire the means and attend school full time...and that being because of B) The declining importance of a degree in todays society. Too many of my friends and acquaintances have spent the past four+ years studying something that they're not even in the working field of, so it's hard to imagine they're making a contribution to the good of society. As I was saying about the past few years, I've began to dive deeper in to what makes our society tick, and what bugs it has. Unfortunately there's so many bugs, every things an absolute shit-storm. So where do you begin? Well, like any building of any kind, you start from the bottom, which in our case is obviously the third world and somewhere other than America. To put it metaphorically, I see far many other countries as the crack-baby from a drug-abusing mother who died during birth and had no father figure; where as America is the rich-kid who got everything he wanted but wasn't satisfied and has all kinds of emotional and psychological problems. So basically... There are problems elsewhere that can be solved with a little mind-power and a lot of labor, compared to the deep corruption shit happening here where we are.

**Then I stop.**
And start thinking hold on, I need to see what the fuck this Peace Corps is all about.. I did some research on them when I turned 18 but I didn't know anything important that I know now.. and gee whiz, the first thing I notice is the .gov. So I dive deeper in to their website and come up with the following notes.. like their mission statements:
1. Helping the people of interested countries in meeting their need for trained men and women.
   2. Helping promote a better understanding of Americans on the part of the peoples served.
   3. Helping promote a better understanding of other peoples on the part of Americans.

Like their Budgets:
Budget

Fiscal year 2010 budget:
    $400 million
Fiscal year 2011 budget:
    $400 million*

...And their policies which were last updated Sep 30 2008. 

I immediately start searching other resources for my decided venture for action and come across the CCS-Cross-Cultural-Solutions, which costs a fee and goes for a further shortened amount of time (maximum 12 weeks).

Here's where you come in. You help me decide what I should do. The peace corps seems decently legit, one of the few legit uses of Americans tax money. I'm not too fond of the fact that its government operated but obviously I'm in a time of sacrifice to make something happen. If you could provide other ways for me to carry out this goal than the listed two I would greatly appreciate. Things to consider, I'm a broke intellectual who does NOT come from a family of means, nor a family looking to provide any means. So the CCS is looking a little tough, and I don't think I want to only help out for 12-weeks anyway. 

We need to start making shit happen somewhere, otherwise, what the fuck did we do besides work toward some bull shit like customer service or crunch and file some bills for some corporation? To those of you that worked your ass off to be able to do relevant things for our society, thank you. 

TL;DR I need to start helping the bottom of society while getting out of America.

**EDIT 1**
So I'm a little bit over my rage I was in earlier but still have the same goals in mind. Thanks to a comment I've come across the sites  http://www.voluntourism.org/ http://www.workaway.info/ and http://www.wwoof.org/.. alongside the respective peace corps and CCS sites. Any more knowledge on any of these would be great. Thanks.

**EDIT 2**
The previous three mentioned links seem to be more for the traveler looking to volunteer while on vacation. Peace Corps seemed to be more of a military entry, and CCS is kind of like a bootcamp a parents going to send their kid to.

Dorocello,1646481141,/r/college/comments/t77wl5/i_have_to_make_a_very_important_life_decision/,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well, I don't know where to post this so I'm posting it here. In a few days, I have to make a very important decision regarding higher education which will directly affect the next 10 years of my life and I wanted to ask for advice from someone who has been in the real world. I will try to be as detailed as possible, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

First and foremost, I live in the middle east, so life here is a bit different from western and eastern countries. I studied mechanical engineering in high school and I was really good at it. Upon graduating I was encouraged to enroll in a 2-year community college for a practical engineering degree. I am now 19 and almost done with my first year and I didn't like it very much because I realized that it isn't what I wanted to do. I graduated on an honors roll and know that I can do more with my life than an associate's degree. I tried to transfer to a different major but got rejected multiple times. In a few days, I will have to decide if I will continue to the second year of a degree or drop out and go to the military for 3 years. My family and teachers want me to stay but I don't know that I don't want to do this profession for the rest of my life. There will be massive consequences to this decision for there are pros and cons to getting this degree:

The pros of getting the degree:

1) As a practical engineer I will earn a higher salary in the military and will be able to save most of it because I don't need to pay for food and housing. After my service, I will be able to afford to study in a good university without getting into debt (hopefully) or even studying abroad and getting citizenship in a different country which I might do in the future.

2) Because of the saved money I won't need to work (or at least work as much) meaningless college jobs like fast food or retail while studying to earn money and can focus fully on my education.

3) If I will end up having a change of heart and decide to major in this specific field, I will be able to shorten my higher education by a year, and with possible scholarships, reduce my expenses even further. In addition, the work experience in the military will help me stand out in the job market, but currently, this is the least of my concerns.

The cons of getting the degree:

1) If I finish the degree I will need to serve an additional 1.5 years in the military. This is a problem because I won't be able to leave. Most people end up doing something they dislike in there, and if that's the case I will be doing it for longer. In addition to this, I'm afraid that I will be finishing the degree and working purely for the money, and I know how soul-sucking and miserable these jobs can be.

2) When I'm going to finish my service I will likely be 24 by then. Even in my country, most people get a bachelor's at 24-25, I will get it at 28 if I go immediately after I finish serving which makes me feel behind in life, especially to the average person who has gotten their degree at 22. I will be spending most of my 20s in academia and the military which doesn't give me a lot of spare time due to opportunity costs.

3) On its own the practical engineering degree isn't worth much even with the work experience, especially the mechanical engineering one which encourages those who have it to go to university regardless. Because I will most likely end up majoring in a different field, I feel like all of those extra years spent would be wasted for nothing.

4) This is my personal problem. Getting an associate's degree in my country is only good for those who can't or don't want to get a bachelor's for academic reasons (or those who want a mundane government job). Most of my class is filled with underachievers and the material is taught accordingly. I barely managed to get through the first year due to the absolute boredom and thought that I was wasting my life. This damages my straight-A student ego knowing that I could leave this place and go to a normal college to get a more valuable degree that would make me more money in the future like EE or CS, but the thought of getting into debt and working overtime while studying already challenging curriculum doesn't bring me comfort either.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude: I am still not sure what I want to do in the future but I won't have a lot of money to spare. In addition, I keep reading online that mechanical engineering is a dead-end field with few opportunities and that all capable people should go into tech. I also keep reading that you should be doing something that you're good at even if you don't like it instead of following your passion.

G0VERNMENTCHEESE,1341602951,/r/AskReddit/comments/w5692/anyone_here_who_moved_out_and_started_living_on/,"Backstory:

I'm 24 now and still have a bunch of classes to take until I can achieve my bachelors of comp sci. degree, but my parents have been nagging me to get a better job and to start paying 'part' of their bills. I've graduated with an associates in I.T, but I've been applying for jobs way before graduation and I still haven't had any luck. I currently work in retail and have been for 2.5 years and I went from a $8 to a $10 raise for all the hard work in sales at the beginning of this year (yeah it's not much). But lately they've been cutting everyone's hours from 40 down to 5-10 hrs per week. Already talked to the manager about this situation and he said it was corporate's decision on the budget cuts.

Anyway, my parents want me to shell out at least $800 a month to help pay for the house ALONE. Monthly mortgage is $3500 and my parents and aunt share the payment. $800 is way too much but they aren't budging for it and I might as well find an apartment of my own for that price. On top of that... electricity bills, my part of the cellphone bill, utility, etc. So that's a little over $1000 a month. They've only been giving me work 5-10 hours a week. Mind you, my aunt's 4 kids uses the most electricity and utility usage (all of them still in the first 2 years of college) and I'm either working and/or at school so I only have a few hours to use the electricity before going to bed when I get back at home at 1am. I'd also like to point out that I'm a full service maid here and my folks appreciate it, but my cousins don't do shit around the house. You can come by and see my aunt always yelling at them to get a job like me while going to school. So I'm kind of wondering WHY I'm the one that has to pay the full amount for the bills when my cousins obviously play a role in the bills price too... my parents response? ""Well you're older than them and you have a job"". What a joke... I only use the electricity to use the computer and watch TV which is no more than 150W (according to my Kill-A-Watt meter). Did I also mention I also have to pay that $40 internet bill that everyone here uses?

So I'm getting fed up with this and their nagging. I can't convince them anymore and haven't been able to for the past 3-4 years with this problem. My parents don't seem to understand how balance works with the bills. I mean if it were around $200 a month with my situation I can do that, but I'd hardly have any money to pay off my tuition. FAFSA says my parents make too much money. On top of that, they're paying for my brothers college education too at a private school (which I believe he has already taken out $60K in loans). The only thing I fear is having to work 2 jobs to live on my own and not being able to go back to school. I live in Northern California and the prices for rent here fluctuates.

Roommates aren't an option either... I have had problems before when hanging out with other people during a weekend vacation.

I'm at a lost here. Right now I can either just drop out of school (which I really don't want to do) and find a second job, or try and find some kind of full-time mailman or UPS work while taking 2 classes at a time each semester. I've been having trouble sleeping at night just thinking about this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TL, DR:

- I'm 24 and still live at my parents house and trying to finish school

- They want me to shell out at least $1000+ per month for all kinds of expenses, but retail work for me has gone from 40hrs down to 5-10 per week

- 4 cousins living here (in college as well) play a major part in the utility and electricity bills, but parents say I should pay for the full price of EVERY bill, yet FAFSA caters to them.

- Little brother (in a private college) has taken out $70K in loans so far in his 2nd year and my parents are helping pay for his expenses including HIS housing... forgot to mention that me and my folks tried really hard convincing him not go to to private college since it's very expensive but he made suicidal threats so my folks had to give in

- I work for my own money to pay for my own tuition and FAFSA doesn't give a shit about me because my parents make too much money


For $1000 a month, I could very well find my own place and live peacefully without any kind of ratchet (hopefully) and leave my parents and aunt to sort out their own kinds of dysfunctional problems. House is usually messy when me, my parents, and aunt aren't there. 

I'd also like to say that I don't want to be limited to only living in California. Going out of state would be great... I've always thought about living around Seattle, Washington or some parts of Canada.

spoodydoo,1636225309,/r/college/comments/qo6vdw/should_i_try_to_withdraw_from_this_class_or_push/,"So I’m pulling a C (75) in an Intro to PR course right now that is online asynchronous, or basically a “no class meetings, here’s the work, get it done” class. I’m taking four four-credit courses right now (16 credits) and one zero-credit course that’s needed for my degree, so technically 5 classes but 16 credits.

Now, 3/5 of those classes are online asynchronous, including the PR course that I’m struggling in. The difference is that with the other 2 asynchronous classes, the teachers always reach out and email their students weekly, announce their office hours, give multiple extra-credit opportunities, etcetera. The way the assignments are set up is clear-cut and explained thoroughly to where I always am able to understand what I’m being asked to do, and if not then my questions get cleared up through an email to the professor(s). Therefore, aside from that one PR class, my lowest grade currently otherwise is a 97. 

Now, with the PR course, I’m not at all familiar with the subject or the material, but every assignment the professor gives makes it seem as though the professor almost *expects* us to know exactly what to do every time (she has 20+ years of professional experience in the PR field, after all). I’ve tried to read the chapters but again, it’s like the book expects you to already be familiar with its topics. I can read a chapter multiple times from the readings and *still* not understand what I’m being asked to do for the assignments; I just go off of what the book shows me, but I don’t really retain any of the information afterwards. 

I’ve already met on Zoom with this teacher. She’s very nice and has been very accommodating in situations where I’ve needed assistance (such as not getting access to the book on-time, and giving me extra time to do assignments and not even counting them late). She means well, I’m sure, but I don’t think an online asynchronous format works well with the class or the way she teaches it. Plus, she teaches at a different university and has a 1-star rating with that university, and is apparently notorious for being nitpicky with grading and takes *forever* to grade assignments, so you never really know what your grade is (ex. I’ve handed in 5 assignments for her class this semester, and only gotten a grade on the *first one* that I handed in *2 months ago*). I don’t want to disappoint her, but I don’t think I’m the right fit with her teaching format. 

The fact that I can’t wrap my head around the material and how it’s being delivered is starting to burn me out with this class, and I’m considering withdrawing and retaking it in a future semester in a face-to-face format, as the class is a major component of my degree. There’s a teacher I have another online class with (and an A in) that will be teaching Intro to PR on-campus next semester, so if I could get in a class with her with a different teaching method, I think it would really benefit me. 

The 60% completion of the term is marked as being November 7th, the day my PR midterm is due. The deadline at my college to withdraw from full-term courses with a W on your transcript is the 15th, so I’m thinking of half-assedly completing the midterm, handing it in, then going to campus on the 8th or 9th and seeing if I can withdraw and retake the course face-to-face at a later date. 

Withdrawing will put me at 12 credits (from 16 attempted) which is still full-time status, so I have no idea if any aid would be affected. If I were to stick it out and try to pass the class, I would need a C *minimum*, so anything lower and I’d have to retake it anyway, plus with a major kick in the groin to my GPA. 

My questions are: 
1. Should I even do the PR midterm? 
2. Should I try to withdraw and retake the course later, or should I try to pass it and risk failing? 

I’m already 2 assignments behind in PR, too. My major worry with withdrawing from that one class is that I’d owe the school money from the financial aid that paid for it (which I don’t have). My school does flat-rate tuition though for 12-20 credits I think, so would it matter? If there’s no academic or financial consequences to withdrawing then I will literally leap to the opportunity. 

From college-student to college-students, any advice?

TL;DR: A class that is a core requirement for my degree is being taken online asynchronously, and I’m really struggling with it. Minimum grade needed to pass is a C, which I currently *just barely* have, and I’m feeling burnt out from doing a bunch of assignments *hoping* that I’m doing them correctly. I have A’s in all of my other classes. Withdrawing would take me from 16 credits down to 12, so I’d still be considered full-time. Not passing the class would be a big hit to my GPA. Either way, I’d likely have to retake the class again, and I think face-to-face for this class specifically would be better for me. I’m just worried that financial aid may be affected, or that the school would want their money back or something.

VeraMar,1526068284,/r/college/comments/8iqn6t/how_to_choose_the_college_thats_best_for_you/,"I’d like to provide some brief context as to why I am and why I’m making this post. I’m a college grad (University of Arizona, B.S. in Microbiology), and I’m starting my Masters program soon. My wife and I were recently talking about our college experiences and comparing them to our colleagues/friends who graduated from other states with similar degrees, some of which attained their degrees from highly ranked programs or Ivy League schools. What is the difference between prestigious schools, state schools, and even community colleges? Should we have gotten Ivy League educations instead of our state school educations? I want to share the conclusions of our conversation in hopes that it might help prospective students choose an appropriate school. Based off of our conversation, we thought more expensive or higher ranked schools would potentially have better student resources, more proficient professors, more prestige associated with the attained degree, and stronger likelihood of networking with important people. 

The term “student resources” encompasses so much. It can include anything from counseling services, to types of gyms/recreational area that are available, to the kinds of clubs on campus. Every school wants you to succeed, but having more resources available to you can make it a much easier process. If you find yourself struggling with classes (either emotionally or academically), a school with better on campus health clinics and tutoring services can give you that extra push to do well. Some of you may also be considering professional schools or graduate programs, in which case a strong student services office that can review your applications and professional statements would be incredibly helpful. These are just some examples to name a few. 

If you are not already aware, many universities do research. They want to academic literature to come from their school, but in order to do that they need to bring in individuals to do research and publish said results. These people will often have PhDs (doctorate degrees in a particular area of research), and along with research they also teach students. As such it is not difficult to see how a more wealthy school can bring in professors who may be leading experts in their field. By having them teach the students, they will likely churn out a highly capable student body, and having high scores would reflect well on that school and their corresponding programs. This is great news for students who are interested in getting into research - or even those looking to apply for professional school such as MD/DO - because you will have the chance to work under a professor and help them with their work. 

Then there’s prestige. I haven’t looked this up myself, but I would not doubt there is some correlation between finding a good job and coming from a good school. Whether we like it or not, having the name of a highly ranked school on your resume or CV will definitely raise eyebrows and make you stand out. This can certainly work in your favor of securing a good job after you graduate. 

Lastly, there’s networking. This is really a combination of all the above. As I’ve previously mentioned, having more money available at the school means they’re more capable of hiring very qualified and/or very well-known people for their positions. If you as a student can work under people who have a great reputation in their field, then having them as a reference can give you a significant advantage in the workforce. This applies for just about anyone, whether you’re looking to do research, or if you’re looking to become the next CEO of a big company. Surrounding yourself with people of good reputation can only help you. 

With that being said, going to a prestigious school does not guarantee that you will do well, nor does it mean you will find a great job. Conversely, there have been many successful people that come from “just” state schools. What I recommend is taking a backwards approach to applying to schools or accepting invitations. Start with the career you want to want to aim for, then list the criteria necessary for it. (e.g. if you’re looking to go into an MD program in the future, it would be wise you choose a school where you can do research, is known for their science courses, has good MCAT prep courses, and has good counselors which can help you revise your application). Don’t quite know where you want to end up? That’s fine! Then maybe you should choose a school that is well-rounded and has a good foundation of student counselors that will help guide you. Google is seriously your best friend when doing this sort of research. The more research you do beforehand about what you want/expect out of your education, the easier it’ll be to choose the school that is right for you. Who knows, maybe the school that’s better suited for someone isn’t that very expensive Ivy League school, but rather their local state school! Both my wife and I were incredibly happy about the education we got at the UofA and wouldn’t change it if we had the chance.

out_of_options91,1312326135,/r/AskReddit/comments/j75u1/reddit_im_gay_but_should_i_let_my_parents_try_and/,"Hi Reddit, I'm a seemingly normal (or so I believe) gay third year college student who has been hiding my sexuality from my parents for about a decade. Last month, my life (and my parent's) turned upside down when my mom discovered some gay magazines in my backpack. Needless to say, my mom didn't take it well. The next morning, I awoke to my dad screaming insulting names at me and storming out of the house with my laptop, and phone, among other belongings. Apparently, my mom told my dad.

After reading my texts and discovering I had a boyfriend, they told me that I was dead to them and that they would no longer be supporting me unless I could convince them I would not be gay anymore, cut off all ties to my boyfriend, get a job, let them live with me at college, and give them access to my school account, email, bank accounts, phone, and laptop.

I'm at a loss as to how I can convince my parents that I will be straight for life without them constantly looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life making sure that I don't do anything gay. When I asked for clarification as to what they want, they admitted that they don't know what they are looking for. I gave them access to my school account to show that my academic future is still bright (B+ average at a top 50 engineering university), but after criticizing my grades, I was left empty handed. They also explained that sending me to college is difficult because of the trust issues, but if they move up with me, I don't see how I could live with them acting the way they are and still do well at school. I have tried reassuring them that I'm still thier son, that I can still have a future if they let me, but they are already convinced that I'm ""brainwashed"", that I'm a different person who is destined for failure unless I turn straight. I can see how they might consider this control as a form of helping me, but thier emotions and lack of respect for me are getting in the way of any reasonable conversation to the point that they don't accept anything I'm saying. I'm afraid that trying to sway my parents view that homosexuality is a choice is a lost cause and going to college seems a long shot as they have simply been asking for more and more from me in order to attend college.

From what I understand, my parents are hurt that I've lied about my sexuality, that I lied about going to visit friends when I was actually visiting my boyfriend, and that I was ""pushing them away"" by not visiting them as often as my boyfriend. But from my position, I felt forced to lied because I predicted that coming out in such a conservative environment would cause trauma and rejection and the results have been worse than I had feared. I have also tried to address their concerns about not being accepted in society, about having children via artificial insemination, and even the health risks, but nothing seems to help. It's been a month, and I've still gained no trust; I only received a violation of my privacy and the destruction of my relationships.

Time is running out for me and my options are becoming more limited. The deadline for financial aid has already passed and I have to decide whether or not to stay by early September. Financially, it's easier for me to stay and just let my parents torture me for two to three years, but I don't think I could handle being forced back into the closet and beaten with a stick until my parents are satisfied that my homosexuality is ""gone"". If I leave I would have to live with my boyfriend, withdraw from school to work a job to finance myself, and perhaps even transfer institutions, all of which I'm willing, yet reluctant to do. I'm also concerned that leaving might cause my parents to do something rash in thier highly emotional state.

I recognize that I am not entitled to anything from my parents; they can choose where they spend their money. I just don't know if my parents' expectation of overbearing control is ridiculous or if I'm the one being ridiculous with these thoughts of running away. However, with my education and mental stability at risk, I don't see many other options but to leave. My question is, do I lie about who I am, giving my parents false hope and let them control my life to try to make me straight? Do I leave home with close to nothing and try to support myself through school? Or is there some other option I'm perhaps missing?


TL;DR Parents found out I was gay, rejected me (I'm dead to them) and explained that they would not support me unless I could convince them I was straight, cut off all ties to my boyfriend, get a job, let them live with me at school, and give them access to my school account, email, bank accounts, phone, and laptop.

Tiziic,1483130966,/r/college/comments/5l5q3v/parents_want_me_to_finish_my_computer_science/,"Hey guys, I need some advice. I'm in a pretty shitty situation, and I'm completely lost in where to turn and what to do. 

So I'm 20 years old. Should be a Junior at my university, but still classified as a Sophomore because of some failed courses. Freshman year, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I didn't exactly have a passion for anything, and wasn't sure where I wanted to go in life. I did however, love using my computer, and when I researched Computer Science, the idea of being able to code and create things from nothing using a computer grabbed my attention. Plus, the pay in the field was something I felt my parents would be proud of, so I decided at the end of Freshman year that I'd major in Computer Science. 

Come Sophomore year, I started taking some of the required MATH and GEEN courses for the major, and while the information I learned from the GEEN courses interested me enough to look into it, I hated MATH. I've always hated math, whether because I never got a proper understanding of it while I was younger, or I'm just not a mathy type of person, I struggle with it. I failed Calculus I at the end of Sophomore year, and retook it again this semester (what should be me first semester as a Junior) but failed it again. I also failed GEEN 165 for the second time, the second required course for CS. 

A few things happened between Sophomore year that threw me into a depression that didn't involve school, but ultimately made me reevaluate my life and where I wanted to be. I knew I wasn't happy with the person I was, and I wanted to improve and grow. I came out with the dream goal that I've always had since I was little, wanting to understand people. How they think, why they behave the way they do, and help/heal them in order to allow them to understand and find themselves. Turns out, this is the blueprint of Psychology. Over the summer of Sophomore year, I really delved into the study of Psychology and turns out I fucking love it. I finally felt like I understand a little of what I want to be, and had the first step to developing my life plan. 

My third year came, and as I said, I failed Calculus I and GEEN 165 for the second time, but by that time, I had concluded that CS was not for me, and I wanted to look into changing my major to Psychology. I talked it over with my parents, and at first they were surprisingly supportive. My advisor tried to recommend maybe I try IT since I wasn't too good with math, and not abandon the Technology field all together, but was also ultimately supportive. However, over the past few weeks, my parents have been pressuring me more and more to just finish up with CS, or something else Technology based in order to get my degree on time. Suggesting that I could go back to school and get my Psychology degree later. 

This sudden change in heart hurt me, as in the beginning, they were supportive of my change. It wasn't easy for me to come to them and say I wanted to change direction so close to my fourth and final year of school, and they made me feel so much better about my choice when they were there to lend a hand. Now it feels like the pressure got to them, and they're backing out. 

The catch with this situation I'm in, is I'm in school under my mothers GI Bill, so my four years of school are paid for by the military. On my mothers side, she says she doesn't want me to have to amass debt and deal with that stress. Whereas my father states that my mother is paying for her school out of pocket while using her GI on me, and changing majors all of a sudden and possibly not graduating on time would be a like a slap to the face towards her. 

I'm aware that while I've found what makes me happy, changing majors so late would keep me in school at LEAST an extra year that we'd have to pay for. I understand that getting my degree is ultimately what they want, but I can't help but know that I love isn't in technology. It's an interest at the most, but not something I'd dedicate my life to, and I'm afraid that the lack of passion would only drive me lower in terms of grades as I'm majoring in something I don't like. My Advisor suggests IT, my parents suggest Management Information Systems as it isn't as taxing on math, yet all I can think about is doing Psychology. 

What should I do? 

TL;DR: Declared computer science major wants to switch to Psychology his third year of university. School is paid for, for four years under mother's GI Bill, and parents want me to graduate on time with a degree in order to avoid having to take out loans and pay debt. They suggest an easy transition into IT or Management Information Systems and don't want me to pursue Psychology for now as I'll be in school a little longer.

CapriciousSalmon,1531794773,/r/college/comments/8zhbz6/an_important_lesson_for_all_incoming_freshmen_on/,"To all of you coming to college in the fall with the intention of living here, I’m sure you’re all excited. You get freedom, and a chance at adulthood. 

This summer, I’ve had the chance to have a trial college run in my new college based upon this state run program, courtesy of New Jersey. So far, I’ve learned how to make my bed, how to make a paper, and how to poop.

When you’re at home, you tend to poop freely. At school you tend to stop, because it’s disgusting and people tend to be dirty pigs. From experience, I never went in a public bathroom at school. I just used the English Department’s bathroom, because I was really close with them and the VP didn’t care if a student asked. But most of the time, I would only go in the morning, when I first woke up, and then once I got home at 5. But that was still bad. You might live at college from August to Thanksgiving. Or you might stay during the week and go home on the weekends on laundry. Regardless, that’s five days. You should get used to it. 

My first week at college was hard, and pun intended. But I found ways around it.

There’s some things you should do:

1. Poop alone. Sometimes you won’t feel as self conscious if you have an audience. You should try to go during times when not a lot of people have breaks, like at night when everybody is partying or during class times. Say everybody on your phone has an 8 AM class, go then. Put on music or a tv show if you have to, so you forget you’re not in a communal bathroom. Don’t worry. They get cleaned on the reg, and everybody understands to clean up after them self. Only, the ones in the classrooms might not, especially if you take summer courses where 100 kids out of a 2,000 school are taking classes. My school rented out space to a day camp with the YMCA, like the pool and a science lab, so the bathrooms in one building did look like toddlers had been through it. Don’t worry though, as they aren’t usually like that. There will be that occasional person who doesn’t flush, but it’s really far between.

2. Drink a lot of soda/Gatorade/energy drinks. I’m not joking. That’s how I got me to poop. Took me days to do. At the designated mealtimes, I would drink regular Pepsi (were a Pepsi school sorry) and then at night during study hall, run to poop. Just be warned, if you drink too much, it turns your poop moss green and stinky. Try a cup or two, not the entire bottle day after day. Also, soda at college is expensive. A bottle in the vending machine, for me, was two dollars, while it was free in the mess hall (and you get unlimited drinks) and one dollar at the Rite Aid by my house. Also, for girls, be warned that those girly things are expensive. It was two dollars for a regular tampon. Bring your own. Campus might seem like a bubble, especially in rural or suburban areas, but they have ways around it.

3. Poop when you have to. From experience, I can tell you that if you let it accumulate and just wait until class ends, you’ll end up taking fifteen minutes, sitting on the toilet, sweating and in pain. The reason? I always thought I would miss something so I would stay in class and wait until I got back to my dorm. While I still tend to do it, I try my hardest to stop.

4. Poop after you eat. While it might seem like you’re a bulimic, it works. At home, I would always poop after I had a big meal, as it emptied me out and made more room. College isn’t like high school: if you have to use the bathroom, just leave. Most professors don’t care if you’re out for 15 minutes, as it might be a hike (for me it was) or you might be constipated or whatnot. Just don’t miss the entire lesson. If you just had lunch and now have to take English 101, wait for the teacher to give directions and then go. Just, don’t miss the whole lesson, or don’t poop if it’s a difficult class, like a remedial math or a chemistry course for an English major. You could end up missing something important. I always try to go after I finish my work, like after a test.

5. Try to eat poop foods. In addition to soda, there’s other things you can try: oatmeal, beans, broccoli, nuts, berries, tacos, apples, popcorn. It might depend on your cafeteria though. My school is small, so we only have one, and it’s usually only a few foods. However, we are allowed to order out. Know that college towns tend to have a lot of foods, like Chipotle, Taco Bell, etc. many of which are rich in poop foods.

[deleted],1338491317,/r/AskReddit/comments/ueb27/i_am_20_work_55_hrswk_fulltime_student_and/,"I am 20 years old, work a sales job earning 12.50 an hour, go to school full time thanks to financial aid, and support my unemployed immigrant mother who is 43. Where lies the problem you ask? I am bound to lose my job any day, as the industry I work in is limited as far as sales and lead generating, I was suspended for a year from school due to dropping a class 2 semesters in a row, while working 2 jobs to get by, and now my mother, without notice, well a 24 hr notice, has decided to pack her shit, after me supporting her for the past 4 years, and move out of state, leaving me to find a new place to live within 3 weeks ( when our lease is up), with no credit, or money for first last and security, and having to move everything with my 2door coupe vehicle, and is expecting me to be sending her 500 dollars every month for her expenses where she is going, on top of what I will be paying for to live on my own.

Dont support her you say: I come from a middle eastern background. She can do whatever she wants, however if I turned my back on her, my whole family would disown me. 

Why dont they help you say: They can barely get by themselves.

Get another job you say: I work monday through friday 8:30 am- 6:30 pm but most days later, like around 9 or so. Any job I have applied for, has either not replied, or turned out to be a scam. 

I know this will most likely get lost in the unknown world of Reddit, But at least I tried. 

Who is John Gault? right? 

Update: 

The reason my mother is unemployed: She has a very heavy accent, and although she has a degree in hotel and tourism with a masters in Accounting, no one will give her the chance of day. Its not necessarily optional, she has probably gone to more than 500 job interviews and even worked with a career placement agency.

What is the 500$ for: the credit card bills she has accumulated through the years of unemployment to help us out with the bills and expenses. Also for rent while she is out of state.

Reason she went out of state: to possibly find a job.

Why speaking to my family does not help: My grandparent's solution is for her to go back home which a.) she refuses, and b.) the plane ticket home is $1800 that I don't have and they can't pay for, and in order for her to be able to ever come back to the USA we have to go to NY and do our citizenship stuff which is $600 per person not including the fare up there and also room and board for the 5 days we have to be there. However if she was willing and could manage to get there, my Grandparents would take care of her and house her until she found a job, which would be much easier since she is native to the country

Is my family crazy: for the most part yes. My grandparents are conservative muslims in their 70's and 80's. I am pretty much the only grandchild, of around 30 or so grandkids that has made ANYTHING of themselves. Some are in the progress of cleaning up there lives while others have moved away and disconnected from the family and fucked their parents over. 

p.s. I am a girl, in case you were wondering. 

Update 7/25/12
She moved out of state. I moved out of the house, and since I couldnt find a place in time I moved in with my boyfriend with the idea that I will keep on searching while saving up some money to move in to my own place. So far since her departure in early June, I have sent her around $1500 which I Could kind of sort of afford since I dont have to pay rent. Fast forward to last nigh. She calls me asking for more money. Another 300 dollars on top of the 250 I sent her 2 days ago which is not calculated in the 1500. I say "" we'll see"" and hang up. Write a long email explaining how her actions have ruined my 1 year relationship, with the money, the being forced to move in together, with me feeling obligated to take care of her and my boyfriend disagreeing with that ideology. Side note, she got a job a week into being there, and got fired a week later and is now once again unemployed. Back to last night: i tell her how I cannot afford my own place while sending her all this money. Nor can I continue living with my BF because our relationship has gone down the shitter due to all this stress. Conclusion: I tell her  the $250 is the last money I am sending her, and to not call me until something changes all Via Email. While at work, receive a reply: I understand, Dont call me until you decide you want to be my daughter again. Result, I burst into tears, and feel like shit.

I made absolutely no use of the resources available, had no idea where to look for help or even ask questions, I felt like completely lost and ashamed in front of my peers with my situation.  Looking back, I was a fool and hated myself for it.  I worked overnight shifts and weekends at the hospital, scheduled my classes early in the morning so i can go straight to class after work, getting paid 10/hr, you can imagine how it was to pay for 3-4k tuition a semester.  My schedule would often look like this: 10pm-8am (work) 8:30-noon (class).  It was exhausting, I studied on the job, on the bus, between classes, during lunch, on the toilet, literally anywhere, just to get by with a 2.4.  Pretty sad, I know.

I graduated and working now at a dead-end job that pays 9/hr, even worse than when I had no degree.  Doing everything I can, volunteering, researching, everything and anything to hope for a chance that some school would look pass my horrid GPA and a somewhat irrelevant degree.  My GPA is too low to even apply to any postbacc, masters, certificates.  Some have suggested that I do some DIY classes at a nearby school to raise my GPA, but that would require me to be a non-degree seeking student, which would rule out financial aid, I can't afford tuition with my job and even if i could, that would be making the same mistake all over again.

Not necessarily proud of this but I was petrified to get a suspension.

I played football (soccer) in year 12 for my High School, as I did every year as well as for a recreational club (not playing any more). One particular game we had was against one of the more prestigious schools located within our general area and was well known for being an expensive high school with a knack for enticing students to play sports for them with scholarships. Fair enough; schools do this!

Throughout the second half of the Football game, as I play Striker, I was marked by this one player from the opposition team. He was fairly average though did tend to stay on me for the most part. I guess he got annoyed that I was making him work a bit harder than usual, as I would always slip past him when on my attacking runs. He became more vocal and physical with his disdain for me, telling me to ""fuck off"" in almost every sentence he addressed me with and also grabbing at me, pulling at my arm, pushing me in the back, etc. I was fairly used to this so I paid it no mention, though it did get on my nerves.

Our team was in no way full of scholarship players and despite our amicable efforts, we lost. As per usual, we end our game with an obligatory handshake. Something clicked in my mind and I had suddenly built up an unmistakeable hating for this guy and wanted to get back at him for all of his bullshit during the match. I had felt cheated that I didn't get to do much except have to deal with his nonsense; I didn't score a goal so I felt pretty useless.

As we went to handshake, the smug look on his face got the better of me. I pulled my hand up to my face and tried to spit in it, but my mouth was very dry and I only managed to blow air and a dabble of saliva into it. He obviously saw this and slapped me across the face, catching me off guard and throwing me to the ground. (A slap not a punch and I wasn't expecting it, strangely!)

From this point on, everyone starts running onto the field. Players from my team come in to back me up, players from his team run on, the referee runs on to break things up. Everyone keeps asking me what's going on and I just sit there holding my face. I get pulled away by my father and we go home.

The following week was completely guilt ridden for me. For the first time in my life, I felt as though my friends were genuinely on my side, which crushed me because of my deceitful behaviour. People were giving me words of support:

""Don't worry, Twin, he was a douchebag!"" ""We'll beat the shit out of him!"" Yada yada yada.

I felt extremely unwell whenever someone mentioned it to me and tried my best to just shrug it off and tell everyone to stop talking about it.

What made it worse was that the whole incident was now under investigation from the head of my sports department. Let's call him Mr. Footy. Mr. Footy has never liked me for who knows what reason. I've been relatively well behaved in the past and never so much as mustered more than a lunch time detention. I kept getting sent to talk to him about the incident for the entire week of lunch times to discuss the incident further, which incidentally made me more and more nervous. He kept insisting that a parent had seen me spit in my hand, however I hit back that I was just ""wiping my nose"" and that was why I brought my hand up to my face. He asked me to write a note of my recollection of events on the Friday afternoon and for me to bring it to him as soon as possible.

The following week, I had written the note and had prepared to bring it to him, but I was far too scared. I had heard that the other guy had been given a week long suspension, which I was NOT keen on receiving myself. I spent the entire week with the note in my wallet and I spent every free second trying to avoid Mr. Footy like the plague.

Cut to a month later and he's announced that he is leaving the school at the end of the year. The end of that first week was the last I heard of the incident and no one asked me anything of it since. I consider myself very lucky that I got away with it and also carried the guilt with me for years before I told the first person, who quite humorously started laughing his ass off, slapped me on the back and told me I was ""fucking hilarious!""

So, does anyone else have any stories of shame that may or may not have caught people's attention in High School?

**TL;DR: I spat in my hand at an annoying kid during a football game then lied about it for the next 2 weeks to avoid getting suspended**

**tldr; I moved in with my parents 2 months ago to pay off some debt and keep going to school. I left everything that was good behind in my home town. A decent job that I really enjoyed, all my awesome friends and roommates, girlfriend, etc. My parents treat me like a child, like I can't accomplish anything on my own. Some of my financial issues are still catching up to me and when my dad found out, he went apeshit and yelled at me for the first time since he quit drinking, just to further my feelings of failure (it was already pretty damn humbling moving in after being on my own for 3 years). Can't find a job, have no friends, even if I had friends I can't afford to go out and do anything, I can't relate to any of my family, and I have no independence. My self esteem is crushed, and although I'm sure I've had slight depression my whole life, I'm at an all time low right now. I have nobody to talk to about this and I just need someone to make me smile or tell me everything will be okay. It's lame, but I can't go on like this. I had a plan to get out of my parent's house within a year but it's not happening.&lt;/tldr&gt;**


I moved out on my own when I was 21 when my parents moved out of state and lived with a girlfriend for 2 years. We broke up and I moved into a big house with 4 of my best friends and had an awesome year living with them while finishing up school. I received my B.S. and continued working at the hospital doing the same job I had been doing for 4 years making $9/hour. My degree is worthless so my plan was to go back and get my RN at a community college but it got delayed a year. My parents offered to let me move in with them (4 hours away) and pay my tuition for my RN and live rent free while I pay off my credit  card debt. Pretty sweet deal right? I had been living paycheck to paycheck barely making rent and bills and my accounts went delinquent. Plus it would give me a chance to reconnect with my mom/dad and older brother that lives nearby, since I've never been particularly close to any of them, even growing up I was very independent. 


Well I've been here for two months and I haven't found a job and I'm in undoubtedly more financial issues than before. Yesterday my dad opened my mail and found a collections notice from Comcast for some unreturned equipment (I had tried but their drop box was out of service as I was leaving my home state, so I planned on bringing it back my next visit). My dad flipped when he saw it, but I called them and got it straightened out and got a shipping address to send the equipment. He calmed down, but then later opened his mail and saw a $120 parking ticket from when I first moved up and didn't have my registration sticker on my car. I scheduled a hearing and completely forgot about it, so after that my dad yelled at me for the first time since he stopped drinking (I was 8 maybe). He was really upset and stormed out of the house and didn't talk to me the rest of the night.


Then tonight my dad randomly came into my room (no knock, as usual... I've told him before politely that I need my privacy) and harped on me for almost 10 minutes about all the things I need to do. I need to go to the post office to send off that equipment, make a counselor appointment for next semester, get a job, etc. All this stuff that I know I need to do and have a list set up to do it this week. He just kept harping on it like I was a child. I already feel like shit living here because I feel a huge lack of independence.


To add to all that, I have nothing up here. My brother is always too busy to hang out, I share no hobbies with anyone in my family, I'm home alone all day, I have no friends up here, I have no way of making money, and really no outlet for anything. I have friends in my weekend class but most work and go to school full time so I haven't really hung out with anyone outside of class/clinicals. I don't even enjoy any of my normal hobbies like playing guitar of video games. I feel like I left an important part of me back in my college town. I was constantly broke, but I lived with 4 of my best friends and I even left a great girl back home. We're still in touch and occasionally visit but it's not the same. All my college friends and coworkers are pretty much out of touch, I don't have money to visit more often, I don't have money to go out and do fun things here.

I've never was good with maths , did some biology and  never did any cs or accounting and stuff . I enjoyed learning about health and the human and I'm now sitting exams for psych sorry speech path and teaching since were the only available options in my community uni ( no financial support) . Yet ; I'm burnt our an dmentakky exhausted not even studying to pass in uni right now. 

 I realize  that I really don't know what I want to do with my life . My priorities are to learn because I know nothing, gain skills, fix my damn social anxiety and excessively introversion, expand my circle because I've remained like without friends at all with my negative attitude and strees and be abke to enter the Jon market , be able to make a work make money and a family that's my biggest value in life.  My family has been struggling financially mentally and with health problems and cancer history a lot and my parents are not able to assist me regarding tuition so they hope for me to pass in a local uni and have at least a degree to be more employable at whatever.  It sucks not knowing what to do , everyone tells fins your interests your passion etc .

 But I have none I just value the importance of making it in life more than doind something ahh wow and get fucked in  my personal life . I've never did something exciting or had any hobbies and the last 2 years I've been severky isolated  that I feel awkward even going to the grocery shop .

However; I feel so much oresure and the need to succeed saying the situation of my home and I really don't know how I have no goal I didn't even get in psych and I already want tk make it in something more employable and really with all my heart I feel that apart from the health section  I have nothing else to like even a little bit and I think I'm messing up my values the need to make it and make money and the thing with finding a job as well and the financial issue idk what to pick really . I was thinking of becoming a clinical psychologist bur seeing how mentally exhausted I'm now idk if I'm the right person to do so I'm exhausted I live a hell I'm my home and I'm so unable to help myself . 

I've Been living under the control and protectuin of my parents and their controlling and pushing behavior and now that I turned 19 they left me to take responsibility of my self and I know how to do nothing . Yes fuck I messed up a switch  a field in hs I was afraid and feeling useless and stayed without many options I'm not dump I see wtf is going around this world but I have no idea the situation would turn our like that I didn't tknkw I wouldn't have an option for a private school at all . I don't want to be ruined for life I have no strength to do 1000 things and try out shits and lost my energy totally I just want something safe and promising idk .. this local uni offers so few shit things I even though of pharm despite being shit at Chem but it's at a private college .. I though that working at a kharm selling drugs would be good but idk . I'm just burnt out I can't focus on one think I can't know what I like u just want to be benefited in the future instead of just having fun now because I know it's hard to make it and idk psych it's like a lost case .

[deleted],1305553328,/r/AskReddit/comments/hciw5/im_subletting_with_friends_this_summer_but_they/,"I thought I'd get a couple opinions on this one, so let's give it a go.

About a month ago, me and two friends decided that we would get a place for the summer, since we would all be in the same city doing undergraduate research with our school.

After two near confirmations on Craiglist, which led to two failures (you wouldn't believe how fast sublets get taken), we finally were able to submit a sublet form and confirm our housing with a nice three-bedroom apartment.

Now the backstory is that I've done about 90% of the work, emailing, calling, and checking out every single apartment we were interested in. Besides talking about the places over email or occasionally coming along with me to check out the place, I've been handling most of the conversations with potentials. We were originally going to be finding a three-bedroom and split it evenly three ways, utilities and all.

Now flash forward to the place we have now, and the people we're renting from have the bedrooms priced differently. We're supposed to pay each person separately as well. They're priced at about 750, 800, and 850 per month, for two and a half months.

Roommate B is automatically assigned the 800 room. He'll be staying for a couple extra days since Roommate A and I have early return housing to campus, and the 800 room is the only one open for a couple days extra.

Now Roommate A takes the 750 room. I let him choose that room, since he's been complaining he might not be able to get a paid research position this summer and thus siphoning his summer funds off his parents to pay for his part of the sublet. 

Now this leads to me to take the 850 room, obviously the largest room (but not by much). Disgruntled as I was at the time, I chose not to complain because - hey, what's a $250 difference (between the 750 and the 850 for 2.5 months) between poor college students? So we signed the contracts and confirmed out housing for the summer.

But obviously I wouldn't be here asking this question is $250 is a lot for someone like me. My parents can't afford to pay for any part of my summer costs, so I'm thankful I'm getting paid a couple thousand for the summer. Honestly, $250 can practically buy me groceries for several weeks here. 

So I approached my friends about this but obviously they seemed content to pay less than me and are basically saying no. Every time I approach the subject, Roommate A complains he's not getting paid and that splitting things between us evenly and then paying off the people we're subletting is too much of a roundabout way to do things. Roommate B does his best to do as little work as possible as well as shirk the question every time.

I've done pretty much all the work in finding the apartment, and I don't want to stir up trouble too much because money shouldn't have to get between friends. But when Roommate A said, ""In the real world, people don't give a shit about how much you work. You think Google interns get as much as the Google CEO?"" I was very much tempted to hold his head underwater for a couple minutes. (god I hope none of them read this).

I guess my mistake was in letting Roommate A choose which room he wanted instead of me jumping on the cheapest one, but he kept complaining about price and so I let it go and I hate being confrontation anyhow. And everytime I approach the situation, he tries to deflect it by saying we should be both be going after Roommate B for doing even less work and being less responsive. 

We'll still be splitting everything else evenly like utilities, but it pains me to have done all the work in acquiring the apartment, only to be paying the most out of my friends. I'm lost how to approach this now since it seems both my friends don't want to back down.

(sorry for the long post, but you have to read it to understand the whole story properly)

Do you think this is fair, and if not, what should I do!? This is stressing me out a lot actually, especially since they're both friends who just happen to piss me off at the moment.

TL;DR My roommates are paying less than me because of differently priced rooms, but I did most of the work and somehow got stuck with the most expensive one.

EDIT
Originally before signing the contracts, I talked to them about splitting it evenly, and they pretty called me out on making it more expensive for them so I backed down (""yes"" to anything you'll say about this part. I was retarded)

Techinically, Roommate B is making about three times what I am paying, and I'm making just enough to pay for sublet and food for the summer. 

So far I guess the consensus is that I was dumb and did it to myself. I wish I knew that I was going to be making tons of money down the road and looking back it wasn't going to matter, but architect majors end up poor D: Ah well... thanks for the advice everyone.",AskReddit,"I'm subletting with friends this summer, but they don't want to split the rooms evenly.

shakka-suede,1567897918,/r/college/comments/d136r8/i_started_from_cc_and_im_about_to_start_my_2nd/,"I’m entering my last semester of University at a Private 4 year. It’s quite an expensive school but I have a scholarship that helps me save money. Money is a huge issue for many hopeful students who are trying to pursue an education. 

Let’s go back into my timeline, shall we? 

In high school, I had a 2.5 but I got into a public university. My parents were tight on money at the time so I decided to go to CC. It’s close to my house, like a 5 min drive. I also had friends who were going too. My first year was rough, I failed a few classes. It was because I was naive, I didn’t balance my schedule. I had friends who went to 4 year schools and invited me over to party. I feel into a deep depression (I don’t need sympathy). I decided to change my habits and study my ass off to achieve my Associates. I left CC with a 2.9 gpa and receive my associates. I did this by sacrificing my summer and taking classes to finish on time. 

I got into a Private 4 year University and decided to major in Sport Administration due to my passion in Soccer. I took a semester off to save more money and have a mental break. It was necessary because I really wanted to think about my goals in life. I wanted to be a scout but my path took me to somewhere greater. I got an internship with the New York Red Bull in event and operations (completely different than scouting lol). I learned so much about the professional job environment and made so many connections. They took a shot at me because of my passion, not really what was on paper. The point of an internship is to learn about the job environment, plus your supervisors and leaders get to learn about you. 

I was then offered a match day position and been with the operations department for about a year. I wanted more though, I wanted to continue to grow as professional. My advisor at Uni suggested to me that I apply for Madison Square Garden. It took me 3 months to achieve my internship there. One key value I learn is to be patient. I have such a tough time being anxious and worried about my future (it’s normal, I know I’m not the only one). My biggest take from this was, have a sense of communication. I asked questions that were critical thinking and showed my passion for the internship. But DONT BE ANNOYING. I try my best to be patient, I didn’t want to keep emailing every other day. Once a week is fine. 

I then went through 3 interviews and was offered a Front of House Operations Student Associate Internship. I was ecstatic, knowing my past, I was so proud of what I accomplished over the past 2 years. MSG saw that I worked hard over the last year. I volunteered with the NY Giants, NYC marathon, and ICC Championship. Volunteering looks so good on a resume, it shows how you’re willing to work for free for your passion. I showed to the interviewer my recommendations from my volunteering and Red Bull internship (Use them as a leverage during an interview, it looks good! I promise!). 

I saved so much money and I got to think about what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. I’m leaving with a 3.7 GPA at my University due to my new study habits and time management skills.  My goal is to run events, this is fueled by my passion of sports and concerts. My first event at MSG will be Tyler, The Creator (An artist I looked up to so much) looking at his past, he achieved so much for a kid that was once a shit head (just like myself lol). Tyler showed the world that he can be taken seriously because of his craft and love for creating. I look up to him as a role model, because of his inspiration, it made me chase my dreams. My first Tyler show was back in 2015 during The Cherry Bomb era. Now, I’ll be working at his concert at the Worlds Famous Arena (plus more events and sports). 

My advice for you is, find your passion. And find people who have the same passion as you. I worked even harder when the people around me are trying to chase the same dream. If you’re sad, depressed, or just not having that pure energy. Meditate, yeah meditate. Clear your head, breathing exercises helped me so much. DO YOUR RESEARCH. Look online, go on LinkedIn, Google, Forums, ANYTHING. Learn from others and see what you can do. I love feeling motivated by others. Learn about a professional on how they got from point A to point B, don’t just network for the job sake. 

Best of luck to anyone finding an internship, it can be hard. I got denied from Barclays Center, Prudential Center, and MetLife Stadium. Don’t let that slow you down if you didn’t get into your hopeful internship, get back up. Use your resources like a university career center by practicing interview skills and touching up resumes. 

Thank you for reading,
Best:)",college,I started from CC and I’m about to start my 2nd Internship at MSG,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d136r8/i_started_from_cc_and_im_about_to_start_my_2nd/,1567919518.0,school is too expensive,5.906666666666666
karmicdancer,1450420756,/r/college/comments/3xbdck/i_22f_am_a_junior_level_psychology_major_doing/,"Tl;dr : I [22f] am in my junior year of undergrad pursuing my psychology degree. So far I have not had to take out loans because I have prepaid college credits and have worked fulltime since I was 18. University is harder than community college was and I see I cannot continue working like this and hope to do well. I am very scared of student loans. Advice please!

......

So I am currently a junior level psychology student and have realized I can't do fulltime work and hope to do well in University (transferred after I got my AA). While I love art and writing, my deepest desire has always been to be in the mental health field, perhaps as a therapist or counselor but I want to be able to have freedom within the field to change my job in case I get burnt out as a therapist, since many people do. I am serious about going to grad school, after many years of considering the pros and cons. So I want to do AWESOME now that I'm at University. I want to do well in my classes, hopefully get a part time job or internship related to mental health, join clubs and organizations (I have no interest in going Greek though) and I want to make it into the psychology honors society, as I think it would be good to have these experiences in my background and to network with others who will be in my field. 

But I am terrified of taking out student loans (and many tell me, with good reason). My roommate currently has $30,000 in debt after he graduated, and seems very calm about it, and has told me most people at college have to take out loans. But if I am looking at grad school, I know that I'm going to have to take out loans in the future too, and the idea of all this debt is overwhelming. If I can make it through undergrad without going to debt, I would feel much better about taking out loans for grad school. I don't know how these kids can be so calm about these huge piles of debt and I feel that they don't look at the reality of how much money that is and that it will probably be more to pay back with interest. I don't want loans to ruin my life, and have read many stories where they did ruin the person's life.

All that being said, I always file my FAFSA. I have not gotten very much at all from FAFSA in the past, usually only about $1000 - $1500, due to my age, my job, my grandparents income (they legally adopted me as a baby), etc. This month my grandpa retired meaning that both of my grandparents are now retired, and they cannot help me at all monetarily and I wouldn't want them to anyway. I also quit my job due to a bunch of personal health issues and life problems I have been going through that I won't go into, but that job sucked my happiness from me, and I am glad I quit. FAFSA has gotten me only $1500 for the upcoming spring semester even though I filed as an independent (not sure I did this properly, as I did have to give my grandparents income information), and with my own savings and the possibility of a part time job (as long as it does not mess with my grades) I think I can make it through this semester. But I need a financial plan for the semesters after that, I definitely want to take summer courses, and I am not sure that the Prepaid college program is going to stretch all the way to the end of undergrad because I wasted some of the credits as a freshman.

I have wondered if I would be able to get any disability financial aid since I am diagnosed Bipolar and have several years history of medical visits, one baker act, and it definitely effects my quality of life and ability to do well in school. I have researched some mental health scholarships and do plan on applying. I have not filed for any kind of disability with the government and am not sure if that's the right thing to do.

I am most concerned with the FAFSA. I feel like I have not been filing it true to my situation and that is why I receive so little aid. Also since all of these income changes happened at the end of this year, when I file in January, it's going to show that my grandparents and I had an income and thus result in a higher EFC. I want to sit with someone knowledgeable about the FAFSA, tell them my situation and see if they'll babystep me through the one I have to file in January, but I don't know who to turn to, as the financial aid office at my university can be difficult to deal with.

I have promised myself to see this degree through and take out loans if I have to, but I definitely don't want to do that. Can you guys give me any advice or information that might help me? I am located in Florida.",college,I [22f] am a junior level psychology major doing undergrad. I want very much to do well and make it into a grad program.

Independent_Editor62,1644068870,/r/college/comments/sl7bxd/im_genuinely_unhappy_in_my_college_and_i_want_to/,"For some context/disclaimer, I do not live nor study in the US, but I am American (I am stating this for a fairly important point that I'll bring up). 

I am currently a junior, and I am not happy at all in the college that I go to.

The only reason why I go here is because it's the only one that is the closest to me (20-30 minutes travel time) and my mom was an alumni of this school. The environment isn't necessarily toxic, but there is a reason why I only have 7 friends in this place and more friends from other universities. It's also fairly homogenous in terms of gender identity, which made me feel like I was in high school again (because I went to an all-girls school). I also don't think my school is as known as the ones that my friends go to, which is honestly important if I want to land a job a good company in the future.

I feel like my school didn't prepare me at all for the workforce, skillwise and mentally, and my growth as an individual has been stumped. I spend almost all of my days accomplishing requirements or doing readings for my courses, or resting from the exhaustion of doing so (which actually doesn't happen that often haha). Because of this, I don't really have time to pursue internships (which is something that is fairly common among college students in my country and a total resume booster) and develop the skills that I wouldn't get from school. My school also lacks a lot of options when it comes extracurriculars and student organizations (and almost all of them are limited to certain majors) so I can't really pursue interests that I am really passionate about. 

Although my school has (finally, at the insistence of my mom) applied and are waiting for an approval, for the past three years I wasn't able to use my GI bill for school since my school wasn't approved by the VA at the time I started college. (For more context about this, the GI bill is an education benefit given to US service members or veterans. My dad served in the Navy and was given one, but since he went to college prior to joining the military he transferred it to me so I can use it instead). If my college were to get accepted, I would only be able to use it during my senior year, which would be a complete waste since I don't really plan on going to grad school after college (especially since a lot of the programs that I'm interested in require work experience so I really need to get a job). 

There are also a lot of other reasons such as my physical and mental health, which has gradually and greatly suffered as each semester passed by. (I lost a lot of weight and I just feel sad and anxious every day).

Anyway I just want to know is it still even worth it to transfer to another university? I am in my second semester of my junior year, which means I only have two semesters left after this and then I am done with college forever. Moreover, there is a pretty good chance that my college might get approved by the VA, which would probably waste the efforts of the school admin in getting all the documents together for that (then again there's another person in my college who wants to use a GI bill according to my mom). There's also the fact that my parents and I might need to go to the VA to tell them about my change of schools if ever, which is a whole hassle in itself since the regional office is in another city and we have to commute using public transportation because of traffic (I've been there before and the travel was NOT fun). And since I wasn't able to use the GI bill for 3 years, my parents had to pay for my tuition out of their own pocket, and I feel like my parents will get mad at me for wasting their money if I bring up the fact that I want to transfer. 

I'll go ahead and answer some questions that I may get from this:

* academically I am doing quite well, but it was at the expense of both my physical and mental health
* I'm an only child so I have no one to transfer the GI bill to 
* my parents didn't want to send me back to the US for college since they don't trust me to be alone lol 
* my dad doesn't want me to live with my aunt (she's my only family member in the US) if ever because of some private reasons (not my story to tell)
* considering the situation in the US right now (and the fact that I am Asian), I don't think it's a good idea to go back

Despite my non-participation in any discussion, this has always been a place I've turned to when the opportunity provides itself; redditors have made me laugh, given me pause to question my beliefs, and have graciously provided information in all things (from topics as serious as politics to things as inane as why a videogame performs poorly on a specific hardware configuration). I suppose this is why I'm turning to you redditors for help, advice...anything.

I'm a 24 year old male. My teenage years weren't a happy time but the same can be said for most people; my hardships weren't particularly exceptional in any real regard. There was a fair amount of inter-family turbulence: my older half brother was a revolving-door juvenile delinquent who later got his fifteen year old girlfriend pregnant (my parents took them in), my mom was a shopaholic, and my dad was a semi-compulsive gambler who also liked to drink. The family business was eventually driven into bankruptcy by market forces and a lien was put on our house; whatever funds my parents had put into a college fund for my little brother and I were emptied to remove it. It was sold before the bank could foreclose it. My dad moved to Arizona and then California to find work in his field; from 17 until 19, I saw him twice. My mom worked three jobs (two 8 hour shifts a day, the third on weekends), but the combined income from both parents was unable to pay for every bill; my little brother and I worked as janitors at our school after hours so we could afford food and propane instead of just one. When I graduated from high school, I moved up to Canada to live with and marry my girlfriend of three years. After spending every penny I had managed to save on gaining permanent residency (as well as getting every work permit shot down) I worked while she went to school, hoping to rebuild my finances and support the pair of us while she attended college full time. 

We are now separated but living together due to financial constraints; she recently was forced to resign from her job due to cuts to the city's public transportation, and I make $11.88 an hour as a warehouse supervisor. Since I pay for everything but the grocery bill, I've been unable to afford the anti-depressants I had once been prescribed; I can afford either her medication or just mine, so I've gone without. Suffice to say, it's awkward hearing the texts of potential suitors or having to the spend the night on the couch when one is invited over. I'm dangerously close to losing my job; after being scheduled to do the demands of four people several weeks in a row (receiving/processing 26 pallets of merchandise per trailer four times each week, furniture/carpet/mirror carry outs, customer inquiries, fixture repairs, cart recovery, loss prevention, etc.), I had a massive meltdown and was written up for ""workplace violence"" after swearing loudly following six concurrent pages over the intercom. 

I have no friends or a support system to fall back upon. There's nothing I derive pleasure from, whether it's sex, conversation, exercise, or the occasional hobby. I feel dead or numb inside the vast majority of the time; the passing moments I feel anything, it's anger, frustration, or sorrow. Post secondary education is but the fevered dream of a madman since I've been out of the education system too long for full time studies and am too old to start the long, arduous journey of becoming a doctor or engineer. My hair is thinning out considerably in patches, either from stress or genetics (I can't honesty tell from which). I've often entertained thoughts of suicide but the thoughts of a few key people and the knowledge that I can't end my life in such a way that my insurance policy will pay out for an accidental death have been the only major deterrents; perhaps I'm too much of a pussy to feel death's sweet embrace no matter how much I wish to feel it.

I haven't created this post with the intention to bitch or whine about my situation; it simply is what it is.

I need a new perspective. Maybe someone here can suggest something to me to help me out.

Anyways, let's begin. How about some backstory? I'll try and keep it short.

**---If you want the NOW problem, skip this part---**

About a year and a half ago, I moved out of CO and back into my moms place in IL. I'd been in CO for 5 years, having moved from IL to live with my dad (divorced parents) and stepmom. That was in 10th grade. So I finish HS, and get into University (CSM) which I attend for 3 semesters before dropping out due to severe depression. My girlfriend had left me, my stepmom was a controlling, lying, manipulative bitch who had my dad whipped and my sisters and I nearly brainwashed. She convinced us to stop talking to our mom, and even my moms whole family. So far, my sisters are still under her spell and it breaks my heart, since they now won't talk to me. I'm with ""the enemy.""

I leave Uni and move in with a family friend, who turned out to be just as manipulative and controlling as my stepmom. I was told to see a therapist, and had to bike 20 miles across Denver to visit him since no one wanted to drive me. I was put on antidepressants, and then told to foot the bill. I was told to find a job, and given a week to do it; this was in the middle of the recession by the way. And that's some of the light shit I dealt with.

I found a job (Walmart!) and of course it was miserable, but I put up with it. Then, come Mothers Day (also my birthday) my mom calls out of the blue. I'm lonely, tired, miserable, and just want to talk to my mommy. So I do. Best phone call of my life, it was like a lonely point of light in the blackest night. The next day, I'm on break and get a call from my dad/stepmom. They bitched and whined and cussed me out, calling me a traitor, a backstabber, and a thief. I say ""fuck it"" and stop talking to them.

For the next year I live with some terrible roommates (except for you, Sam, you're still my brother) in a shitty apartment in an expensive part of town. Bad combo. I start smoking trees regularly (before I was only occasional) and cigs, which I regret massively. I experiment with a few other drugs, but always go back to my favorite, trees. Anyways, this whole time I'm still in contact with my mom, and when my lease on the apartment ends I move to IL.

**---The NOW problem---**

For the past 18 months I've been living with my mom. I got the best job ever, re-friended some old pals from around here, and started school again. I still smoke, but I've scaled it way back. I still need to quit cigs, too. But basically, I've become responsible and respectable. 

Then there's my stepbrother. He's schizo, and that's all I know about him. Not even what kind, he's just ""schizo."" He's also a massive cunt-douche from the very fires of Satans loins. He does absolutely nothing besides smoke everything, eat everything, and take everything. He's the most disgusting man I've ever had the displeasure to meet. And my stepdad, of course, adores him and would never make him work for his money or leave the house. He gets everything paid for by daddy, aka, by my mom because all the money my stepdad makes goes to mortgage and shit, my mom is treated like petty cash. 

And that's been going on for a while. Now, whats really upsetting is that all the money I borrowed from my mom and stepdad, I've paid back. In full. Him? Nothing. He sleeps all day and parties all night, then goes fishing on the weekends. Sometimes I want to just end him.

My mom and stepdad recently filed bankruptcy, and yet my stepdad STILL won't acknowledge that his son is the problem. What makes it worse is that since I'm an atheist, I'm almost subhuman to him and he's told me he only put up with me at the start for my moms sake. I like to hope he's changed, but who knows? 

Anyways Reddit, I've talked with my mom a little about this, and I've told her my opinion: To tell my stepdad to either kick the moron the room over out, or we're leaving. She says he'd choose his son, and I believe her. 

So, Reddit, is there anything else we can do? Because I sure as hell feel clueless as to how to help my mom. I see her sliding into depression, and I have no idea what to do. Depression is a dark place; I've been there. I don't want my mom to go there. 

*takes breath*

OK, now that that's out, I can eat in peace.

caketastydelish,1476437194,/r/college/comments/57figq/question_for_librarians_or_people_that_are/,"I am a Computer Information Systems major with a double minor in English and Accounting

Alright first a little about me... I have a mental illness called Schizoaffective disorder and a tl;dr version of that illness means my mind is fragile and can't handle stress well, roughly 80% of people with my illness are unemployed and the majority of those that do work only work part time, and work minimum waggish jobs.

So ""this other major would pay more"" is not necessarily relevant, if the work that comes with it is beyond my mental stamina.  A job I can actually survive with is more important than something that could theoretically pay more, but is very stressful and I will hate every minute of it.

I have always been ""the guy"" among my friends and family with computer problems.  I have a passion for the IT field.  I wouldn't go as far to say I hate coding (you actually do learn to code with a CIS degree, just not as much as CS).  I just get more satisfaction helping people in a direct way than a job where I'm stuck in a cubicle only coding.  I have an INFJ personality type and get a huge satisfaction when I help people with their problems.  While you are technically helping people with problems when you code, it feels much more abstract than going up to someone, physically meeting them, and help them get their computer/network to work.

 With that being said, if I absolutely can't get a job without more coding, I can learn it on my own.  I say this because (I've heard) you don't need a CS degree to get a programming job anyway.  A friend of mine also tells me there are coding ""boot camps"", which I would attend if push comes to shove.  That said I'm saving it for a last resort option, because I imagine a coding job as very stressful, and I personally doubt I would have the mental capacity to handle it.

Based on what I hear, Accounting is a good compliment to a CIS degree.  I'm also naturally good with numbers, making it all the more favorable.  Beyond that, people with my condition are known to be exceptionally bad at managing their money.  If nothing else, the accounting classes could help me with my own independence skills.

Finally the English:  Based on what I hear lots of STEM majors are bad with essays/grammar/critical thinking, so having a background in English as well could be icing on the cake.  I have my own blog (which I won't advertise here due to the rules of this subreddit) but most people who look at it consider me to be a decent writer.

Here are the different options I see for myself after graduating:

1) work at a PC help desk.  Even if it pays not much more than minimum wage, it would be a job I'd be easily qualified for, and thus could easily handle.  Remember: the vast majority of people with my condition either work part time, or don't work at all.  Thus, I'm already beating the odds.

2) the same as 1) but work my way up to network engineer/database administrator/whatever, and after that maybe even quit working for someone else, and freelance as a network consultant.  And with the background in accounting, there's a good chance I'd actually survive with my own business.  It's also worth noting that people with my condition have highs and lows, in terms of energy.  If I freelance that means I get to make my own schedule, which would be hugely beneficial.

3) Work in a library.  In order to become a head librarian I would eventually have to get a Masters in Library Science.  The good news, though, is that this is a job (I think) I can easily handle.  I was a library assistant at my school for 2 years (once when I was 14 and once when I was 18).  I've also volunteered at libraries several other times throughout my adult life.  

The other good news (and please correct me if I'm wrong about this) is that someone with an undergraduate degree in CIS with a dual minor in English and Accounting would be wonderful for a library.  Most people wanting to be librarians, major/minor purely in the liberal arts.  While that might have been good 50 years ago, the library of today is quite a bit different.

4) Become a CPA.  I've already taken a lot of college hours (I used to be an English major but switched out of that when I realized I was wasting my time).  You need 150 college hours to sit for the CPA exam, which I would have by the time I graduate.  Becoming a CPA would pretty much be a last resort option, but it is at least technically out there.  There's only 18 hours worth of Accounting classes in my minor, which is obviously not enough knowledge for the CPA exam.  It would require additional college, but again, this is there as a backup plan.

I would like to think I have this all thought-out pretty well... but obviously I don't know as much as people who have worked in these fields.",college,Question for librarians or people that are familiar with libraries.

B_Bibbles,1663985514,/r/socialwork/comments/xmg7v4/today_i_advocated_my_butt_off_for_a_client/,"I want to preface this by saying that I'm 33, so I'm not your ""traditional"" intern. I'm a Veteran, I've been to inpatient mental health treatment, I've been in inpatient substance use treatment centers, so I'm a less timid than most of my peers.

We have a client who had some type of accident when they were younger and it has rendered him hard of hearing. He has adapted to reading lips very well and wears hearing aids. He has been in our care for two weeks to this point and has had to rely on written information or asking staff to pull their masks down so he can watch them talk. I had asked earlier in his care if he knows American Sign Language and he said that he was. Honestly, I was so pumped about that because for my foreign language requirement, I took three semesters of American Sign Language throughout my school career. I am, by no means, fluent, but I have been proficient enough to be able to communicate with him. When I asked some of the staff what we can do about getting him an interpreter, they all just kind of passed the buck onto someone else and eventually I got a half answer of ""Well, he can read lips and we can write stuff down, so....""

Today when I went into work, I noticed that one of the case managers was complaining because this particular client wanted to meet with her every day because he had phone calls to make and he can't use the phone without help because he can't hear the phone. The case manager was not frustrated by his disability, but by the fact that nobody has figured anything out for her client who required additional services. 

I made it my mission that, come hell or high water, I wasn't going to leave work today without having some type of interpreting service figured out so that he is able to access the same level of care that everyone else has access to. It took me four hours total, and a lot of meeting with various people employed at the hospital, but I finally did it. I can't even begin to explain the amount of excitement that I had when I was able to get a client the type of assistance that they required. It was more rewarding to me than anything I've done in social work thus far, which admittedly isn't very much. We talked a lot in the ASL classes about the kind of discrimination and obstacles that the deaf community still faces because often times, people don't know how to handle that issue. 

I asked several people in the corporate and chief officer positions what could be done to help the client and never really got a clear answer because they were trying to put out other fires that were, admittedly, bigger issues. However, this was a huge obstacle for me to get figured out. One thing that I thought about was that I'm at a For-Profit hospital. This means that money is obviously the biggest motivating factor for their services. I did a lot of Google searches but I finally found a list of interpreters who were certified in ASL in our community. I called a few of them and luckily, one finally answer my call. When I spoke with her, she had said that she had provided interpretation services for our clients in the past, but I knew that billing through insurance would have been a potential barrier. I asked her if she knew how we could go through the client's insurance (Medicare/Medicaid), she told me that she would just bill my site directly after the client was discharged and they would pay her for the services that she provided.

Now, armed with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the threat of either a potential lawsuit or a bill for interpreter services upon client discharge, I went to the people that weren't very helpful and told them what I'd gotten figured out. Suddenly, people were a lot more willing to put the work in to help me figure out what interpreting services we'd used in the past. I finally met with the Chief Clinical Officer who mentioned that they have iPad tablets and a subscription to a service called IRIS. I got the tablet and met with the ASL interpreter who was working and she informed me that they provide 24 hour services and that whenever we need it, we can get on the app and connect with a live ASL certified interpreter anytime it was needed.

When I say that I felt so great after finally getting it figured out, I realized that this is why I joined the social work field to begin with. We all want to help clients overcome obstacles in their lives, and I was actually able to solve an issue. I apologize if this was super long, but I wanted to share a real victory that I had today. The “high” of helping someone get the care that they need was greater than any feeling that I got when I used drugs. This is why I got into the field of social work.",socialwork,Today I advocated my butt off for a client!,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/xmg7v4/today_i_advocated_my_butt_off_for_a_client/,1664007114.0,can't pay for school,5.826666666666667
[deleted],1297981769,/r/AskReddit/comments/fnhwm/how_to_live_with_agoraphobiaibs_especially/,"I don't even know where to begin, this has the potential to be a very long story but I'll try my best to limit it as much as possible.

It all started when I was around 12 (20 now), in the 6th grade I started to develop these panic attacks while in school. Which lead to stomach cramps and pains, almost like the feeling of diarrhea without actually having diarrhea the majority of the time, that's the best I can describe the feeling. So obviously being a child, I would complain about the stomach pains (symptoms) and not particularly the issue (the panic attacks). After multiple trips to countless doctors that study all sorts of systems linked to intestinal issues, I got multiple diagnosis' of IBS -- Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This was absolutely devastating for me, being a shy kid just starting out middle school. It got to the point where when I was 14 I would take 6 Imodium AD pills the night prior to school. It helped me for a few years, probably more mentally than physically. Thankfully both of my parents had jobs at the time, because I went through bottles so fast and they were so expensive. During school I would not eat nor drink any liquids... at all. Not under any circumstances. I would come home and eat one meal immediately following school, and wouldn't eat till the following day at that time. It was just plain unhealthy.

Fast forward to High School, the downhill descent from this point was much more rapid entering 9th grade. Everything was on a much grander scale and I just couldn't handle it mentally, I was weak. The Imodium at this point wouldn't work for me any more. Half way through the day the panic attacks and subsequent stomach pains returned with a vengeance. I started to miss out on the AM bus by hiding in my backyard till my parents would leave for work, and then enter in through the back door to stay home. I was so ashamed for having to do this, hiding in my backyard like a coward, it was embarrassing. So that act didn't last long, I was finally discovered and driven to the school by my parents where they spoke with the guidance counselor and some other front office people. This ended up working out for the best for me because they suggested a program that runs in my county that allows me to be schooled at home over the phone with teachers employed by the county. This is how I spent the last 3 years of my high school career up until I graduated.

Throughout the years, I've sought professional help from doctors to psychiatrists. I've taken every pill to suppress my anxiety prescribed to me, nothing worked, everything got worse. I felt like no one could help me so I frankly just gave up. To get to these people I had to overcome my fear every time I visited them, why keep sticking my hand in the fire if I was getting burnt?

That's some of my past story, here's a little bit about my current or most recent doings.

I run a website where I make a very modest amount of money, roughly $500/m. Nothing substantial, enough to buy my own food, certainly not enough to support myself entirely. I don't want to live with my parents forever, I really wanted to leave and live with a friend 2 years ago but I obviously couldn't pay the money necessary for my stay there. Which is why I looked toward disability benefits, I applied once and was denied. Partly because I didn't see the doctors assigned to me by the people who oversee my application, mainly because at this point in my life it's to the point where I can't even drive to the corner store literally blocks away. It all manifested over the years and just exploded around the time of highschool unto now. I have a fear of having the uncontrollable stomach pains that it makes my anxiety worsen to the point where leaving the house is a no go. It's almost like a snowball effect, one thing feeding the other to the point where they're both uncontrollable. I didn't even bother to appeal my disability application because that would more than likely lead to an appeal in front of a judge and all that good stuff. Obviously out of the question.

That's where I am at. I really didn't see it ever getting to this point, needing Government assistance like this, it's like admitting defeat. I hate living like this but no one could find out a way to help me. Some may not find this believable, and I really wish I was lying, but I'm not. I'm embarrassed to post this all, even on a throwaway, but I ask for advice from Reddit. I would welcome any advice or answer any questions to help lead to better advice.

bettermentboss,1557269990,/r/college/comments/blxkjd/7_honest_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started/,"So you don’t want to spend $25,000 a year for college just to mess it up and have your life ruined? Great, let me share with you 7 honest things I wish I knew before I started college:

Number 1: You’re going to have to figure things out yourself

In college, there is no more hand holding and this means that your learning will entirely rely upon you. My experience was that in college, once you paid your tuition, having professors care about your academic success is rare, meaning that if you are struggling, you need to find ways to help yourself out. I remember starting university here in Canada and feeling totally overwhelmed in class and when I tried to talk to the professor, he would never make the time to go through my questions leaving me to have to work with his assistants in order to get the support I needed. Therefore, the first thing to know when starting college is that you will have to rely upon yourself in order to succeed.

Number 2: Networking is key

Sure, you signed up for college to party…I mean get a degree well one thing you cannot neglect is networking. Now, I know it is tough. As students, we are in a constant cycle of being bombarded by readings and assignments followed by midterms and finals which leaves little time to consider employment related activities. However, do you want to me the only one of your friends who graduates with no job prospects because you didn’t take the time to build relationships with employers? Therefore, the second thing to know is that networking should be prioritized when in college.

Number 3: Resourcefulness equals success

Honestly, I am not the smartest dude but I am probably one of the most resourceful. Being resourceful for me meant having a few high performing students in each class I could depend on for help on assignments when needed or to have available if I was given a group project to tackle. Alternatively, being resourceful also meant leveraging the school’s free services like resume writing workshops and networking fairs to help me find the best jobs possible. Therefore, the third thing you must know in order to succeed in college is how to leverage the resources around you.

Number 4: You will be judged based on your major

In high school, you were judged for just about everything but lucky for you, in college you will only be judged by one thing: your major. For me, I was always called a bean counter or a numbers nerd by my friends for being in accounting but guess is asking for tax help now…yeah you guessed it! Regardless of what program you are in, as long as you enjoy the subject and see a career path that will result from your hard work then don’t worry when people pass judgment on what major you chose.

Number 5: College is a precious time in your life

College is a fantasy land. You can sleep in during the middle of the week and any night is a good night to party. With that being said, college is still stressful and something you shouldn’t take lightly, but when in college, appreciate being able dedicate yourself to your studies and enjoy the lack of responsibilities that will soon enter your life once you start your career.

Number 6: Your grades don’t matter as much as you think

Sure, you’d love to bring home a good grade for your mom to put on the fridge but in reality your grades in college don’t matter as much as you think. My personal stance on grades in college is that you should try your best get the best marks possible but not at the expense blocking out all the other positive aspects. For instance, if you never attend social events, network or exercise then you are doing yourself a disservice because those grades you are striving to obtain probably won’t mean anything to you in the future. Therefore, the sixth thing you should know before starting college is that your grades matter but they aren’t everything. 

Number 7: Picking a major based on future earnings is wrong

We all want to make it rain but at what expense? I feel fortunate that my career as an accountant has been very enriching but for a surprisingly high amount of graduates, their field of work is not as satisfying as they would have imagined even if it is paying them a fair sum of money. I feel strongly that you should follow your passion when deciding on a major in college because if you love what you do then you will surely become good enough at your craft to support yourself financially. Conversely, if you choose a major based on salary, you may be financially solid but dread each and every day you have to work making your career one long slog. So if you’re deciding on a major right now, keep in mind potential earnings but prioritize your passion for the subject if you want to maximize what you get out of college.

Hope this provides some wisdom to those who are about to start their own college journeys!",college,7 Honest Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started College,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/blxkjd/7_honest_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started/,1557291590.0,struggling with tuition,5.826666666666667

&amp;nbsp;


Alright some context first: 

&amp;nbsp;


Right now I'm a freshman in College with a unique situation. My dad's work contract here in the U.S. (Specifically Hawaii) ends on July 2017, meaning that our U.S. Visa will expire around that time too and the whole family has to go back to the Philippines, including me. This means I'm currently in the process of doing transfer applications for schools. 

As of now I have 4 options of where I want to continue my studies, but I was hoping to narrow it down a little bit more with your help. To further help with whatever helpful advice I would be receiving, I just want to add that I plan to become an English teacher for Japanese High School students in Japan (So probs Major in English, Minor in Japanese/Double major in them/Major in Japanese, Minor in English. Not sure which is best)

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in the Philippines:**


•	**+**The most feasible path. It's my Motherland so I have no qualms in studying here, especially in my Alma Mater


•	**+**My dad will be able to pay for the tuition even without the need for scholarships (though a scholarship will be beneficial in any case). 


•	**+**I'll be able to see all my cousins, friends, classmates, and everyone I know again. I'll also be able to jam and have fun with them.


•	**-**It'll be tough to have a part time job here while having a College life. Also internet is shitty.


•	**-**I've lived here for 16 years. It's not a bad thing, but the world is so much more than just studying in my Alma Mater and living in the Philippines. I want to meet new people, experience a different culture, have an adventure, live independently

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in Hawaii:**


•	**+**I'm already studying here, so I'm getting used to how College is in the university I am right now. I just need to apply for a Student Visa to continue studying here or anywhere in the U.S.


•	**+**I have a part time job here while still being able to maintain good grades (A's and B's).


•	**+**Kawaii Kon


•	**-**Tuition is expensive as fuck. My dad can pay for it as of now, but once he returns to the Philippines, his salary will lessen and won't be enough to pay for my college while providing the necessary needs for the family.


•	**-**Additional expenses for dorming cause I’ll be living by myself. It’s roughly the same price as the tuition of my university right now. Meaning around 20k total. But I have made many friends here in my 2 years of living so there might be a chance that I can live with them.

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in the Mainland:**


•	**+**New adventure. New experiences. New culture. New life


•	**+**Currently applying to Boston College and Boston University (Not sure which is better). So as much as the education here in Hawaii is good, I know I can receive a better education in the mainland. I also heard from my Japanese co-workers that the people and place in Boston is pretty nice.


•	**-**More expensive tuition plus dorming. I can probably get a part time job here though.

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in Japan:**


•	**+**Probably the best way to improve my Japanese since I’ll be living in the country itself


•	**+**New adventure. New experiences. New culture. New life. I’ve never been to Japan. It’s one of my goals to be there at least once, see the cherry blossoms, buy anime merchandise, visit famous places, etc etc. I just love Japan. 


•	**-**Language barrier. I’m not fluent in the language yet. I’m still learning (in Japanese 201 right now). I’ve sought advice and people have told me to try applying to Tokyo University as it accepts many international applicants. But to my knowledge, it’s like the Harvard or Boston of Japan, so it only accepts the best of the best. There's bound to be an entrance test too. I’ve also heard that international applicants who apply there are already fluent in Japanese.I think you can take supplementary Japanese classes though to help you catch up with things.


•	**-**Tuition and dorming are probably less expensive than Mainland, but still expensive. I’m planning to see the Japanese consulate here for anything about scholarships for studying there. I know one of them would be the Monbukagakusho Scholarship but that’s pretty hard to obtain.



&amp;nbsp;



As for FAFSA, I’m a non-U.S. citizen, but I’m still applying for it anyway to see if I can get anything. I won’t lose anything doing it anyway. I’m also currently finding scholarships for international transfer students and international students in general. 

&amp;nbsp;



So yeah! I’m sorry this was pretty long. I just wanted to give enough information to show that I did do my research first before posting here, and to answer probably most of the questions needed to give a substantial advice. I do hope that this situation wasn’t too specific that it’ll get deleted or too vague that it’ll be hard to comprehend :)

awesomehippie12,1475808768,/r/college/comments/569apb/living_with_parents_a_good_choice_or_not/,"I'm gonna be graduating high school in the coming year, and I was wondering if it would be reasonable to live with my parents, or go off to a great college somewhere.

Now, before you answer right away, I'd like to take a moment and explain my situation:

I'm a fairly well off student, with a 4.1 GPA Weighted, and 3.8 Unweighted. My ACT's 31 (I jumped 3 points from 28 to 31 between the last test and this one so I am expecting to do somewhat better the next time I take it this month). I took the SAT subject tests, still waiting to get my scores back. I have a pretty good transcript, and this is the basic rundown:
-Freshman year: No weighted classes, just the prereqs to prep me for the classes the rest of high school
-Sophomore year: Starting out slow with just AP chem and AP Human Geo, with the rest unweighted
-Junior year: Ramped it up this year with the IB program, with my only non-weighted class being Java programming (1 semester), which brings junior year to a grand total of 15.5 semesters worth of weighted classes. Only AP class was AP Macro (1 semester)
-Senior year: Ramped up even more, with those IB classes going into their HL II phase. I have a lot of B's because I'm reaching the limit of my ability, and I'm just scraping to survive at this point. Decided to take an extra SL and extra HL just for the lolz and now I'm choking on it.

Now that you have a basic rundown of how it is in school, I'd like to explain my concern with college itself:

My parents work for a university in town, and it's not the best university in the world, but they offer tuition remission, and if I went there, I calculated that my cost to go there would be $10k before scholarships kick in. I've looked into another college in town, and my counselor informed me of a similar rate because of my ACT score (a 32 would get me full ride).

Now, these aren't the greatest colleges. And I don't know if they're the fit for me yet. Mind you, my mindset is still that of  college being a prize to be won, not a match to be made, so I might be missing a step in my reasoning. 

So, as I expand my exploration of colleges, I'm eyeing Ivy league schools (idk if I would even get in, but let's assume in a hypothetical that I am a reasonable candidate and they do invite me to join their school). Now, these colleges probably don't offer the same financial advantages that a smaller school would offer its students, nor would it offer something like tuition remission. On top of that, I would have to pay room and board, inflating my costs by at minimum, $10k, the cost of an entire 4 years at the university my parents work at. *and that's just a fraction of what I would pay*. But say I get some hefty financial incentives, say somehow I knock off a majority of it through scholarships, grants, financial aid, etc (I assume 20k/yr would be reasonable? maybe? remotely?). 

Is it worth forgoing the **guaranteed** free/next to nothing education at a small university, to shoot for a possibility of going to a larger institution for a bigger post-graduate income at the cost of paying more for an education? This is assuming I do get in, and assuming that said hypothetical scholarships can fund me at the $20k/yr (correct me if my estimate is wrong).

I have looked at college ROIs ( http://www.payscale.com/college-roi ) and done calculations based on them, and the math says that bigger, out of state colleges are better. But financial incentives, along with room and board savings, as well as proximity to my parents, says smaller colleges are better. I can't tell if the opportunity cost of choosing a small college matches the incentives I gain by making that choice. At the same time I cannot justify the opportunity cost of choosing a large college to the **possible** favor I receive when I get a job (Do employers really say ""hey this kid graduated from Harvard, let's hire him and not the kid from Hawaii State University""? (I'm sorry if I offended anyone, it was an arbitrary example using my favorite state))

My parents' stance on this is that they want me to go to a small university, so that they can keep an eye on me and out of learning bad habits (might seem funny, but it's a very serious issue when it comes to my parents)

Thank you in advance for your advice, and I hope to hear from someone (or a lot of people) soon!

TL;DR - I don't know wether to go to a big university or a small one. Small ones give me money, but big ones give me cred. Parents want me to go to a small university. I'm saying that I want to go to a big one if it outweighs the benefits of going to a small one. Please give me advice on what to do.

seahorseolympics,1317804232,/r/AskReddit/comments/l1j53/im_not_sure_what_to_do_about_grampa/,"Okay, this might sound long and whiny and stupid, but it's driving me and everyone in my house crazy. I'm 22 years old, and I'm living in a two bedroom apartment in the Bay Area of California with my ex-girlfriend, our daughter, my ""mother-in-law"", a roommate, and recently my ""mother-in-law""s 90 year old father. We've had to take him because we can't afford to keep him in a nursing home, or really anywhere but with us, because he gets money from his pension and it's barely keeping us afloat. 

I have a job at Whole Foods and I do alright for me and my bit of the family. My ex is looking for work and is in the mean time getting welfare money. Mother-in-law (who I'm going to call ""MIL"" from now on) gets school loan money and uses it to pay our nearly 2000 dollar a month rent. Our daughter doesn't need anything, but she is four months old, and needs quite a bit of attention, obviously. Now even before we fell into our hole MIL still had to take care of Grampa's finances and deal with him. 

He is a gruff, hard to take care of man. He needs things done a certain way, and gets crazy if they don't go right. He needs breakfast as soon as he wakes up, and needs his following meals made for him promptly as well as snacks. That doesn't sound too bad if you don't take into account that he makes a huge mess while he's eating, makes the most disgusting noises as he's eating. He will literally shit his pants while eating and just sit in it until someone says something or makes him go to the bathroom. As a matter of fact his shitting himself is the biggest problem he's got. He won't tell you when he has to go, he will just go. He doesn't stay in nursing homes very long because he won't stay in his rooms and curses at the staff. And nobody wants to keep him around. We can't afford the places that put up with this kind of thing.

I am gone at work almost all evening and taking this man to the bathroom is literally the last thing i want to do when I wake up and when I come home. I take care of my daughter during these times. My ex is usually the one to take Grampa to the bathroom as me and MIL have weak stomachs. In exchange I cook for him. But if I have been up all night with my daughter and he needs his breakfast I get to a point where I'm just not sleeping at all. MIL is gone for most of the morning as she goes to school and needs to take a certain amount of classes to keep her grant money coming and keeping us going. she takes him in the evening when I'm at work. But his constant feedings and trips to the bathroom along with his general grossness and shitty attitude is wearing thin with everyone in my house.

I'm 22 years old and I have a kid, I already have a lot stacked against me. I am not trained as an orderly, and really I kind of fucking hate this man who I'm not related to, and since I am not even dating his granddaughter I don't see what the fuck I am doing here. I am trying to pull my weight for my ex, as she's still my best friend and since she's looking for work she's stuck at home all day watching the baby and grampa. She deserves better than this, and I try to help as best as I can. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for, if there is anything anyone knows about that can help get us out of this rut. We aren't trained for this kind of shit, and we just found out our roommate is leaving because he can't bare to share the bathroom with this shit covered old man. I don't blame him. And now with out his money we may be getting evicted. 

I don't really know what to do anymore. The house smells like shit all the time, everybody's tired from either waking up with Grampa or waking up with the baby. We're broke and we have no foreseeable way out of this fucking debacle until the old man dies. I have never thought about murdering someone before until now. I would never do it but, I am a sane person who has now seriously thought about killing another human being. I feel like we are all falling apart since he moved in. Fuck, even just some advice or tips or something would be great. Thanks for listening.

EDIT: grampa never comes into our room and baby doesn't ever leave our room. so health of baby is at a minimum. but if it is still a risk please let me know.

anonymuscles,1289891544,/r/AskReddit/comments/e6u68/dammit_a_study_in_another_mans_wife/,"Just writing this so I don't end up writing something else, like an apologetic ""I did your wife"" kind-of note.  

HELL!  Women!  The hell's up with them, anyway?

So I'm down in Oakland, CA right now, having driven down from Portland OR yesterday (about 10 hours).  I came to visit a friend from school, a girl (and 'the wife' in question) I used to have a small thing with many years ago.  We never dated, but did room together for a year.  It was a sexually-charged time, with both of us dating a lot, but never dating each other.  We never even made out, though we came close a few times.  We've had a few late-night, sometimes-intoxicated conversations regarding 'what if?' over the years, but for the most part we've both moved on.  She was married in 2007 to a really nice guy, someone I've met multiple times and become loose friends with.  

I'm down here now, have been since last night, and the plan was for the three of us to hang out, visit SF, just take in the sights and sounds.  I've got a couple of days down here, was planning on leaving Wednesday, and the three of us were going to relax and enjoy (unbeLIEVEable weather down here right now - almost 80F, clear blue &amp; sunny; I freaking love California).  

But.  

He got sick.  Stomach flu or some-such, I don't really know.  All I know he wasn't feeling well this morning, so she and I took off, after making sure he was all right and all.  I was the guest, after all, and she my long-time friend; someone had to entertain me, dammit, and it really was her I'd come to see anyway.  So the day went well.  We had fun, I bought her damn near everything (food+drinks), and just enjoyed catching up.  She decided it'd be fun to go out tonight, too, and hit up what local nightlife was available on a Monday evening.  Sure, I thought, why not.  Her husband wasn't able to go to that either, as he was still under the weather, but he saw us off before going back to bed.

The night went pretty well until she got some drinks in her.  I was drinking as well, but she's a short girl and two sips of anything will capsize her tolerance boat.  I spent about $60 on liquor for the both of us this evening (equivalent to about three shots, god-damn expensive-ass town), and with her downing the lion's share of that, she got pretty, uh, friendly.  After a couple of hours of drinking and some dancing, she leaned in and asked me if I could keep a secret.  I said sure and she kissed me.  I pulled away immediately, and she carried on as if nothing had happened, but even the reminder of the giant diamond on her left hand wasn't enough to stop my mind from wandering.  

I got her some water, lots of water, and we left and began the walk back (less than a mile).  She wasn't wasted by any means, just tipsy, but she asked me what I'd thought of kissing her and if I wanted to do it again.  She said she knew it was wrong, but she'd wanted to do that for five years but had never found the courage.  She added something about her husband having to work all day tomorrow, but didn't go further than that.  I might've been a little more sober than her, but even so, didn't trust myself to reply, as I'd thought about it on and off over the years as well.  She's a gorgeous girl and has a capacity for ESP, so I knew she could read my response even without saying a damn thing.  

She and I have plans to spend tomorrow in SF.  I don't know that there will be any alcohol involved, but even so, should I go?  Her husband does have to work in the morning, and assuming he isn't still sick, he'll be gone all day.  I don't feel comfortable spending time with just her right now.  I really want to... but I know I shouldn't.  

Now that I'm removed from the situation, this whole thing seems like a bad porn movie, or one of those fictitious Penthouse story accounts.  Really, when does this shit happen ""for reals""?  Maybe it's more common than I know, I don't know.  Either way, I'm sitting in their living room now.  They're both asleep, or getting there, and I'm wide awake, a little at a loss of what to do.  I could pack up and get out tonight, but that'd probably seem more weird than if I just left early tomorrow.  I don't want to tell him what happened, and I know she won't, but I don't want to look him in the eye tomorrow, either.

Awesome stuff.  Really, not very consequential and a pretty insignificant story overall, but just my personal wrestling match for the evening.  Any clever insights or sage advice is appreciated, but I'll probably just see tomorrow out as planned, and make sure she avoids the booze.

'night!

Codiac500,1514700987,/r/college/comments/7n6zyg/how_can_i_get_this_f_off_my_transcript_i_dont/,"To give some context, I'm a freshman Computer Science major that just completed my first semester attending a University on an academic scholarship that provides full tuition, food, and room (up to traditional housing price). The rules as I remember them for keeping my scholarship is that I must maintain above a 3.2 GPA and be a full time student (12-16 credit hours a semester) Computer Science 1 is the class I failed. I have a decent understanding of Comp Sci basics because I originally learned C a little through 10th and 11th grade in highschool then took an AP class (Computer Science Principals, taught in Java) my senior year. I passed the AP exam and could have skipped comp sci 1 but I chose not to because it and the following classes were taught in a language I hadn't yet learned (C++) and I felt it would be an easy A.

I took Computer Science 1 this semester and was doing good in the class overall. I made A's and B's and 1 C on some simple online quizzes he had, a high B on the midterm, an 84 on the final, and missed one quiz (I had forgotten about it while attending a Hackathon, ironic right?). So the issue comes with this final project I had messed up on. I did the project correct short of two issues I noticed (didn't verify user input and didn't finish commenting the code all the way through) but all other aspects of the fairly long project worked fine so far as I could tell. It wasn't an especially hard project. Well, I didn't submit it right away because I was cleaning it up and, as I said, commenting the code (explaining what parts did what so it was easy to read). The day it was due I was commenting it, when I remembered I had a Calc test the next morning and panicked. It was a major thing because I didn't completely understand the math content and I spent the afternoon studying for it. I lost track of time, looked up, and I was 15 minutes past the deadline to submit my project. I freaked, tried to submit, was denied, and so emailed it to my professor with a message saying I wasn't able to submit it online and hoping he understood. He had told other students they could email him the project with corrections. In hindsight, I probably should have gone to talk to him the next day and explain the situation and hope he forgave me. But I simply hoped for the best. In the end, he didn't grade my project at all. After multiple emails, he finally responded the day before Christmas, long after final grades had been posted and claimed I never submitted the project. I had a flat 0 in as my grade so I asked why my other assignments weren't considered by their system. He said without 100s in everything else the project being a zero would have caused me to fail anyways so it didn't matter I'd still have an F. I asked him to reconsider and explained my situation, putting emphasis on my understanding of his classes content as well as my involvement in the comp sci club he oversees and the importance of my GPA to my scholarship so I can afford schooling. After looking, he said I never sent him the project in his email, not 15 minutes late like I claimed, not ever. And that late work wasnt acceptable as explained in the syllabus. (I give it to him, it was clear, but it was an honest mistake). I forwarded him the email that I had sent with my project so he could see it was done as well as a screenshot of my sent emails showing the date and timestamp and never received a response or updated grade after that. 

I'm at a loss. Due to the F, my GPA was set to a flat 3.0, putting my scholarship at risk if I don't bring it up. I can't afford college without it. My real question, with all of this context, is hopefully someone has any advice on what I should do to fix this? I have nothing against retaking the class. My biggest concern is getting the F off my transcript. I understand this may just have to be a hard lesson learned and strive for a 4.0 next semester so I don't lose my scholarship (it'll be checked at the end of the next semester), but if anyone else has any ideas please tell me. Is there anyone higher up I could go to for help sorting this out? Any other routes or suggestions? Any help at all would be appreciated!


Tl;dr I submitted a major project 15 minutes late by a stupid mistake. I fail automatically because of it, despite my grades in the class. Any way of fixing or negating the F? Or is this just gonna have to be a hard lesson learned?

Edit: I didn't realize retaking classes would replace the prior grade in the class so I'll just do that! Thanks for the help all.

So, for background I recently turned 21, and am a few years completely removed from the school experience. I moved into a new area recently and found the school in my state that would be my absolute #1 choice. It has the culture, location, and programs that I would look for, along with in-state tuition and a very very high rank in the field I want to major with as bonuses. When I say this school has literally everything I look for in a school, I mean it.

My high school transcript was FAR below what the school normally takes (mostly due to depression and laziness at the time) but I got BLESSED to get offered a guaranteed transfer after I studied for a good SAT score and had good activities. 

The Issue comes in this fall 2022 semester. I needed 30 credit hours and certain classes by June 2023 to complete the transfer, so I found a community college that offers all of the classes in my state around the summertime (late I know, I wasn't taking it seriously because I knew a bunch of schools that still accepted applications late summertime even into early august). Due to applying so late I registered for all the classes I needed but didn't know I needed to test into a certain class (let's just call it MATH 1) if I didn't take the class in high school. Mind you, I need to take MATH 1 and MATH 2 for the transfer. A couple days go by with me calling the person in charge of testing because I had a ton of questions I needed answered about the process and getting voicemail every call, and I decide ""eh its whatever, I can take MATH 1 at a different school come spring 2023 and test into MATH 2 at the school I currently go to and just take them both the same semester. I thought I had everything figured out until I get an email a few hours ago saying, ""hey btw if you don't pay $1,600 by tomorrow 1pm your entire schedule will be deleted"", and funnily enough, the website where you can see all of your fees and loans etc is completely down? or something? I can't access it, and I won't be able to call until tomorrow because the school is closed. A lot of thoughts went through my mind ""I had already filled out the FAFSA shouldn't the school know I'm paying with that?"" ""Even if I paid with money, I don't have Id still have the MATH 1 problems"" etc etc etc. And yeah, I know that these questions have answers I would've known if I didn't rush. But I did, so I was completely ignorant.

I honestly just screwed myself over ROYALLY. I just wanted to enjoy my last free couple of days in summer, apply for a community college, and do the coursework they give me. But because I rushed the whole process, I didn't realize a TON of extra stuff that I needed to prepare for and handle WAY ahead of time. Even if there was a way to salvage my fall 2022, because I was so rushed and last minute, I barely know how to navigate the 50 different portals they gave me, which is frustrating because the actual coursework (at least what I've seen of it) is even easier than I thought it would be. Not to mention that I still barely know about the financial aid process and how ANY of it works, along with a ton of other things about the college process in general. I would've taken it more seriously if it was the school I actually wanted to go to, but it wasn't, so I really rushed the entire process. It was dumb of me.

I think at this point I only have 3 solutions (that I know of).

* Try to find another school that's still accepting fall 2022 (23 days into august lol) and start the process over
* Say screw it and forget fall 2022 and forget this school. Get a job and work until spring 2023, quit my job (because I live with family so I can do that) and enroll in 2 schools at once and work 30 credit hours. (Completely absurd workload but would solve my MATH 1 problem because I could take MATH 1 and MATH 2 at two different schools)
* Say forget the guaranteed transfer altogether. Enroll into a decent school I can actually get into, and Spring 2023 take regular course classes. Roll the dice as to whether I actually get into my first choice. (Absolutely the easiest option but I'd be throwing away one lucky break I had)

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly even if you don't have any advice to give me, thanks for reading because it felt good to type out. I'm normally a guy that can roll with all the punches and find a quick solution when I'm knocked off my feet, so it really sucks to just have to sit and accept that there aren't any quick fixes. I'm screwed because I was being an idiot.

prayerrequest,1328147035,/r/AskReddit/comments/p70u4/college_transfer_help_please/,"First of all I'm going to be upfront. If you don't agree with my beliefs or background please leave this alone. If there are people who can legitimately help me I will be grateful beyond belief. 

I'm a 20 year old third year college student that's has an Associate of Science from a North Texas community college. I actually attained my degree about a semester ago, but due to certain limitations, I wasn't able to transfer earlier. I'm still living with my mother and brothers in the same city that I graduated from as the cc is also in the same city, so I really feel like the time has come for me to take the next step and see what's out there. The reason that I wasn't able to transfer earlier is because I'm an undocumented student. I can't apply for financial aid so almost all of my tuition costs for the cc have come out of my own pocket through hard work, dedication and most of all, the help of God. Stay with me here. 

My family and I have lived a rough life but we're just thankful to be alive and have a place we can call home. Those hardships we underwent though, have scarred us and it's been very difficult to live a ""normal"" life. Last year, my mom found out that due to those hardships, including domestic violence and sexual abuse, we were eligible to apply for something called the ""U-Visa"" where the country recognizes our hardships and grants us a work permit that will allow us to work legally in the U.S. It was like a miracle sent directly from God. We had just been counting on the Dream Act to pass so we could just continue our educations but this was...idk...a miracle. 

The thing is, we filed our application last June but it takes a while for the USCIS to grant our acceptance or not so now we're just waiting to see what happens. I rest my entire faith on God that everything will go well. As I stated before, I already have my A.S. and really, really want to attend either UT Austin or TWU this fall but I have to be really careful with the application process as it could jeopardize the visa process. UT's been my dream school ever since high school, and with the visa, I'd be able to graduate and actually be able to apply for a job afterwards, unlike many other undocumented students who often graduate but are later stuck due to a lack of S.S. 

But now *I'm* stuck. Idk what to do. UT's an expensive school and their Fall 2012 deadline is coming up soon. If I apply and get accepted, I'd still have to wait for the permit decision. If I get granted the permit, I will be able to apply for FASFA and other scholarships/grants which I otherwise would've been unable to do so as an undocumented student. If I don't, Texas has it's own state version known as the TASFA which would help me but I can't make a decision until the permit comes since it could interfere with the decision. I *could* apply either way, but I would just wait to apply for financial aid later on and perhaps have to get a loan. Would y'all recommend me to apply and wait for the financial aid or just not apply at all and wait for the permit? My mom thinks it wouldn't be a bad idea to wait another year, perhaps work, and then go from there but I already feel like wasted enough time.

 Another thing, I'm still unsure between UT or TWU. To make it short: TWU is closer, has the actual program I want (Occupational Therapy), and allows me to transfer more credits. What I don't like is that it's a bit too close. I really want to get out there, make more friends and have that ""college experience."" On the other hand, UT's perhaps a bit more recognized that TWU, it's right in the middle of downtown Austin, the campus is beautiful, and graduating from there would make me and my family really proud. But it's expensive, they don't have an OT program (I was thinking a BS in Natural Sciences instead), it's further, and they only accept 60 transferable hours. I have no idea what to do. I could go to UT, get my BS, then transfer back to TWU afterwards since the OT program is at a Master's level anyway but, oh I just don't know what to do. Guys I know this is a lot...I know that whatever happens will be God's work and it will be the BEST thing for me but ANY information, help, advice, or related stories would help!!! Thank you so much and have an AWESOME day!!! :)

miggy621,1614308478,/r/socialwork/comments/lsoa5q/having_second_thoughts/,"Hi all -- I hope everyone is hanging in as best as you all can, right now. I have been working in the social work/social services industry for a little over four years and was recently accepted to an MSW program. I am awaiting my financial aid package, but have enrolled in the program but am having some pretty intense second thoughts about moving forward with this plan

Basically, I have been experiencing pretty intense burnout the last couple of months. In all, my workplace is super fair in managing our workloads, I get paid better than most other similar positions, and they have been really accommodating in giving us stipends to build out our home offices and giving us time off to deal with the stress of the pandemic. 

Prior to working at this job, I was working at a community health center and I was making considerably less money. I took that job mostly out of desperation; I had moved to a different city after some pretty intense family stuff happened that I needed to distance myself from. I was driving Lyft full-time, and barely making ends meet. It was a hot mess; my car was almost repossessed, my student loans defaulted, and I didn't have health insurance for almost a year (as you can imagine, I was really struggling with anxiety and panic attacks during this time). 

Eventually, I got myself out of that hole (I had to work two jobs pretty much the entire time I worked there) and moved back to the area that I'm from (the family issues have calmed down and now we are on our \~healing journey\~) and began working at my current job. The pandemic caused me to move back in with my family (I was renting an apartment nearby but it was too small for non-stop remote work) and I have been fortunate enough to be able to save up money for the first time in my entire life. I have rehabbed my debt issues, my credit score has gone up, etc... and I feel so much less stressed and never ever want to feel like I did a couple of years ago (side note: it is unbelievable what our bodies will do when exposed to that amount of stress. I kept joking with my Mom at the start of the pandemic that I was sleeping so much because I was finally able to sleep soundly for the first time in 5 years).

While the conditions of my current job are adequate (I have heard horror stories from friends in other non-profit spaces throughout the pandemic), I just feel so burnt out by the work. Constantly feeling like I have no ability to actually make changes or impacts (I work in housing services in a huge and expensive city lol), having a difficult time building trust with clients who think that we aren't offering apartments to them for one reason or another when it's literally just that there are no apartments, and the bureaucratic red-tape of social services (a fun example would be the city agency that administers housing vouchers literally failing to renew a client's voucher and then being impossible to get in contact with, resulting in the client accruing a $10k balance because of their error!!!). I feel like I am banging my head up against a wall every day, and feel like the burn out is impacting my ability to do very simple things like read e-mails properly or complete data entry. 

(Also, don't even get me started on how annoying it is to work with landlords... that is a different thread entirely)

I guess my ambivalence now comes from whether or not I will be able to recover from this burnout and pivot to something more fulfilling by going back to school. Additionally, due to my student debt from undergrad (I have private loans that cannot be deferred because they are run by the literal devil), health insurance premiums, and my car payment, I will burn through my savings pretty quickly while I am in school. I am so traumatized from the last time I was flat broke that I worry about going back to school and ending up in that place again, especially if end up making less money than I earn now if I decide to go the clinical route. 

In the past, I have toyed with going into an operations/project management/account manager role within the healthcare field (I did something similar for a year after graduating college and really enjoyed some aspects of that work). I also really enjoy writing (I have published some stuff here and there and am taking grantwriting courses right now), so I feel like I could combine these things to do something else, but I genuinely don't know even where to begin. Any advice/guidance or even validation that it's okay to feel this way would be very appreciated.

I have had some really wonderful experiences working within this field, and I have met some of the most selfless and kind people throughout the process, and I appreciate all you do to help care for people &amp; communities.

I still go to see him when my sister goes, because I don't want her to be left alone with him, so I see him at least every second weekend.


So basically, he is ruining my life. I don't mean to sound like a whiny, pathetic teen, this is true. I have panic attacks on a regular basis, and I first attempted suicide when I was still in primary school. He's emotionally abusive, he's mentally unwell, and he's a drug user. The main issue is the emotional abuse. He basically had me convinced as a child that if I didn't do exactly what he wanted, he wouldn't love me anymore. For years he's been periodically calling me up and telling me that he hates me, never wants to see me again, and then he leaves for months. When he comes back he always apologizes, and says he'll never do it again. I'm terrified of him, as is my sister. Almost since I can remember I haven't slept well, I've always felt on edge, and now my hair is actually falling out. When he calls me, I sometimes have to run to the bathroom to vomit.


So the other night, my sister called him to ask what was happening on the weekend. He has custody of her and had previously said that he'd pick her and I up and take us to his place on Saturday morning. Apparently he'd forgotten. He screamed at her down the phone for a good 5 minutes, and then told her that she could walk to his place, for all he cared. She's 14, and we live about 80kms (50miles) apart. She was in tears for hours.


That was a day ago. He hasn't responded to my calls. It's 12:40am, Saturday now, and he usually shows up at about 5am on the way home from work. I don't know if he's going to show up, and I don't know what he's going to do if he does. Part of me wants to forgive him and take the path of least resistance, like I always have, but I know that can't go on forever.


I want to tell him to get out of my life, and to get out of my sister's life, but I don't know if I can. I am a coward, and I've never been able to stand up to him once. I also am worried about him. Even though he's horrible sometimes, he's my dad, and I love him. I know he can't help being mentally ill. He has no friends, and ever since he and my mother divorced when I was 7, he has told me that I am his only friend, and if I stop talking to him he'll hang himself. I don't know if I can deal with that, but I also don't want my sister to have to deal with that. I know it's ridiculous, but she'll see it as if she is responsible, as her phone call was the catalyst in this situation, and I would do anything rather than have her feel like she's had a hand in her dad's death.


Also, he's paying child support for my sister. If he takes off again, or dies, that stops. My sister earned a half-scholarship to a very prestigious private school, but even with the half-scholarship, the fees are very expensive, and without dad's help, my mother won't be able to afford them, and my sister will have to move schools. She'd be devastated, and I don't want to take this opportunity away from her. She's so smart, she deserves to go to the best school, and she earned her place. If I somehow work up the courage to tell my father where to shove it, I might jeopardize her place at the school.


I need to know what to do. I know I should be making the decision for myself, but I've been handling this shit for years. Years. I've been fielding his abusive phone calls, I've been tip-toeing around him, and doing everything to make him happy. I've been living my life on edge, because I know he follows me in his car when I'm going about my day. I've talked him down from the roof of our house when he was going to jump. I cannot do this anymore. I am not capable of dealing with this, and I cannot make this decision. I feel like my mind is falling apart, and for once, I just need someone to make the decision for me, to tell me what I should do. I'd appreciate *any* help. *Any* help. It's now 12:52am, and he may be here at 5:00am.",AskReddit,"Reddit, I need some help figuring my life out.

Brian-the-Burnt,1651675845,/r/college/comments/ui8chl/im_39_i_just_finished_my_first_degree_after_a_25/,"I set a goal to finish my first degree before my 40th birthday, and now that final grades have posted, I can officially say that I am a college graduate with an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming. My final semester was 25 credit hours and consisted of the following courses:

* **Assessment Prep 1CR** - this is a 1-credit course that is essentially a big study group in order to earn some industry certification related to our field. It depends on your major, i.e. Networking majors will take CompTIA Network+, and so forth.
* **C# Programming (with lab) 4CR** 
* **Java Programming (with lab) 4CR**
* **C++ Programming (with lab) 4CR** - this one was probably my hardest class the whole time I've been in school thus far. Pointers are welcome to return to hell at their earliest convenience. The exams were also extremely difficult in this class.
* **SQL Programming (with lab) 4CR** 
* **Windows Operating System: Client (with lab) 4CR** - relatively easy, but a ton of assignments. This one was integrated heavily with the TestOut Windows Client Pro course.
* **Microsoft Office Applications (with lab) 4CR** - relatively easy elective because the rest was quite heavy.

I was able to finish this semester with a 4.0 GPA by having no life whatsoever. I don't recommend this for most people because it was hard. Really hard. And I didn't go from 12 credits to 25 the next semester, either. I started with 17, 11 (summer, so accelerated 8-week classes), 21, 25. The ramp up helped me find my tolerance levels and get experience in what I could handle as I went. 25 was *almost* too much; I finished with a 4.0, but C++ was a weak A the whole second half of the semester.

As I mentioned, I wanted to finish up my first degree before my 40th birthday, which was about 2 years from when I started. After I started, I decided I wanted to go faster, and then I decided I wanted two degrees. I've finished one and finish the other when they offer my last class to complete the program in Fall 2022 (AAS Software Engineering).

I have been accepted at Oregon State University in the Computer Science program, so that's the next step on the journey. I'm still in the process of getting everything together for admissions, filling out scholarship applications, and so forth, but I hope that a lot of my credits will satisfy transfer equivalency because non-resident university is much more expensive than resident community college.

If no one has any questions or comes here looking for my experiences as an adult student going back to college after many years, here goes:

* You're only too old if you decide you're too old.
* You will feel like the old guy/gal in class, and you will think people are judging you. *They are.* That's what people do. Not all of them, but you know. **Focus on the goal.**
* Older people are scared to go back because they are afraid their ""old"" brain won't be able to handle new information. Nonsense. You just need to start using those parts that you haven't been using. Much of what you did will come back, and you'll learn a lot more.
* Take a degree that you can use to enhance your life, your career, or that you can use to get a better career, and don't throw yourself deep into debt. As an adult learner, you have an advantage in budgeting, finance, and life experience. **Use those skills and make it happen.**
* You're older, and long experience has revealed everything you like and everything you don't. You're in a great position compared to most college students because you know what majors fit you, or at the very least, you can throw out the majors you know you will hate with cheetah speed.
* This is so important that I'll say it again. **FOCUS ON THE GOAL** I've had the self-doubt, the questioning, the imposter syndrome, the depression, and everything else that comes along with it. This is a major change in your life. It's going to be weird sometimes.
* And my biggest excuse before I started, and I told myself this for years: *It just takes **so long** to get a degree. I'll be X age when I finish.* So? And once you get started, it goes quicker than you think. Think of how fast time has flown up to this point and then tell me that a couple years is too long. And besides, I finished one degree and I'm one class short on another after 3 full terms and one summer session. If it's too long for you, there are ways to speed it up.

If anyone has any questions or needs advice, ask away. If not and you just came to read the story, thank you for taking time out to hear my story. And since most here are also in college, I want to wish you the best of luck in your education, your career to follow, your exams if you haven't finished them all yet, and your life going forward. &lt;3",college,"I'm 39.

ScaryFaces,1429149834,/r/college/comments/32raff/only_16_days_left_to_make_a_decision_and_im_stuck/,"SO. I've basically narrowed it down to 3 very different schools, and I can't seem to pick one. Don't get me wrong, I'm not letting reddit decide for me which college to go to; I just want some advice or experiences. 

**So here's the deal:** 

- I don't know what I want to major in (could honestly be anything, preferably something challenging), but I'm considering engineering as a possible option. 

- I'm very fortunate, as my parents have said that they will be able to pay for my entire undergrad education, but I am a bit uncomfortable with the thought of taking so much their hard-earned money, especially if it's not going to lead to anything worthwhile. 

- I live in a smallish suburb in Maryland, where at least half of my school and half of my county is attending UMD. I *really* want to get the hell out of here and reinvent myself/start something new. 

**The colleges:**

1.) Northeastern University

- Pros: Their co-op program is EXTREMELY good, and I feel like I can easily get a job after graduation. Also, living in a city would be interesting and a, hopefully, pleasant change of scenery compared to the suburbs. Their undeclared program (which I got accepted into) would also definitely help with the whole *oh god what am I going to do with my life* thing, and it is a smaller school population wise (compared to my other colleges) as well. I also really like the whole ""vibe"" of the college, as well as the campus. 

- Cons: Although I'm not sure this is necessarily bad, but it has a less traditional college feel (no Greek life, football, and the small campus is basically integrated into the city). Students leaving for co-ops, along with the fact that there isn't really much of a campus/social scene (at least not until you're 21) could make it intimidating to make new friends, especially for someone really shy and introverted like me. Lastly, it would cost ~$50,000 per year to attend, almost doubling the costs of my state school. 

2.) University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign

- Pros: I was accepted into their engineering undecided program, and their engineering program is VERY prestigious, and like I said before, I'm considering doing engineering, but I'm not really sure about it. The campus is also extremely large; there's a lot to do, and with a population of 40,000 people, I'm sure that I'll be able to make friends with someone. Basically, it's an all around great school, especially for engineering, and I'll be far away from Maryland. 

- Cons: I know how this might sound and it's kinda irrational, but there are A LOT of Asian international students at UIUC. When I visited, I did not see a single Asian student hanging out with anyone other than their groups of other Asian students. Being Asian, I feel like there might be some stigma associated with being Asian, as people might just shrug me off as another typical international student who doesn't speak English. Again, probably irrational. Furthermore, because the campus and populations are so big, I feel like they might be *too* big and I won't be able to receive any individual attention. I also am not sure I even want to do engineering, so being in their engineering undecided program might have negative consequences. Lastly, this school also costs ~$50,000 per year. 

3.) University of Maryland - College Park

- Pros: I save my parents a ton of money by going to this school (around $100,000); the cost is only $24,000 per year. UMD is a *great* and very well rounded school with many of their programs, such as engineering and business, ranked very highly. The campus is a pretty good size and there would probably be lots of social activities there with its traditional ""college experience."" I am also in the general studies program. 

- Cons: As I've said before, I really want to start over and go somewhere new, and a part of me feels like that will never happen if I go to UMD. ""But UMD is a big school! I'm sure you probably won't see most of your classmates from your high school anyways!"" It's not even the fact that a lot of people from my class are going, but it's that  I've gotten sick of the whole ""vibe"" of my county and area, and I just want to leave everything behind. I'm also not particularly fond of the campus; I think it's kinda ugly. However, UMD is still a really good school and is near the DC area, which is great for employment, and in all honesty, I probably wouldn't even be *that* miserable if I went there.

I completely understand if you guys are sick of the constant stream of ""REDDIT WHERE SHOULD I GO TO COLLEGE"" posts and downvote this, or if you guys don't want to read this giant wall of text -because honestly, I wouldn't either-.

[deleted],1352596848,/r/AskReddit/comments/12zmkd/ive_been_job_hunting_since_may_and_havent_had_an/,"Hi Reddit,

I’m a first time poster, though my fiancé is a longtime redditor. I have never before felt such a strong need to air out my frustrations to strangers, but, here goes.


I found out in May that my job was going to vanish at the beginning of August. My company is a good one, however, and they tried to place me elsewhere, to the point where they had me stay on as a temporary assistant  in another department, meaning I was actually employed through to the end of August. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out. 


I worked in a small industry, and I have a lot of contacts within it. Despite all this, I haven’t had an interview since a week before I became unemployed. I have been putting out resumes nearly every day, in my industry and others. I’m on LinkedIn and Career Builder and Monster. The only calls or e-mails I’ve gotten (the ones that aren’t automated, that is) have been scams. Luckily, I’ve caught on before I wasted any time with them.


I’m feeling down and out. My lease is up at the end of the month. My mother wants me to move back in with her and ditch my fiancé, who has been fighting with depression and hasn’t managed to finish college yet because of it. He’s in debt, like anyone else who went to school. However, he’s fighting through it, and he’s going to finally finish up this coming semester. We plan on moving away from NYC to someplace less expensive where dear friends have offered us a place to stay while we get back on our feet. Moving is becoming a fiasco, because we need to store furniture that will not fit in our friend’s home. I can’t even get into the stress I’m under because of all of this and watching the money I had saved up slowly dwindling away because I’m unemployed.


And then there’s the job hunt. I keep plugging away at it. I’ve signed up with  headhunting websites; they send me jobs I’m not remotely qualified for. Any job I’d be interested in outside my original purview—even the entry-level positions—is asking for upwards of a year of experience in their particular industry: marketing, social media, publicity, evens some administrative positions. I’m a loyal employee. I’m smart, honest, and I go out of my way to learn things that will make me more efficient at my job—and I will teach those things to others. I have management and customer service experience. I can work Excel, Wordpress, I know basic HTML and CSS, and I’m on top of social media. I write exceptionally well. All I really want is a fair wage, a vaguely 5-9 Monday-Friday schedule, and the occasional time off. If someone would give me a chance, I would put my entire heart and soul into working for them. I’m sick and tired of writing soulless cover letters; I want to go completely nuts with them like letters from Joey Comeau’s ""Overqualified."" 


I don’t know what employers want from me. If they don’t interview me, they’ll never see how passionate I can be. If I don’t write the stale letter, I don’t even know if they’ll look at my resume. It feels like my applications get sucked into the void when I submit one online, but nowadays you’re not allowed to call a company, or drop off a resume in person, that just irritates people. My resume has been reviewed and edited by an excellent outplacement/career change service. There’s nothing more I can do with it—I have only had two jobs. My LinkedIn profile has recommendations from people who were major moves and shakers in my industry, and I have a stellar letter from my ex-boss explaining how she had wanted to promote me but couldn’t because of budget reasons. 


With all the rest of the stress just piling on and piling on, all I want to know is what else can I do? Is the only option for me falling back into the pit of retail work? Would I even manage to get a job there, since I’m wildly overqualified for it now? I want to work, and I’m willing to work HARD. If I was suddenly offered a job tomorrow, I would bound into the office with glee. Heck, if it paid enough, I would pay back the unemployment the state had given me over this tumultuous period of my life. Every day, every scam phone call, every time I get a rejection e-mail without having an interview, every day closer to the end of my lease and needing to move I’m losing more hope. I can only see more struggling in the future. I’m fighting for something better, but there are days when I don’t know if I’ll ever see the light at the end of this tunnel.


I don’t know if what I need is help or advice or encouragement or what. My fiancé has been supportive, and he’s kept me from losing my mind entirely, but the more I fret, the more pressure he feels, too.

Mordraken,1341777700,/r/AskReddit/comments/w8ets/as_a_23yearold_college_sophomore_i_have_been/,"Not entirely sure this belongs in AskReddit, but it's a question that I would like to ask a large base of people... so here goes:

So in 2006 I dropped out of HS about 4 months from graduation because my family was verbally abusive and otherwise absent from my life.

I moved away from home, found a job, and worked for a while before deciding that I wanted to do more with my life. So I got my GED, and got into college. I started my first semester in January 2010, and everything was great. But it wasn't meant to last.

The first time I filed my FAFSA I went back home to my grandparents' (My 53 year old father lives with his 68 year old mother) and basically *forced* my father to sign the paperwork. I filled everything out for him because he wasn't going to. All he had to do was sign it, and it still took me about 3 weeks to get him to do it.

But all was well, because the information was in on time, my EFC (Estimated Familial Contribution... or how much the college expects my family to pay) was $0. Financial Aid + Loans was enough to cover my living expenses + school. I had a 3.0GPA after my first semester of college. I was happy.

That's where the good times ended. Every single year since then (I now live about 6 hours away from my Grandparents/Dad) my financial paperwork has gotten later, and later. And each time I get less and less aid. I remind him months in advance, email/fax him paperwork that's all filled out and just waiting for a signature. They need his tax information, which he doesn't file until early April if at all.

He makes less than $5,000 a year because he doesn't work real jobs, and when he is working he either quits, or doesn't get paid by his sketchy employers. So I can't expect anything from him, and my grandparents are living on retirement.

Ever since that first golden semester I've had at least 50% less money from the government to go to school meaning that I've been working at least 30 hours a week to maintain a *barely* full-time schedule. It's taken a toll on my grades so far, dropping me down to a 2.1 overall GPA.

This last semester I ended up working 70 hours a week just to pay for my living expenses and bare necessities, including sparing money for my family when I could. My mother is constantly asking for money which she always promises to pay back but never does. Back on topic though, working 70 hours a week, and trying to take 12+ semester hours (That's ~60 hours of school work per week, according to the school expectations) is killing me.

I'm now deep in loan debt, and my grades continue to suffer. I owe my roommate $3,000 because he kept me afloat when I was down. I owe my ex girlfriend $3,000 because she was helping me when I couldn't afford to eat and pay for classes.

I want to finish my degree more than anything, but right now I'm in a situation where I can't file my own FAFSA without at least one parent, and my mother is trying to avoid it since she owes the IRS money. So it's relying on my King-of-procrastination father to get me the aid I need since I can't file as an independent until I'm 24 (next April).

What do I do? 

* Working and trying to go to school is killing my grades.

* Cutting my school hours to part-time cuts my already low Aid in half

* Cutting my school hours to less-than-full-time means I have to start paying loans back (something I'd have to work even more to do)

* Relying on my parents to fill out their part of the FAFSA is absolutely useless. And I can't file as an Independent until I'm 24 (April 2013)

* I can't afford to drop out, because it'll mean I have to start paying back loans, but I can't afford to stay in school because I don't have enough money.

* I need a degree to do what I want to do (Run a large scale Convention, build life-size above ground ""Dungeons"" and create a functional D&amp;D/LARP system that works, hire actors to be monsters, etc etc... I need a business degree and to make the right contacts)

* I'm in a really bad bind right now because I owe my friends money for supporting me the past year and a half, but all of my money is getting poured into trying to stay afloat, and in school.


Everything would be fine if I could just get my financial aid information in on time. My EFC is $0, I would be completely clear to just focus on school... but I can't do that until I file for next year's aid.

I don't know who I am. No, I don't have amnesia. I just had a deep, deep revelation. Let me give you some background info:

I am in my mid-20, I live in the Capital city of a Latinamerican country. I went to the good, preppy expensive schools, that teach you that good, old American Capitalism (No. I'm not a Commie.), I flunked out and transferred to a lesser, but still expensive school. I graduated and am in my 3rd year of college, majoring in Public Relations. I have many good, caring and trustworthy friends, who look up to me as a young man, with serious ambitious political aspirations. I have brothers, sisters, mother, father. All loving. All caring. 

Ideal life, one might say... 

I am very high right now. On marijuana. And I just got back from having sex with a pregnant prostitute, 8 months into her term. Without a condom. While high. Just for the hell of it. On the way back I had an epiphany. 

Let me put it this way: I do things. Bad things. Weird things. I portray myself as somebody to my friends, family and society in general and I am a very different and dark person deep down inside. 

I'm am calling this my Confessional. I am going to tell you all everything that I have done, that nobody else knows, because I won't dare tell ANYBODY that knows me. But, I need to know who I am. Or what I am.

I am going to list some things that I have done. Along the way, with the questions and the comments, I will give more information about myself and also list more things that I have done.

- From the age of 18, I have engaged in numerous sexual acts with various prostitutes. Without protection.

- I have stolen various amounts of money from friends, family, co-workers, employers and complete strangers. Since I was 14

- I have experimented with men. Sexually. (Duh.)

- I have a witty and charming sense of humor, actual public charisma. I know how to speak in public. Eloquently. 

- I had my first girlfriend at the age of 18. Whore. I regret it. I had my first sexual experience at the age of 14, when I paid our 5-month old pregnant maid $5 so that I could have sex with her. 

- I am highly intelligent. 

- I lie for no apparent reason. I have lied to everyone I know. 

- I have fantasied about killing people. Ex-girlfriends. While having sex. DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL.

- I have FREQUENTLY put myself in high risk behavior. 

- I don't consider my self a neat freak. But, I am sort of a slob. 

- My friends believe me. They believe IN me. 

- I was physically beaten and abused by my father. I have been threatened to death with a gun by my mother. 

- I have fantasied my life as a billionaire. With power. Leader of millions. 

- I have a giant ego. I am selfish. I am vain. 

- I have a foot fetish. I have a pregnancy fetish. I have masturbated with imagining dead women, pregnant ex-girlfriends and my sister's pregnant photographs. Not at the same time. 

- I buy things I don't need.

- I talk to everybody.

- I have been getting high very frequently as of two months ago. I used cocaine, too. 

- I see my self as a future leader in my country. A Messiah. A reformer. Someone that the people will love. Someone that the people will respect. Someone that the people will fear. 

- I consider myself a Moderate Conservative. Tough on crime. Liberal in social issues. 

- My father is a civil engineer and a Evangelical pastor. I went to church unwillingly until I was 14. I don't know him. I don't know about his family, past, childhood. He doesn't smoke or drink. He doesn't like music or dance. He's very charming and eloquent. I inherited that from him. He repeatedly beated me. I didn't speak to him for 2 years. He thinks I'm a slacker. An idiot. 

- My family has a dark background everyone seems to know. Except me. 

- I sometimes don't know why I do things.

This has all happened since I've been in Florida for a little more than a year.

I've changed friend groups 2-3 times since ive moved to Florida from Illinois but along with 2 original friends 1 from back home and my roommate being still with me as well, that doesn't seem to bad but I'll meet new people and become friends or aquantinces but over time slowly dislike certain things that makes it not as enjoyable being around them. I'm still friends with some of them but it just makes me unwilling to want to go out and do things with them. It also sucks trying to hang out with girls when I have a lot on my mind and it always just ends up being awkward and weird.

I've been talking to this girl for about a week, second girl I've tried talking to since I've been here and we've hung out once, it was somewhat an awkward experience. It was with some of my friends and it was the first time she met me and my friends in one sitting haha. and a bunch of randoms came over who were friends of friends and they ended up getting drunk and smoking a lot of weed. I wasn't very comfortable with it even though she knows I smoke and doesn't mind (or so she says) We went by ourselves to go to get pet stuff and it wasn't as awkward one on one.

Not to mention after assessing it, it seems like we are both in it to be happy considering she has her own problems at her apt and doesn't have any friends here and we are aware of each others situations...I feel as this could be another burden I've put upon myself, but I really want to help her out considering she is moving in a couple months. 

 I've went from wanting to be involved in the music business to psychology, almost instantly, (I picked up on it a little before I decided it's what I'm most interested in though) which to me is a big change to undertake. I believe I could continue on with studying psychology considering I find it more interesting than anything else I've ever done, and I enjoy learning about human behavior and such.

 It seems as if I do spend a lot on stuff I don't need, not that everyone else does as well, but i've been cutting down on it, I bought a drum set I don't play and a guitar that I can't even play. and eat out a lot and other various items. But I just tend to impulsively buy things to make me happy for a while but they don't last very long.

I'm usually irritated at something, something my friends do, random stuff that comes up, half the time I'm irritated with myself cause I feel as if I'm not doing anything productive but when I do do productive things I feel great but really shitty when I don't. I get anxiety about my situation and where I'm heading. I smoke marijuana do calm me down sometimes, but not excessively stoner like. I used to though and its just these small things I'm trying to change slowly.

I go from being happy to content to being worried and down about something all the time, it sucks.

   I tend to act different with my friends back home than I do with my friends back here, and I don't like meeting new people cause I think they aren't going to like who I normally am, and I don't like changing how I act to try to impress new people and it leaves me unmotivated to try and build relationships.

I don't get uncontrollably angry or anything and when I do get angry I do just keep it to myself because I don't want it to seem like an asshole because I'm really calm and try to be as nice as possible because its better than being a dick to everyone for sure.

I don't have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of inflicting pain, except for getting tattoos, in which i only have 2 but plan on more. 

Basically my life is at a standstill and nothing is really going good its all either content or shitty. FML

Maybe i'm just letting other people influence me too much.

This sounds like either BPD or some type of depression...or hopefully just a phase i'll have to deal with.
I hope some of this made sense I seem to have trouble collecting my thoughts as well...
any suggestions?

RequirementHoliday96,1623552732,/r/college/comments/nyn57z/im_currently_a_sophomore_and_will_be_a_junior_in/," So I'm in 10th grade rn and will be in 11th by like, August/Sept. of this yr which is scary (time is passing by so fast noo.) I took the only AP offered by my school for 10th grade this yr - AP World History - and have an A in it (though we have to argue our grade so ig I'll see whether I get an A or B? If u get a B in an AP course it gets bumpd) and have had A's in every other class I've taken this yr. I didn't take the AP test for it this yr bc I've been having mental health struggles and didn't want to pay for it, will pay for my tests next yr. Wasn't sure if it mattered or not. I had all A's in freshman yr too with the exception of Geometry, wherein I had a B second semester. I'm signed up for AP English, AP Statistics, and AP Biology for junior yr alongside Spanish 3 and normal History (non-AP - I was initially signed up for the AP version but decided I didn't want to kill myself lol.)

I do think that I want to go into the medical field, am leaning toward nursing but feel like I haven't really had enough time to explore...? Am thinking i want medical field doe. I am mostly looking for advice on college apps, on how to cope w junior yr, etc. I know that the seniors had a v tough yr college-wise due to the pandemic and imagine that the juniors will unfortunately maybe have a tough yr too, even though it might be a bit better? I also need to know whether or not I'll have to take the SAT/ACT, I imagine I will bc I'm Class of 2023?

I'll list off my extracurriculars too if it helps:

\-Co founder of youth activist org in my city, am senior member and help lead one of our committees. We have over 2,000 followers on Instagram and planned protests last summer/plan protests. Have had some drama w one or two org members which made me consider quitting but I have ultimately decided that I actually, def won't. We started our work last summer (summer of 2020.)

\-I am also co-president of our youth activist club that we started at school to ensure we get people volunteer hours and summer opportunities. Started club this yr.

\-Completed Nursing Workshop (that is moreso geared toward college students but they let me in lol) and received a certificate (idk if my parents lost the certificate or not, it was virtual and during COVID so ig I could email the guy and ask for one again...? But I did learn a lot abt nursing)

\-Did track in freshman yr, wasn't able to really go far w it bc of COVID cutting our season short. Didn't do it this yr due to COVID fears. Intend on doing it next yr but might not be able to bc I'll need to be vaccinated and my mom is really weird abt the COVID vaccine, kind of up in the air, I do want to do it though?

\-I was president of BSU this yr but wasn't voted in, was appointed by club advisor. Have decided to not do it next yr even though I was also apart of it in freshman yr just bc there's some resentment there due to having had interpersonal drama w another co-president (due to me doing all of the work) and with our Treasurer, who has always bullied me even though I did her job for her

\-Am a part of summer program Girls Inc, joined it summer before my freshman yr. Have a job shadowing opportunity this summer - opportunities are volunteering at pre-school (which I wanted but might not be able to get bc my mom doesn't want me to get vaccinated,) and journalism opportunity (which I actually really don't want, is it going to kill my like chances?)

\- I want a nursing internship but probs won't be able to get that until next summer :( Everyone said I can't do it this yr bc of COVID

\-Was on racism sub committee appointed by City Council representatives to make suggestions for City Council

\-Am part of Youth Advisory Board, we work with SBHC to teach students about health-related topics. I did it this yr but it's on Mondays and \*might\* conflict w another extracurricular I have for next yr? I did enjoy it this yr and think I want to next yr, I joined this yr but it admittedly felt different than it might normally bc of COVID?

\-I was School Site council rep for my grade this yr, worked w the principal, was voted in by peers

\-Was nominated by BSU club advisor to do something called Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center and actually do like attend the meetings? They offer leadership seminars on certain days of the week, it seems interesting and you do it over summers too.

Vanilla_Vaporeon,1537209471,/r/college/comments/9gn00k/my_senior_year_feels_like_a_nightmare/,"I am in a very stressful situation right now because of my parents. I thought my senior year was supposed to be exciting and fun, but it is a total nightmare. They are hurting my mental health and my relationship with my bf, and I feel lost. Long story short my parents are divorced and do not get along at all. My family is completely fucked. My dad is very wealthy, and I do not like being around him since he is very narcissistic and can be abusive. (He is also involved in scientology but I won't get into that right now). He now tries to be a good dad by sending me money every month while I am a student. The only rule is that I have not been allowed to have a job while he gives me money.

 I am very grateful for this money, but the problem is that neither of my parents have really been helping me pay for school. Previously I have been secretly saving some of the money I get from my dad to pay off my loans later that my mom had set up for me, but I had to use it all up for this past year's tuition. It is my last semester of my senior year now, and my tuition has not been covered... AGAIN. I told my mom about it, and she told me that she ""forgot"" to set up loans for me or financial aid or whatever and its past the due date, but previously she had told me I don't qualify anymore since she got remarried to another rich guy. She basically told me its not her problem and to figure it out myself. My dad did pay for my summer internship class this past semester, but my parents had a huge fight about it first. He also just paid for a new laptop for me that he is forcing me to pay him back for, so I have a strong feeling he will say no to helping me and have another horrible fight over the phone with my mom, and my mom will probably resent me for it if he gets verbally abusive again. So now i'm scared I'm not going to make it to graduation.

On top of all this, I had to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate, and my mom told me to move back home. It has really put a strain on my relationship with my wonderful bf of 3 years too, since I lost some of my freedom to be with him whenever I want. We even secretly lived together for a year too and it was amazing. Anyway my mom is now always upset at me about little things that aren't even my fault most of the time, and wants me to pay rent. I would be fine with that, but my dad has started giving me way less money than usual every month so that she won't get any more of his money than the child support for my sister he barely pays. 

I really don't know what to do and my anxiety is just getting worse and worse. I am almost always crying about it if I am alone too long... especially when I need to be working on my artwork for my senior art show. My bf and I have been talking about moving into an apartment together after I graduate. Then I can get out of this mess of a family and hopefully go to grad school for my masters in graphic design, but I still have to make it another few months until then, and idk if I can even afford that... my mom also says she is totally on board with us moving together since she ""can't afford my lifestyle"" (whatever that means), even though she also always makes a point to tell me to NEVER marry him.  Its like even though my mom says she agrees, she also makes me doubt it will even work out by saying things like how my bf is not who she would have picked for me (what is this, the 1500s?) and how it will suck when we break up and are stuck living together. I know that is a possibility but it sucks that she has no faith in us, or anyones relationships really. She also just told me she asked my dad over the phone what he thinks about me and my bf living together and he said he does not approve at all and would cut off all money for me.

I am feeling completely lost right now and I don't know what to do anymore.  My parents are too selfish to help me with anything, but at the same time try to control me to the point where I feel every decision I make is wrong. I am just trying to graduate and be an adult and a professional artist, but I also have to deal with all this garbage.

I come from a heavily conservative Indian family, which means that while growing up, my parents have constantly been telling me that I need to study either medicine or engineering. From the moment I hit middle school, I faced a constant bombardment of IIT-JEE prep courses and general railroading towards the engineering world, especially as both of my parents are computer engineers. The catch? I've never been even remotely interested in medicine or engineering. From a young age, I've excelled at debate, which honed my research skills, analytical thinking, and policy exposure.

When I began applying to college, I had the chance to apply to some very prestigious universities. My grades were great, I'd gotten 5s on all my liberal arts AP tests (think APUSH, AP Gov, AP Lang etc), and I had the extracurriculars to back me up.

At the time, I was financially dependent on my parents for everything, and had little sense of independence. I put my head down, allowed myself to be bullied into submission, and said okay. Maybe engineering wouldn't be so bad, I told myself. Maybe I could study environmental engineering, and it would somewhat align with the goals I had envisaged for myself.  


My first year of college has been miserable. I managed to BS my way into a top engineering college on the East Coast, and I am struggling like I never have before. My grades have tanked because I am way out of my depth. Competing against kids who have studied multivariable calculus since the tenth grade and who are there because they want to be is both incredibly challenging and incredibly demoralizing.

To make matters worse, my university is divided into individual colleges.

I'm passionate about the environment, about political theory and analysis, and about civic engagement. I've recently been looking at withdrawing from the College of Engineering and reapplying to my university's College of Arts and Sciences, but I'm terrified that my low GPA disqualifies me from consideration. I've been looking at external academic forgiveness program at other universities, but I'm afraid my parents will cut me off financially and I won't be able to afford college anymore.  


I'm terrified, you guys. What do I do?  


Tl;dr - I want to study government but my parents have pushed me into engineering. Now I'm flunking college and I have no clue what to do.

jacobflores1,1635953571,/r/college/comments/qlx072/miserable_at_college/,"I'm currently a college freshman at a UConn regional campus (commuting from my parent’s house) studying Finance, on track to living on the main campus (Storrs) next semester. 

Currently, I'm having my good days &amp; bad days. I work 25-30 hours per week at my job &amp; go to class 15 hours a week. Add in studying, homework, etc. and it's closer to 60 hours per week, sometimes 70 hours if I'm prepping for an exam. It's pretty grindy, and I'm mostly ok with that. I've worked these kinds of hours before. However going into college this summer, I had aspirations of getting into a top MBA graduate school after undergrad, so a 3.7+ GPA was my goal. &amp; I’ve done somewhat well academically. Granted I have 3 very easy classes with no exams that will be guaranteed A's, but my Stat class &amp; Mircoecon class I've struggled through tremendously. Between these two classes, I've had 4 exams so far and the score has been: 70%, 64%, 60%, &amp; 83%. I feel like I'm very good at doing more grindy assignments, like bs homework and essays, but prepping for exams &amp; the actual test taking is what is killing me. Now granted this winter, work will end and I'll be able to focus on school full time come next semester. But as of now, my whole life feels like misery. I wake up and immediately have a knot in my stomach about the anxiety I have for the day. College just seems so much harder than HS &amp; it's overwhelming. I could end up with a 3.6 at the end of the semester, but I could end up also with more like a 3.2 if the exam scores continue in the direction they're going. &amp; if classes get harder next semester as I predict they may, my MBA aspirations may soon dry up. 

Last night I began studying for the 3rd Mircoecon exam and I didn't get too far. This exam covers around 100 textbook pages (4 chapters), and I sat there for 90 minutes at my desk only getting to the 3rd page, really struggling to understand basic concepts. I had the worst mental breakdown I had all semester, cried for about an hour, and gave up for the night, and just laid in bed texting my mom &amp; dad venting on how frustrated I felt. At that rate, it would take me 100 hours to solely read the textbook, not even properly study for the exam. 

Everyone at the main campus I know just seems to be partying all the time, and genuinely having a fun time. But for me, I feel like it's a race for me to get all my homework and other assignments completed, so I can free up some time to study for exams. I feel like school is consuming my whole life, and it certainly is something I think about almost constantly even when I'm not working on school work (at my job). I don’t have a gf, and I almost feel guilty trying to hang out with the few friends I have, because I feel like I should be studying. So there are very few things to look forward to at the moment, definitely playing this semester on hard mode. 

I'm wondering if I should take next semester off through a leave of absence, which allows my current 14 credits to stay. &amp; I have 7 credits from HS, and taking a couple of summer classes in the future years can still allow me to graduate in 4 years despite taking the semester off. This will technically give me time off from December 17-August 30. Throughout this period would I like to pursue entrepreneurship to see if I can maybe not need college altogether if I can do well with my business. I’ve bought 3 courses, and around 50 books this summer. A mentor I know used the same courses I have when he was 19 and was able to reach $10k per month with his amazon ad agency within 3 months working 10 hour days, 6 days a week. I'm tired of school. I’m not naturally good at it, and my passion for entrepreneurship makes me wonder if the bachelor's degree qualification will even matter for my success in the end. I don't want to play the school game, where I'm at UConn till I'm 23, work for a few years, get a top MBA (if I can even get it) at 29, and then work some mindless high paying job that in all honestly would never fulfill me. College is god awful, I technically feel like I can persevere. But it sure is a challenge for me and I feel incredibly miserable and unfulfilled. I hate taking classes that don't interest me, spending all my parent’s money on my tuition, and even though I study hard and learn, my exams test me more on my memorization &amp; I do poorly no matter how much prep is done.

pink_mango,1313689827,/r/AskReddit/comments/jmykq/reddit_not_sure_what_to_do_here_my_mom_owes_me/,"So a bit of back story. I live with my parents, I'm 24. Going back to school in October (which is why this is bothering me so much).

In March this year I got a large tax return back, told my parents. So I get the cheque and sent a happy ""Yay I got my money!"" text to my mom. Literally an hour later I get one back, ""I have a favour to ask"". Now my family has had money issues in the past. I would come home from school and our electricity had been turned off. Or our cable. Or there would be 5 voicemails saying ""please call us this is an urgent matter"" (ie give us our money). I new right away she wanted to borrow some money. I'd helped out in the past, and usually it was $100 here or there and I'd get my money back next pay cheque. No big deal. I have no issue helping my family out when they need. 

So she asked to borrow $1000. Wow that's a lot more than usual. I had been planning on spending my money on some RRSP's, and getting a few things for myself (at this point I didn't have the idea yet to go back to school) but all my bills were paid, so I decided to lend her the money. 

About 3 weeks or so later she asks to borrow money for hyrdo. Another $650. 

About a month after that, I come home to find the cable is out. Call the company. ""Oh you haven't paid your balance in months so we shut that off"". So I paid that. Another $650. 

So now the total balance that my mom has borrowed is about $2300. All my tax return gone. And I had also spent some of it myself, so I had to put some on my credit card. 

So after waiting patiently, and seeing nothing back, I ask her when she thinks she can start to pay me back. ""soon"" ""next week"" or no answer at all are the only replies I get. (Let's keep in mind that I HATE confrontation and feel terrible bringing it up in person so all of this is done through texting. The wrong way to do it, I know.)

So in June she pays me back $1000. ""Yay!"" I think. Looks like she's getting back on track and I can have all my money back soon. 

Now it's the middle of August and I haven't seen any more. I ask her every two weeks when she can pay me back. I don't even get answers any more. The last time she answered me, I was in a snippy mood and told her to stop beating around the bush, I would like to know a date of when I can get at least *some* of it back. Her reply, ""I don't beat around the bush, I have no idea what you're talking about,"" yet didn't say anything about when she could pay me back. 

Reddit, this is starting to cause me a lot of stress. I start school in a month and a half, full time, and will only be working once a week. I need my freaking money back. 

Meanwhile, throughout this whole ordeal, she keeps spending. Spending. Spending. I come home and she's bought my cousin some new tshirts. She's buying little nick nack things all the time. Etc Etc. This may sound stupid, but if you owe your child money, would it not make sense to stop buying stupid useless shit that you don't need?? 

My dad has gone camping 3 times since March. He eats out at the bar at least once a week (drinking there as well) and probably ends up spending $100 a weekend (conservatively) on booze and eating at bars. I don't think that he knows my mom borrowed money from me though. But my dad doesn't have a debit card, my mom gives him money weekly. She would be able to say to him, I'm sorry but we can't afford this right now. (He honestly has no idea about finances. When I was in high school and my mom went away for the weekend, I asked him for a few bucks because I was going out with some friends. He gave a 15 year old $60 for the weekend. I said, ""umm yeah thanks"" and took it and ran before he realized she usually only gave me $20. Then laughed about it afterwards)

So this is what I'm wondering...what do I do? Can anyone offer me any advice? I'm tired of this. I'm tired of being stressed out. I have no problem helping...but this is getting excessive. If you are running out of money and can't pay your bills, wouldn't it make sense to scale back your spending? So that you *can* pay your bills eventually?

Am I being rude for thinking like this? It's put a bit strain on our relationship. I just want things to be happy again.

I went from being a first year student in an intensive four-year biochemistry program at an undergraduate christian university to taking two really easy classes at my local community college. I also had my first panic attack in college after deciding this. During my first year of college I made a lot of good friends, *failed pretty much every class I had,* learned way more about myself and how I think then ever before, changed my spiritual/philosophical views pretty hard, and gradually changed from the optimistic/relaxed person I had always been, into a depressed and anxious individual. 

Now I work 20-30 hours a week at a local Wendy's and am a part time student at my community college. I'm unsure of what I want to do, but I've changed my dream from biochemistry researcher to psychotherapist. I love science, love music, and enjoy helping people through their emotional problems. I think I've found the right thing for me at last, but after having a rather terrible start to this semester (skipping classes, not doing homework, several all nighters, etc.) I think that I just can't work with the academic world until I have my mental/personal issues worked out. 

Also even after finally taking my ADHD seriously for the first time in my life, my psychiatrist hasn't really done much to help me (ok the meds were nice I'll admit), nor do I think he will do anything more. He says he thinks I should seek a psychotherapist (weird how that works out) and I'm currently looking for one right now.

So I want to officially get out of academia and work full time, until I'm ready to go back to college. **If that's enough information for you, then go ahead and comment, but if you want some more info on the situation, feel free to look at a LOOOONG list of pros and cons I typed out.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 1. I owe nearly 20,000 in student loans that I'm currently paying a small interest off of. Both the government and state of New Jersey will spike up the interest rates on my loans like crazy (ok really more the state of NJ, man this state sucks) if I don't attend a college at least part time.           

2. I can't get a refund anymore for this fall semester, I owe what I owe and I have to finish paying off my payment plan (at least its a community college tuition and not uber expensive private christian university tuition) whether I finish the semester until December or not.

3. Let us address the fact that I am an impulsive, anxious person that turns things into nightmare scenarios and always looks for the easiest way out, usually by quitting. 

4.My career goals will become ever farther and harder to reach. I'm nervous about delaying my future career into the unforeseeable future.

**Pros:** 1. Even though I LOVE the material in these classes (General Psychology and Music History) It's been a terrible semester already and it's just started, it would be stupid to not recognize I'm worse off than before and need to bail NOW. 

2. I have a steady job that I really like and have a great relationship with my coworkers and managers. 

3. I could work more rather than study and so pay off those loans quicker over time. 

4. I've been dealing with a lot of personal/spiritual stuff so its no wonder things are going bad, my mind is in too many places. And that's already its default mode so my thinking has been getting REALLY out there now.

5. I've been ignoring hobbies I love, like reading philosophy and science, running (I used to love to run my brains out, but now I'm an unhealthy sofa spud), playing music, hanging out with friends, and dedicating much needed time to my family. Maybe that's why it seems my depression has only been getting worse. I did the same stuff last year in college as well. Completely ignoring everything I liked doing and trying (but failing) to focus everything on work/school.

6. I haven't even come close to figuring out how to manage my ADHD, how to study, or other stuff that I should learn properly to become an adult. Struggling with school is only gonna slow that down, if not make it worse. Me not having managed my ADHD also makes me struggle with school even more. Fun viscous cycle there right?

7. My future is pretty undetermined, really. I don't HAVE to go to college, get a degree, and start my lifelong career. I don't have to even stick to this career as I move on in life. I recognize that there are more important things to me and I can change who I am whenever the time is right, whenever I want.

RudeRoman,1525150348,/r/college/comments/8g5xio/practically_stuck_committing_to_college_i_hate/,"I’m posting here because I don’t really know what to do and I don’t really know how to cope with the situation (and theres a good chance I’ll delete this later) I am tired and upset so there’s gonna be a lot of rambling. At the time of writing this it is 11:57pm on the night before decision have to be made and I’m practically stuck going to a college I really don’t like. So I went through the college process as normal however I made the mistake of applying to way too many safety’s and way to to many reaches and not enough target schools. Of the safety schools, I forced to apply to UMaine Orono by my mom despite my disliking . Well acceptance letters time came around and unsurprisingly I get waitlisted/ rejected from all the reaches, got into my safety’s , and got into the couple targets applied to. I narrowed down my list to about three colleges, Wentworth, Florida Tech, and UMaine, (two targets, one safety, didn’t consider anymore safety’s because they were expensive and not good schools) Umaine ended up in that group because it was so cheap and as backup. Eventually i visited Wentworth, and I’m a small school/city type person so of course I liked it a lot as well as I enjoyed the program, I’m also from Boston so being in the middle of the city was a big +. When I went to visit UMaine, I absolutely hated it. The campus felt so isolated being all the way up north, I didn’t really enjoy the type of people who go there (mostly but not all party kids, I don’t really mix in with that crowd) and I was less than impressed with their engineering program (I would be going for mechanical, and that’s the branch that had the worst facilities as well as of the only engineerings that weren’t guaranteed Co-op/rarely got it)(also most of their job placement is in northern Maine, and I don’t think I would be able to mentally handle living up there for more than a week). I eventually had to rule out Florida tech as I did not have time to visit/too expensive to fly down. Fast forward a little bit later when Financial aid packets start to role in. Wentworth is almost twice as expensive as Maine and they gave me little no aid. I tried appealing for more aid but they gave only $2000. This made the Wentworth net cost $39,000, making it almost half of my parents income and 11,000 more that Maine (which is 28,000 a year). On top of that with my brother currently in college, we would have to $5000 a month, which is insane. So in the end, I am stuck with these two options: Go to an overpriced college that I enjoy(but can barely afford), or a cheap college that I hate. Wentworth pros: nice facilities, good campus, strong co-op, a college I like Cons: overpriced for what you get, hard to transfer if I didn’t like it. Maine Pros: cheap, easier to transfer cons: the campus, the people, the program. My biggest issue was although i liked Wentworth a lot, money just can’t be ignored as well as I don’t know if it’s worth the money (it’s a good school, not a great school). However my other biggest issue was I honestly really don’t like Maine as well as there’s no guarantee I’d be able to transfer and if I couldn’t I’d be stuck. After talking it out with my friend and siblings, although it’s a really tough one for me, I think I’m going to have to put my deposit down for Maine because I really don’t want to be a financial burden on my family and I’d feel really guilty if I put down for wentworth (although my parents keep telling me it’s still an option). It just seems like the most logical course of action even though it doesn’t really help me personally and any way. I know at the end of the day it’s just college and it sounds like I’m being dramatic. but it’s really taking a toll on me emotionally for some reason. I can’t help but start crying whenever I think about my fait (and Im not normally the emotional type). Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future? 

TL;DR-I was forced to apply a college that I wasn’t interested in (Umaine). Got in, visited it, hated it. Fast forward and I’m stuck between deciding to go to an Overpriced college I like a lot but would barely be able to afford (wentworth) or going to a cheap college that I honestly really dislike (Umaine). Because I didn’t want to be a severe financial burden, I am choosing Umaine, but it’s really taking a toll on me mentally/emotionally for some reason and I don’t know how to cope with it. 

Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future?

I come from a family of psychologists/counselors/social workers, so I'm worried that I just did what they said would be best for me without actually thinking about what I wanted out of life. I've realized I would actually like to be an artist, a writer, an actor, or work in creative field. That is neither here nor there, though, as far as this post goes.

I just graduated at the end of April with my MSW degree. I have been looking for a job, but it has been pretty tough. The one organization that keeps calling me back has been a place that pays a flat rate of $15 an hour, which yes is above poverty line, but also is a bit below what I was hoping for after getting a master's degree. I don't know if I should cave and take a job there just so I have someplace to go during the day and get some experience, or if I should hold out for a couple more months and keep searching. The work at this organization would be highly stressful (to me at least), so I think that part of what I'm doing is holding out for fair pay. Unfortunately in this field, low salaries seem like the norm.

Additionally, I am having major doubts about being able to do clinical work. While I was in school, I felt like I had some real clarity about what I wanted. I enjoyed my classes (though in retrospect I'm pissed because the majority of the classes were kind of a joke and did not prepare us enough at all for what it would be like actually working), I liked all my social work friends, and I connected with the mission of the profession as a whole. Multiple professors told me that I was talented and skilled at clinical work, and I don't think they were just saying it to massage my ego. After my second internship working in mental health veterans, however, I really felt my attitude towards this work really shift. I started to feel completely drained by the work, and dreaded going in every day. All these thoughts about making a career change were playing in my head constantly. I didn't feel rewarded by the work I did, I just felt damaged by having to listen to all these awful stories I was hearing from people and helpless with how little I could do with them. I felt very cynical about the organization I worked at, too, where the caseload was extremely high. I've now begun to believe that this is the posture of a lot of organizations. After all, if a place is only going to pay $15 an hour to work with the severely mentally ill, how much do they really value their workers?

Now I don't know what to do. I've realized I really care about helping people, and I think I would make a good counselor, but I don't know that I can handle the stress of it. I really care about the LGBT population, people living with HIV/AIDs, and numerous other social causes, but I don't know how to turn those interests into a job. 

As negative as I feel I'm coming off right now, I do not feel like social work is incredibly far off from what I want to do, I just don't know if I want to do the clinical work, or work with the ""mentally ill"". I mean, I've got my own damn problems, I can't be absorbing every body else's left and right.  

In graduate school, there was a social work track that involved policy/leadership, but I don't know how to find those jobs practically speaking. I was encouraged by a professor to look into the social work PhD program, and it is tempting because unlike a doctorate in psychology, a doctorate in social work would probably involve more research and teaching, both of which I really like. But as much as I love being in school, I feel it's the last thing I need right now.  I don't want to be four years into a PhD program and realize I can't handle that either. Would it  even make sense to get a PhD in social work if I felt like I was too sensitive to handle the actual practice of it? 

Ultimately, I'm feeling very scared right now, and I feel like in addition to being bummed out about being unemployed, I'm bummed out because I chose a very high stress career that won't pay off. If you've read any of this, I thank you, and applaud your tenacity for dealing with a boring whiner.
